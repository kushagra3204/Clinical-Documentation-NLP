1CHAPTER 1General PharmacologyIntroduction (Deﬁnitions and Sources of Drugs)  PH1.1, PH1.59I Pharmacology: It is the science that deals with the effects of drugs on living systems.I Drug: W o r l d  H e a l t h  O r g a n i z a t i o n  (W H O )  d e ﬁ n e s  d r u g  a s  ‘any substance or product that is used or intended to be used to modify or explore physiological systems or pathological states for the beneﬁt of the recipient’.I Pharmacokinetics: It means the movement of drug within the body; it includes the processes of absorption (A), distribution (D), metabolism (M) and excretion (E). It means ‘what the body does to the drug’ .I Pharmacodynamics: It is the study of drugs – their mechanism of action, phar-macological actions and their adverse effects. It covers all the aspects relating to ‘what the drug does to the body’ .I Pharmacy: It is the branch of science that deals with the preparation, preserva-tion, standardization, compounding, dispensing and proper utilization of drugs.I Therapeutics: It is the aspect of medicine concerned with the treatment of diseases.I Chemotherapy: It deals with treatment of infectious diseases/cancer with chemi-cal compounds that cause relatively selective damage to the infecting organism/cancer cells.I T oxicology: It is the study of poisons, their actions, detection, prevention and treatment of poisoning.I Clinical pharmacology: It is the systematic study of a drug in man, both in healthy volunteers and in patients. It includes the evaluation of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, safety, efﬁcacy and adverse effects of a drug by com-parative clinical trials.I Essential medicines: According to WHO, essential medicines are ‘those that sat-isfy the healthcare needs of majority of the population’ . They should be of assured quality, available at all times, in adequate quantities and in appropriate dosage forms. They should be selected with regard to disease prevalence in a country, evidence on safety and efﬁcacy, and comparative cost-effectiveness. The examples are iron and folic acid preparations for anaemia of pregnancy, antitubercular drugs like isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, etc.I Orphan drugs: Drugs that are used for diagnosis, treatment or prevention of rare diseases. The expenses incurred during the development, manufacture and marketing of drug cannot be recovered by the pharmaceutical company from selling the drug, e.g. digoxin antibody (for digoxin toxicity), fomepizole (for methyl alcohol poisoning), etc.I Over-the-counter drugs (OTC drugs, nonprescription drugs): These drugs can be sold to a patient without the need for a doctor’s prescription, e.g. paracetamol, antacids, etc.I Prescription drugs: These are drugs which can be obtained only upon producing the prescription of a registered medical practitioner, e.g. antibiotics, antipsychotics, etc.

2PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESSOURCES OF DRUG INFORMATIONPharmacopoeia: It is a book which contains a list of established and ofﬁcially approved drugs with description of their physical and chemical characteristics and tests for their identiﬁca-tion, purity, methods of storage, etc. Some of the pharmacopoeias are the Indian Pharmaco-poeia (IP), the British Pharmacopoeia (BP), and the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP).Other sources of drug information are National Formulary (NF), Martindale – the Extra Pharmacopoeia, Physician’s Desk Reference (PDR), American Medical Associa-tion Drug Evaluation, textbooks and journals of pharmacology and therapeutics, drug bulletins, databases like Micromedex, Medline, Cochrane Library, etc. Information can also be obtained from pharmaceutical companies through their medical representa-tives, meetings and drug advertisements in journals.Formulary: It provides information about the available drugs in a country – their use, dose, dosage forms, adverse effects, contraindications, precautions, warnings and guid-ance on selecting the right drug for a range of conditions.DRUG NOMENCLATURE  PH1.9Drugs usually have three types of names, which are as follows: 1. Chemical name: It denotes the chemical structure of a drug, e.g. acetylsalicylic acid is the chemical name of aspirin and N-acetyl-p-aminophenol is of paracetamol. It is not suitable for use in a prescription. 2 .  Nonproprietary name: It is assigned by a competent scientiﬁc body/authority, e.g. the United States Adopted Name (USAN) council. WHO* along with its member countries select and recommend the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) for a drug. So, it is uniform throughout the world and denotes the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Few older drugs have more than one nonpro-prietary name, e.g. the opioid, pethidine and meperidine. The INN is commonly used as generic name. Ideally, generic names should be used in prescriptions be-cause it is economical and generally uniform all over the world than the branded counterparts. Examples are aspirin and paracetamol are generic names. 3. Proprietary name (brand name): It is given by the drug manufacturers. Brand names are short and easy to recall. Drugs sold under brand name are expensive as compared to their generic version. A drug usually has many brand names – it may have different names within a country and in different countries. Brand names can also be used in prescriptions. Disprin is a brand name of aspirin; Crocin for paracetamol.Chemical nameNonproprietary nameProprietary name/brand nameAcetylsalicylic acidAspirin• Disprin• EcosprinN-acetyl-p- aminophenol(Acetaminophen)Paracetamol• Crocin• Metacin• Tylenol*S Kopp-Kubel.

31—GENERAL PHARMACOLOGYSOURCES OF DRUGSThey are natural, semisynthetic and synthetic. Natural sources are plants, animals, min-erals, microorganisms, etc. Semisynthetic drugs are obtained from natural sources and are later chemically modiﬁed. Synthetic drugs are produced artiﬁcially.The different sources of drugs: 1. Plants: a. Alkaloids are nitrogen containing compounds, e.g. morphine, atropine, quinine, reserpine, ephedrine. b. Glycosides contain sugar group in combination with nonsugar through ether  linkage, e.g. digoxin, digitoxin. c. Volatile oils have aroma. They are useful for relieving pain (clove oil), as carmi-native (eucalyptus oil), ﬂavouring agent (peppermint oil), etc. d. Resins are sticky organic compounds obtained from plants as exudate, e.g. tincture benzoin (antiseptic). 2. Animals: Insulin, heparin, antisera. 3. Minerals: Ferrous sulphate, magnesium sulphate. 4. Microorganisms: Penicillin G, streptomycin, griseofulvin (antimicrobial agents), streptokinase (ﬁbrinolytic). 5. Semisynthetic: Hydromorphone, hydrocodone. 6. Synthetic: Most of the drugs used today are synthetic, e.g. aspirin, paracetamol.Drugs are also produced by genetic engineering (DNA recombinant technology), e.g. human insulin, human growth hormone and hepatitis B vaccine.Routes of Drug Administration  PH1.11Most of the drugs can be administered by different routes. Drug- and patient-related factors determine the selection of routes for drug administration. These factors are 1. Characteristics of the drug. 2. Emergency/routine use. 3. Condition of the patient (unconscious, vomiting and diarrhoea). 4. Age of the patient. 5. Associated diseases. 6. Patient’s/doctor’s choice (sometimes).RoutesLocalSystemicEnteral– Oral– Sublingual– Rectal– TransdermalParenteral– Injection– InhalationRoutes of drug administration

4PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESLOCAL ROUTESIt is the simplest mode of administration of a drug at the site where the desired action is required. Systemic side effects are minimal. 1. T opical: Drug is applied to the skin or mucous membrane at various sites for localized action. a. Oral cavity: As suspension, e.g. nystatin; as a troche, e.g. clotrimazole (for oral candidiasis); as a cream, e.g. acyclovir (for herpes labialis); as ointment, e.g. 5% lignocaine hydrochloride (for topical anaesthesia); as a spray, e.g. 10% ligno-caine hydrochloride (for topical anaesthesia). b. GI tract: As tablet which is not absorbed, e.g. neomycin (for sterilization of gut before surgery). c. Rectum and anal canal: 1) As an enema (administration of drug into the rectum in liquid form):I Evacuant enema (for evacuation of bowel): For example, soap water enema – soap acts as a lubricant and water stimulates rectum.I Retention enema: For example, methylprednisolone in ulcerative colitis. 2) As a suppository (administration of the drug in a solid form into the rectum), e.g. bisacodyl suppository for evacuation of bowel. d. Eye, ear and nose: As drops, ointment and spray (for infection, allergic condi-tions, etc.), e.g. gentamicin – eye and ear drops. e. Bronchi: As inhalation, e.g. salbutamol, ipratropium bromide, etc. (for bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). f. Vagina: As tablet, cream, pessary, etc. (for vaginal candidiasis). g. Urethra: As jelly, e.g. lignocaine. h. Skin: As ointment, cream, lotion, powder, e.g. clotrimazole (antifungal) for cutaneous candidiasis. 2 .  Intra-arterial route: This route is rarely employed. It is mainly used during diag-nostic studies, such as coronary angiography and for the administration of some anticancer drugs, e.g. for treatment of malignancy involving limbs. 3. Administration of the drug into deep tissues by injection, e.g. administration of triamcinolone directly into the joint space in rheumatoid arthritis.SYSTEMIC ROUTESDrugs administered by this route enter the blood and produce systemic effects.Enteral RoutesThey include oral, sublingual and rectal routes.Oral Route. It is the most common and acceptable route for drug administration. Dosage forms are tablet, capsule, powder, syrup, linctus, mixture, suspension, etc., e.g. paracetamol tablet for fever, omeprazole capsule for peptic ulcer are given orally. Tablets could be coated (covered with a thin ﬁlm of another substance) or uncoated. They are also available as chewable (albendazole), dispersible (aspirin), mouth dissolving  (ondansetron) and sustained release forms. Capsules have a soft or hard shell.AdvantagesI Safer.I Cheaper.I Painless.

Fig. 1.1  Injectable routes of drug administration.

71—GENERAL PHARMACOLOGYIntramuscular (i.m.) Route.  Drugs are injected into large muscles, such as deltoid, glu-teus maximus and vastus lateralis, e.g. paracetamol, diclofenac, etc. A volume of 5–10 mL can be given at a time.AdvantagesI Absorption is more rapid as compared to oral route.I Mild irritants, depot injections, soluble substances and suspensions can be given by this route.DisadvantagesI Aseptic conditions are needed.I Intramuscular (i.m.) injections are painful and may cause abscess.I Self-administration is not possible.I There may be injury to nerves.Intravenous (i.v.) Route.  Drugs are injected directly into the blood stream through a vein. Drugs are administered as 1. Bolus: Single, relatively large dose of a drug injected rapidly or slowly into a vein, e.g. i.v. ranitidine in bleeding peptic ulcer. 2. Slow intravenous injection: For example, i.v. morphine in myocardial infarction. 3. Intravenous infusion: F o r  e x a m p l e ,  d o p a m i n e  i n f u s i o n  i n  c a r d i o g e n i c  s h o c k ;  mannitol infusion in cerebral oedema; ﬂuids infused intravenously in dehydration.AdvantagesI Bioavailability is 100%.I Quick onset of action, so it is the route of choice in emergency, e.g. intravenous diazepam to control convulsions in status epilepticus.I Large volume of ﬂuid can be administered, e.g. intravenous ﬂuids in patients with severe dehydration.I Highly irritant drugs, e.g. anticancer drugs can be given because they get diluted in blood.I Hypertonic solution can be infused by intravenous route, e.g. 20% mannitol in cerebral oedema.I By i.v. infusion, a constant plasma level of the drug can be maintained, e.g. dopamine infusion in cardiogenic shock.DisadvantagesI Local irritation may cause phlebitis.I Self-administration is usually not possible.I Strict aseptic conditions are needed.I Extravasation of some drugs (e.g. noradrenaline) can cause injury, necrosis and sloughing of tissues.I Depot preparations cannot be given by i.v. route.PrecautionsI Drug should usually be injected slowly.I Before injecting, make sure that the tip of the needle is in the vein.Intrathecal Route.

Ocusert: It is kept beneath the lower eyelid in glaucoma. It releases the drug slowly for a week following a single application, e.g. pilocarpine ocusert. 2. Progestasert: It is an intrauterine contraceptive device that releases progesterone slowly for a period of one year. 3. Liposomes: They are minute vesicles made of phospholipids into which the drug is incorporated. They help in targeted delivery of drugs, e.g. liposomal formula-tion of amphotericin B for fungal infections. 4. Monoclonal antibodies: They are immunoglobulins, produced by cell culture, selected to react with a speciﬁc antigen. They are useful for targeted delivery of drugs, e.g. delivery of anticancer drugs using monoclonal antibodies. 5. Drug-eluting stents: e.g. paclitaxel releasing stents used in coronary angioplasty. 6. Computerized, miniature pumps, e.g. insulin pump for continuous subcutaneous delivery of insulinPharmacokinetics  PH1.4Pharmacokinetics is derived from two words: Pharmacon meaning drug and kinesis meaning movement.

91—GENERAL PHARMACOLOGYabsorption (A), distribution (D), metabolism (M) and excretion (E). All these pro-cesses involve movement of the drug molecule through various biological membranes.All biological membranes are made up of a lipid bilayer. Drugs cross various bio-logical membranes by the following mechanisms: 1 .  Passive diffusion: It is a bidirectional process. The drug molecules move from a region of higher to lower concentration until equilibrium is attained. The rate  of diffusion is directly proportional to the concentration gradient across the membrane. Lipid-soluble drugs are transported across the membrane by passive diffusion. It does not require energy and is the process by which majority of the drugs are absorbed. 2 .  Active transport: Drug molecules move from a region of lower to higher concen-tration against the concentration gradient. It requires energy, e.g. transport of sympathomimetic amines into neural tissue, transport of choline into cholinergic neurons and absorption of levodopa from the intestine. In primary active trans-port, energy is obtained by hydrolysis of ATP . In secondary active transport, energy is derived from transport of another substrate (either symport or antiport). 3. Facilitated diffusion: This is a type of carrier-mediated transport and does not require energy. The drug attaches to a carrier in the membrane, which facilitates  its diffusion across the membrane. The transport of molecules is from the region of higher to lower concentration, e.g. transport of glucose across muscle cell mem-brane by a transporter GLUT 4. 4. Filtration: Filtration depends on the molecular size and weight of the drug. If drug molecules are smaller than the pores, they are ﬁltered easily through the  membrane. 5. Endocytosis: The drug is taken up by the cell through vesicle formation. Absorp-tion of vitamin B12–intrinsic factor complex in the gut is by endocytosis.DRUG ABSORPTION  PH1.4Movement of a drug from the site of administration into the blood stream is known as  absorption.Factors Inﬂuencing Drug Absorption 1. Physicochemical properties of the drug: a. Physical state: Liquid form of the drug is better absorbed than solid formulations. b. Lipid-soluble and unionized form of the drug is better absorbed than water-soluble and ionized form. c. Particle size: Drugs with smaller particle size are absorbed better than larger ones, e.g. microﬁne aspirin, digoxin and griseofulvin are well absorbed from the gut and produce better effects. Some of the anthelmintics have larger par-ticle size. They are poorly absorbed through gastrointestinal (GI) tract, hence they produce better effect on gut helminths. d. Disintegration time: It is the time taken for the formulation (tablet or capsule) to break up into small particles and its variation may affect the bioavailability. e. Dissolution time: It is the time taken for the particles to go into solution. Shorter the time, better is the absorption. f. Formulations: Pharmacologically inert substances like lactose, starch, calcium sulphate, gum, etc. are added to formulations as binding agents. These are not totally inert and may affect the absorption of drugs, e.g. calcium reduces the absorption of tetracyclines.

10PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES
 2 .  Route of drug administration: A drug administered by intravenous route bypasses the process of absorption as it directly enters the circulation. Some drugs are highly polar compounds, ionize in solution and are not absorbed through GI tract, hence are given parenterally, e.g. gentamicin. Drugs like insulin are administered paren-terally because they are degraded in the GI tract on oral administration. 3. pH and ionization: Strongly acidic (heparin) and strongly basic (aminoglycosides) drugs usually remain ionized at all pH, hence they are poorly absorbed (Fig. 1.3). 4. Food: Presence of food in the stomach can affect the absorption of some drugs. Food decreases the absorption of rifampicin, levodopa, etc., hence they should be taken on an empty stomach for better effect. Milk and milk products decrease the absorption of tetracyclines. Fatty meal increases the absorption of griseofulvin. 5. Presence of other drugs: Concurrent administration of two or more drugs may affect their absorption, e.g. ascorbic acid increases the absorption of oral iron. Antacids reduce the absorption of tetracyclines. 6. Area of the absorbing surface: Normally, drugs are better absorbed in small in-testine because of a larger surface area. Resection of the gut decreases absorption of drugs due to a reduced surface area. 7. Gastrointestinal and other diseases: In gastroenteritis, there is increased peristal-tic movement that decreases drug absorption. In achlorhydria, absorption of iron from the gut is reduced. In congestive cardiac failure, there is GI mucosal oedema that reduces absorption of drugs.BIOAVAILABILITYIt is the fraction of a drug that reaches systemic circulation from a given dose. Intrave-nous route of drug administration gives 100% bioavailability as it directly enters the circulation. The term bioavailability is used commonly for drugs given by oral route.If two formulations of the same drug produce equal bioavailability, they are said to be bioequivalent. If formulations differ in their bioavailability, they are said to be  bioinequivalent.Factors Affecting Bioavailability. The factors which affect drug absorption (physico-chemical properties of the drug, route of drug administration, pH and ionization, food, Weakly basic drugs(morphine, amphetamine)Unionized formBetter absorbed fromthe intestineAlkaline pHAcidicpHUnionized formWeakly acidic drugs(barbiturates)Better absorbedfrom the stomachininFig. 1.3  Effect of pH and ionization on drug absorption.

111—GENERAL PHARMACOLOGY
presence of other drugs, area of absorbing surface, GI and other diseases) also affect bio-availability of a drug. Other factors that affect the bioavailability of a drug are discussed as follows: 1. First-pass metabolism (First-pass effect, presystemic elimination): When drugs are administered orally, they have to pass via gut wall n portal vein n liver n systemic circulation (Fig. 1.4). During this passage, certain drugs get metabolized and are removed or inactivated before they reach the systemic circulation. This process is known as ﬁrst-pass metabolism. The net result is a decreased bioavail-ability of the drug and diminished therapeutic response, e.g. drugs like lignocaine (liver), isoprenaline (gut wall), etc.Consequences of high ﬁrst-pass metabolism: 1) Drugs which undergo extensive ﬁrst-pass metabolism are administered parenterally, e.g. lignocaine is administered intravenously in ventricular  arrhythmias. 2) Dose of a drug required for oral administration is more than that given by other systemic routes, e.g. nitroglycerin. 2. Hepatic diseases: They result in a decrease in drug metabolism, thus increasing the bioavailability of drugs that undergo high ﬁrst-pass metabolism, e.g. pro-pranolol and lignocaine. 3 .  Enterohepatic cycling: Some drugs are excreted via bile but after reaching the in-testine they are reabsorbed n liver n bile n intestine and the cycle is repeated – such recycling is called enterohepatic circulation and it increases bioavailability as well as the duration of action of the drug, e.g. morphine and doxycycline.DRUG DISTRIBUTION  PH1.4Distribution is deﬁned as the reversible transfer of drugs between body-ﬂuid compart-ments. After absorption, a drug enters the systemic circulation and is distributed in the body ﬂuids. Various body-ﬂuid compartments for a 70-kg person can be depicted as follows:
Fig. 1.4  First-pass metabolism.

12PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESTBW (42 L)ECF (14 L)Plasma(3 L)Interstitial ﬂuidcompartment(10.5 L)Transcellular ﬂuidcompartment (0.5 L)ICF (28 L)ECF, extracellular ﬂuid; ICF, intracellular ﬂuid; TBW, total body water.Apparent Volume of DistributionApparent volume of distribution (aVd) is deﬁned as the hypothetical volume of body ﬂuid into which a drug is uniformly distributed at a concentration equal to that in plasma, assuming the body to be a single compartment.aVTotaladministeredamountofdrugConcd/H11005eentrationofthedruginplasmaI Drugs with high molecular weight (e.g. heparin) or extensively bound to plasma protein (e.g. warfarin) are largely restricted to the vascular compartment, hence their aVd is low.I If aVd of a drug is about 14–16 L (0.25 mL/kg in a person weighing 70 kg), it indi-cates that the drug is distributed in the ECF, e.g. gentamicin, streptomycin, etc.I Small water-soluble molecules like ethanol are distributed in total body water – aVd is approximately 42 L.I Drugs which accumulate in tissues have a volume of distribution which exceeds total body water, e.g. chloroquine (13,000 L) and digoxin (500 L). Haemodialysis is not useful for removal of drugs with large aVd in case of overdosage.I In congestive cardiac failure, Vd of some drugs can increase due to an increase in ECF volume (e.g. alcohol) or decrease because of reduced perfusion of tissues.I In uraemia, the total body water can increase which increases Vd of small water-soluble drugs. T oxins which accumulate can displace drugs from plasma protein binding sites resulting in increased concentration of free form of drug which can leave the vascular compartment leading to an increase in Vd.I Fat:lean body mass ratio – highly lipid-soluble drugs get distributed to the adipose tissue. If the ratio is high, the volume of distribution for such a drug will be higher; fat acts as a reservoir for such drugs.Redistribution (see p. 178)Highly lipid-soluble drug, such as thiopentone, on intravenous administration, immedi-ately gets distributed to the areas of high blood ﬂow, such as brain, and causes general an-aesthesia. Immediately within few minutes, it diffuses across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) into blood and then to the less perfused tissues, such as muscle and adipose tissue. This is called redistribution, which results in termination of drug action. Thiopentone has a very short duration of action (5–10 minutes) and is used for induction of general anaesthesia.Drug Reservoirs or Tissue StorageSome drugs are concentrated or accumulated in tissues or some organs of the body, which can lead to toxicity on chronic use, e.g. tetracyclines – bones and teeth; thiopen-tone and DDT – adipose tissue; chloroquine – liver and retina; digoxin – heart, etc.

131—GENERAL PHARMACOLOGYBlood–Brain BarrierThe capillary boundary that is present between blood and brain is called blood—brain  barrier (BBB). In the brain capillaries, the endothelial cells are joined by tight junctions. Only the lipid-soluble and unionized form of drugs can pass through BBB and reach the brain, e.g. barbiturates, diazepam, volatile anaesthetics, amphetamine, etc. Lipid-insol-uble and ionized particles do not cross the BBB, e.g. dopamine and aminoglycosides.Pathological states like meningitis and encephalitis increase the permeability of the  BBB and allow the normally impermeable substances to enter the brain, e.g. penicillin G in normal conditions has poor penetration through BBB, but its penetrability in-creases during meningitis and encephalitis.Placental BarrierDrugs administered to a pregnant woman can cross placenta and reach the fetus. Passage across placenta is affected by lipid solubility, degree of plasma protein binding, presence of transporters, etc. Quaternary ammonium compounds, e.g. d-tubocurarine (d-TC) and substances with high molecular weight like insulin cannot cross the placental barrier.PLASMA PROTEIN BINDING  PH1.4Many drugs bind to plasma proteins like albumin, /H92511 acid glycoprotein, etc.Clinical importance of plasma protein binding 1. AbsorptionDrugEnters circulationBinds to plasma protein (acidic drugs to albumin, basic drugs to α1 acid glycoprotein)Free form (pharma-cologically active)Bound form (cannot exert pharmacologicalaction, acts as a ‘temporary store’ of the drug) 2. Drugs that are highly bound to plasma proteins have a low volume of distribution. 3. Plasma protein binding delays the metabolism of drugs. 4. Bound form is not available for ﬁltration at the glomeruli. Hence, excretion of highly plasma protein bound drugs by ﬁltration is delayed. 5. Highly protein bound drugs have a longer duration of action, e.g. sulphadiazine is less plasma protein bound and has a duration of action of 6 hours, whereas sulphadoxine is highly plasma protein bound and has a duration of action of  1 week. 6. In case of poisoning, highly plasma protein bound drugs are difﬁcult to be removed by haemodialysis. 7. In disease states like anaemia, renal failure, chronic liver diseases, etc. plasma albumin levels are low (hypoalbuminaemia). So, there will be a decrease in bound form and an increase in free form of the drug, which can lead to drug toxicity. 8. Plasma protein binding can cause displacement interactions. More than one drug can bind to the same site on plasma protein. The drug with higher afﬁnity will displace the one having lower afﬁnity and may result in a sudden increase in the free concentration of the drug with lower afﬁnity.

14PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESBIOTRANSFORMATION (Drug Metabolism)  PH1.4Chemical alteration of the drug in a living organism is called biotransformation. The  metabolism of a drug usually converts lipid-soluble and unionized compounds into water-soluble and ionized compounds, hence not reabsorbed in the renal tubules and are excreted. If the parent drug is highly polar (ionized), then it may not get metabo-lized and is excreted as such.Sites: Liver is the main site for drug metabolism; other sites are GI tract, kidney, lungs, blood, skin and placenta.The end result of drug metabolism is inactivation, but sometimes a compound with pharmacological activity may be formed as shown below: 1. Active drug to inactive metabolite: This is the most common type of metabolic transformation.Phenobarbitone  HydroxyphenobarbitonePhenytoin  p-Hydroxyphenytoin 2. Active drug to active metaboliteCodeine  MorphineDiazepam  Oxazepam 3. Inactive drug (prodrug) to active metaboliteLevodopa  DopaminePrednisone  PrednisoloneProdrugIt is an inactive form of a drug, which is converted to an active form after metabolism.Uses of Prodrugs (Advantages) 1 .  To  i m p rove  b i o av a i l a b i l i t y : Parkinsonism is due to deﬁciency of dopamine. Dopa-mine itself cannot be used since it does not cross BBB. So, it is given in the form of a prodrug, levodopa. Levodopa crosses the BBB and is then converted into dopamine.LevodopaDopa decarboxylaseLevodopaDopamineBBB 2. T o prolong the duration of action: Phenothiazines have a short duration of action, whereas esters of phenothiazine (ﬂuphenazine) have a longer duration  of action. 3. T o improve taste: Clindamycin has a bitter taste, so clindamycin palmitate sus-pension has been developed for paediatric use to improve the taste. 4. T o provide site-speciﬁc drug delivery:acidic pH of urineMethenamineFormaldehyde (acts as urinary antiseptic)Pathways of Drug Metabolism.  Drug metabolic reactions are grouped into two phases. They are Phase I or nonsynthetic reactions and Phase II or synthetic reactions.Phase I Reactions (Table 1.1). Oxidation: Addition of oxygen or removal of hydrogen is called oxidation. It is the most important and common metabolic reaction.I Oxidation reactions are mainly carried out by cytochrome P450, cytochrome P450 reductase, molecular O2 and NADPH.I There are several cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.

151—GENERAL PHARMACOLOGY
I They are numbered as 1,2,3,4… (to denote families) and each as A, B, C, D (subfamilies).I More than 50% of drugs undergo biotransformation reactions by CYP3A4/5. Other enzymes include CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2E1, CYP2C19, etc.Reduction: Removal of oxygen or addition of hydrogen is known as reduction.Hydrolysis: Breakdown of the compound by addition of water is called hydrolysis. This is common among esters and amides.Cyclization: Conversion of a straight chain compound into ring structure.Decyclization: Breaking up of the ring structure of the drug.At the end of phase I, the metabolite may be active or inactive.Phase II Reactions (Table 1.2). Phase II consists of conjugation reactions. If the phase I metabolite is polar, it is excreted in urine or bile. However, many metabolites are lipo-philic and undergo subsequent conjugation with an endogenous substrate, such as glucuronic acid, sulphuric acid, acetic acid or amino acid. These conjugates are polar, usually water-soluble and inactive.Not all drugs undergo phase I and phase II reactions in that order. In case of isoniazid (INH), phase II reaction precedes phase I reaction (Fig. 1.5).OxidationAddition of oxygen/removal of hydrogenPhenytoin, phenobarbitone, pento-barbitone, propranololReductionRemoval of oxygen/addition of hydrogenChloramphenicol, methadoneHydrolysisBreak down of compound by addition of waterEsters – procaine, succinylcholineAmides – lignocaine, procainamideCyclizationConversion of straight chain compound into ring structureProguanilDecyclizationBreaking up of the ring structure of the drugPhenobarbitone, phenytoinTable 1.1  Phase I reactions

Drug-Metabolizing EnzymesThey are broadly divided into two groups – microsomal and nonmicrosomal enzyme  systems (Table 1.3).Hofmann EliminationDrugs can be inactivated without the need of enzymes – this is known as Hofmann elimi-nation. Atracurium, a skeletal muscle relaxant, undergoes Hofmann elimination.Factors Affecting Drug Metabolism 1. Age: Neonates and elderly metabolize some drugs to a lesser extent than adults. In these cases, it is due to diminished amount/activity of hepatic microsomal enzymes. Neonates conjugate chloramphenicol more slowly, hence develop toxicity – grey baby syndrome. Increased incidence of toxicity with propranolol and lignocaine in elderly is due to their decreased hepatic metabolism. 2. Diet: Poor nutrition can decrease enzyme function. 3. Diseases: Chronic diseases of liver may affect hepatic metabolism of some drugs, e.g. increased duration of action of diazepam, in patients with cirrhosis, due to its impaired metabolism.DrugPhase IPhase IPhase I Phase II Phase II Phase IIUnchangedform

171—GENERAL PHARMACOLOGY 4 .  Genetic factors (pharmacogenetics): These factors also inﬂuence drug metabo-lism. The study of genetically determined variation in drug response is called pharmacogenetics a. Slow and fast acetylators of isoniazid: There is an increased incidence of pe-ripheral neuritis with isoniazid in slow acetylators. The fast acetylators require a larger dose of the drug to produce therapeutic effect. b. Succinylcholine apnoea: Succinylcholine, a neuromuscular blocker, is metabolized by plasma pseudocholinesterase enzyme. The duration of action of succinylcholine is 3–6 minutes. However, some individuals have atypical pseudocholinesterase that metabolizes the drug very slowly. This results in prolonged succinylcholine apnoea due to paralysis of respiratory muscles, which is dangerous. c. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deﬁciency and haemolytic anaemia: G6PD activity is important to maintain the integrity of the RBCs. A person with G6PD deﬁciency may develop haemolysis when exposed to certain drugs like sulphonamides, primaquine, salicylates, dapsone, etc. 5. Simultaneous administration of drugs: This can result in increased or decreased metabolism of drugs (see enzyme induction or inhibition).Enzyme Induction. Repeated administration of certain drugs increases the synthesis of microsomal enzymes. This is known as enzyme induction. The drug is referred to as an enzyme inducer, e.g. rifampicin, phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, griseofulvin, etc.Clinical Importance of Microsomal Enzyme Induction 1. Enzyme induction may accelerate the metabolism of drugs, thus reducing the du-ration and intensity of drug action leading to therapeutic failure, e.g. rifampicin and oral contraceptives. Rifampicin induces the drug metabolizing enzyme of oral contraceptives, thus enhancing its metabolism and leading to contraceptive failure. 2. Autoinduction may lead to development of drug tolerance, e.g. carbamazepine enhances its own metabolism. 3. Enzyme induction can lead to drug toxicity, e.g. increased incidence of hepatotox-icity with paracetamol in alcoholics is due to overproduction of toxic metabolite of paracetamol. 4. Prolonged phenytoin therapy may produce osteomalacia due to enhanced me-tabolism of vitamin D3. 5. Enzyme inducers, e.g. barbiturates, can precipitate porphyria due to overproduc-tion of porphobilinogen. 6. Enzyme induction can also be beneﬁcial, e.g. phenobarbitone in neonatal jaundice – phenobarbitone induces glucuronyl transferase enzyme, hence bilirubin is  conjugated and jaundice is resolved.Enzyme Inhibition. Certain drugs, e.g. chloramphenicol, ciproﬂoxacin, erythromycin, etc. inhibit the activity of drug metabolizing enzymes and are known as enzyme in-hibitors. Inhibition of metabolism of one drug by another can occur when both are metabolized by the same enzyme. Enzyme inhibition is a rapid process as compared to enzyme induction.Clinical Relevance of Enzyme Inhibition.  Enzyme inhibition can result in drug toxicity, e.g. increased incidence of bleeding with warfarin, due to concomitant administration of erythromycin or chloramphenicol, etc. These drugs inhibit drug metabolizing enzyme of warfarin resulting in increased plasma concentration of warfarin and enhanced anticoagu-lant effect (bleeding). T oxicity following inhibition of metabolism is signiﬁcant for those 

18PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESdrugs which have saturation kinetics of metabolism. Enzyme inhibition can be beneﬁcial, e.g. boosted protease inhibitor regimen used for treatment of HIV infection (see p. 436).DRUG EXCRETION  PH1.4Removal of the drug and its metabolite from the body is known as drug excretion. The main channel of excretion of drugs is the kidney; others include lungs, bile, faeces, sweat, saliva, tears, milk, etc. 1. Kidney: The processes involved in the excretion of drugs via kidney are glo-merular ﬁltration, passive tubular reabsorption and active tubular secretion.  Glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion facilitate drug excretion, whereas tubular reabsorption decreases drug excretion.Rate of renal excretion /H11005 (Rate of ﬁltration /H11001 Rate of secretion) – Rate of reabsorption 1) Glomerular ﬁltration: Drugs with small molecular size are more readily ﬁltered. The extent of ﬁltration is directly proportional to the glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR) and to the fraction of the unbound drug in plasma. 2) Passive tubular reabsorption: The main factor affecting passive reabsorption is the pH of renal tubular ﬂuid and the degree of ionization. Strongly acidic  and strongly basic drugs remain in ionized form at any pH of urine, hence are excreted in urine. a) Weakly acidic drugs (e.g. salicylates, barbiturates) in acidic urine remain mainly in ‘unionized’ form, so they are reabsorbed into the circulation. If the pH of urine is made alkaline by sodium bicarbonate, the weakly acidic drugs get ‘ionized’ and are excreted easily. b) Similarly, weakly basic drugs (e.g. morphine, amphetamine, etc.) in alka-line urine remain in ‘unionized’ form, hence are reabsorbed. If the pH of urine is made acidic by vitamin C (ascorbic acid), these weakly basic drugs get ‘ionized’ and are excreted easily. 3) Active tubular secretion: It is a carrier-mediated active transport which re-quires energy. Active secretion is unaffected by changes in the pH of urine and protein binding. Most of the acidic drugs (e.g. penicillin, diuretics, pro-benecid, sulphonamides, etc.) and basic drugs (e.g. quinine, procaine, mor-phine, etc.) are secreted by the renal tubular cells. The carrier system is rela-tively nonselective and therefore drugs having similar physicochemical properties compete for the same carrier system, e.g. probenecid competi-tively inhibits the tubular secretion of penicillins, thereby increasing the duration of action as well as the plasma half-life and effectiveness of penicil-lins in the treatment of diseases, such as gonococcal infections. 2. Lungs: Alcohol and volatile general anaesthetics, such as ether, halothane, isoﬂu-rane, sevoﬂurane and ether are excreted via lungs. 3. Faeces: Drugs like purgatives, e.g. senna, cascara, etc. are excreted in faeces 4. Bile: Some drugs are secreted in bile. They are reabsorbed in the gut while a small portion is excreted in faeces, e.g. tetracyclines. 5. Skin: Metals like arsenic and mercury are excreted through skin. 6. Saliva: Certain drugs like potassium iodide, phenytoin, metronidazole and lith-ium are excreted in saliva. Salivary estimation of lithium may be used for nonin-vasive monitoring of lithium therapy. 7. Milk: Drugs taken by lactating women may appear in milk. They may or may not adversely affect the breast fed infant. Drugs like penicillins, erythromycin, etc. are safe for use but amiodarone is to be avoided in mothers during breast feeding.

191—GENERAL PHARMACOLOGYPHARMACOKINETIC PARAMETERSThe important pharmacokinetic parameters are bioavailability, volume of distribution, plasma half-life (t1/2) and clearance.Plasma Half-Life (t1/2)It is the time required for the plasma concentration of a drug to decrease by 50% of  its original value (Fig. 1.6A). Plasma half-life of lignocaine is 1 hour and for aspirin it is 4 hours.Clinical Importance of Plasma Half-Life.  It helps toI determine the duration of drug action.I determine the frequency of drug administration.I estimate the time required to reach the steady state. At steady state, the amount of drug administered is equal to the amount of drug eliminated in the dose interval. It takes approximately four to ﬁve half-lives to reach the steady state during re-peated administration of the drug. A drug is almost completely eliminated in four to ﬁve half-lives after single administration.ClearanceClearance (CL) of a drug is deﬁned as that volume of plasma from which the drug is  removed in unit time.ClearanceRate of eliminationPlasma conce /H11005nn t r a t i o n o f t h e d r u g 1. First-order kinetics: A constant fraction of the drug in the body is eliminated per unit time.For example, assume drug ‘A ’ with plasma t1/2 of 1 hour following ﬁrst-order kinet-ics of elimination and having an initial plasma concentration of 100 mcg/mL. 1 hour 1 hour100 mcg/mL  50 mcg/mL  25 mcg/mL ½½If its concentration is increased to 200 mcg/mL, a constant fraction (1/2) gets eliminated in unit time, i.e. after 1 hour, concentration is 100 mcg/mL.The rate of drug elimination is directly proportional to its plasma concentration. The t1/2 o f t h e  d r u g s  f o l l o wi n g  ﬁ r s t - o r d e r  k i n e t i c s  wi l l  a l w a y s  r e m a i n  c o n-stant. The drug will be almost completely eliminated in four to ﬁve plasma half-lives if administered at a constant rate at each half-life. Most of the drugs follow ﬁrst-order kinetics. 2 .  Zero-order kinetics: A constant amount of a drug in the body is eliminated per unit time. For example, ethanol is eliminated from the body at the rate of about  10 mL/h.Assume a drug ‘B’ with an initial plasma concentration of 200 mcg/mL and eliminated at a constant amount of 10 mcg per unit time. The concentration  will be 190 mcg/mL after 1 hour and 100 mcg/mL after 10 hours. So, half-life is 10 hours.1 hour 1 hour 200 mcg/mL  190 mcg/mL  180 mcg/mL 10 mcg 10 mcgIf its concentration is increased to 300 mcg/mL, concentration will be 290 mcg/mL after 1 hour (as constant amount 10 mcg per unit time is eliminated) and

(B)Steady state
Fig. 1.6  (A) Plasma half-life of a drug after single intravenous injection. (B) Steady state: achieved after approximately four to ﬁve half-lives during repeated administration at a constant rate.Note: Phenytoin exhibits saturation kinetics and its plasma concentration has to be care-fully monitored (therapeutic drug monitoring, TDM) when used in the treatment of epilepsy. Once the kinetics changes to zero order, an increase in dose will result in a marked increase in plasma concentration leading to drug toxicity.Steady-State ConcentrationIf constant dose of a drug is given at constant intervals at its t1/2, plasma concentration of the drug increases due to its absorption and falls due to elimination in each dosing interval. Finally, the amount of drug eliminated will equal the amount of drug admin-istered in the dosing interval. The drug is said to have reached steady-state or plateau level (Fig. 1.6B). It is attained after approximately four to ﬁve half-lives.Target Level StrategyThe dosage of drug is calculated to achieve the desired plasma steady state concentration of the drug which produces therapeutic effect with minimal side effects.Loading dose: Initially, a large dose or series of doses of a drug is given with the aim of rapidly attaining the target level in plasma. This is known as loading dose. A  loading dose is administered if the time taken to reach steady state is relatively more as 150 mcg/mL after 15 hours. The half-life increases to 15 hours. Thus, the t1/2 of the drug following zero-order kinetics is never constant. The rate of elimina-tion is independent of plasma drug concentrationDrugs like phenytoin and aspirinAt low doses, follow ﬁrst-order kineticsAs the plasma concentration increases Elimination processes get saturatedKinetics changes over to zero order (saturation kinetics) 

211—GENERAL PHARMACOLOGYcompared to the patient’s condition, e.g. the half-life of lignocaine is more than 1 hour, so it takes more than 4–6 hours to reach the target concentration at steady state. When a patient has life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias after myocardial infarction, initially a large dose of lignocaine has to be given to achieve desired plasma concentration quickly. Once it is achieved, it is maintained by giving the drug as an intravenous infusion.Maintenance dose: The dose of a drug which is repeated at ﬁxed intervals or given as a continuous infusion to maintain target level in plasma or steady-state concentration is known as maintenance dose. The dose administered is equal to dose eliminated in a dosing interval.Therapeutic Drug Monitoring  PH1.2Monitoring drug therapy by measuring plasma concentration of a drug is known as  therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM).Indications of TDM 1. Drugs with narrow therapeutic index, e.g. lithium, digoxin, phenytoin, aminogly-cosides, etc. 2. Drugs showing wide interindividual variations, e.g. tricyclic antidepressants. 3. T o ascertain patient compliance. 4 .  For drugs whose toxicity is increased in the presence of renal failure, e.g. aminoglycosides. 5. In patients who do not respond to therapy without any known reason.In drug poisoning, estimation of plasma drug concentration is done.TDM is not required in the following situations: 1. When clinical and biochemical parameters are available to assess response: a. Blood pressure measurement for antihypertensives. b. Blood sugar estimation for antidiabetic agents. c. Prothrombin time, aPTT and International Normalized Ratio (INR) for anti-coagulants. 2. Drugs producing tolerance, e.g. opioids. 3. Drugs whose effect persists longer than the drug itself, e.g. omeprazole.Fixed-Dose Combinations (FDCs; Fixed-Dose Ratio Combinations)  PH1.59It is the combination of two or more drugs in a ﬁxed-dose ratio in a single formulation.Some of the examples of WHO approved FDCs areI Levodopa /H11001 carbidopa for parkinsonismI Isoniazid /H11001 rifampicin /H11001 pyrazinamide /H11001 ethambutol for tuberculosis.I Ferrous sulphate /H11001 folic acid for anaemia of pregnancyI Sulphamethoxazole /H11001 trimethoprim in cotrimoxazole (antimicrobial agent)I Amoxicillin /H11001 clavulanic acid (antimicrobial agent)I Oestrogen /H11001 progesterone (oral contraceptive)Advantages and disadvantages of FDCs are explained in Table 1.4, p. 22.Methods to Prolong the Duration of Drug ActionProlongation of action of a drug helpsI to reduce the frequency of drug administration.I to improve patient compliance.I to minimize ﬂuctuations in plasma concentration.

22PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES
Various methods to prolong the duration of drug action are 1. By retarding drug absorption: a. For orally administered drugs:I Using sustained release/controlled release preparations: Sustained release prep-arations consist of drug particles, which have different coatings that dissolve at different intervals of time. It prolongs the duration of action of the drug, reduces the frequency of administration and improves patient compliance, e.g. tab. diclofenac has a duration of action of 12 hours, whereas diclofenac sustained release preparation has a duration of action of 24 hours. b. For parenterally administered drugs:I By decreasing the vascularity of the absorbing surface: This is achieved by adding a vasoconstrictor to the drug, e.g. adrenaline with local anaesthet-ics. When adrenaline is added to a local anaesthetic, the vasoconstriction produced by adrenaline will delay the removal of the local anaesthetic from the site of administration and prolongs the duration of its action. It also reduces the systemic toxicity of the local anaesthetic and minimizes bleeding in the operative ﬁeld.I By decreasing the solubility of the drug: by combining it with a water-insoluble compound, e.g. combining procaine/benzathine with penicillin G.I Injection penicillin G has a duration of action of 4–6 hours.I Injection procaine penicillin G: It has a duration of action of 12–24 hours.I Injection benzathine penicillin G: It has a duration of action of 3–4 weeks.I By combining the drug with a protein, e.g. protamine zinc insulin – the complexed insulin is released slowly from the site of administration, thus prolonging its action.I By esteriﬁcation: Esters of testosterone, e.g. testosterone propionate and testosterone enanthate are slowly absorbed following intramuscular admin-istration resulting in prolonged action.I Injecting the drug in oily solution, e.g. depot progestins (depot medroxypro-gesterone acetate).I Pellet implantation: e.g. norplant for contraception.I Transdermal patch (see p. 7) 2. By increasing the plasma protein binding of the drug, e.g. sulphadiazine is less bound to plasma proteins and has duration of action of 6 hours. Sulphadoxine is highly protein bound and so has duration of action of 1 week.AdvantagesDisadvantages 1. Increased patient compliance 2. Prevents development of mi-crobial resistance in diseases like TB, AIDS, etc. as missing of single drug is prevented 3. Increased efﬁcacy 4. Reduced side effects 5. Reduced cost 6. Synergistic effect 1. Inﬂexible ﬁxed-dose ratio 2. Incompatible pharmacokinetics can interfere with action of the drug 3. Increased toxicity due to inappropriate combina-tions. If adverse effect occurs, difﬁcult to identify the component of FDC causing it 4. The preparation cannot be used if there is a  contraindication for use of one component 5. Physician and pharmacist’s ignorance of the  contentsTable 1.4  Advantages and disadvantages of FDCs

231—GENERAL PHARMACOLOGY 3. By inhibiting drug metabolism: For example, allopurinol /H11001 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP). 6-MP is metabolized by xanthine oxidase. Allopurinol (xanthine oxidase inhibitor) n inhibits metabolism of 6-MP n prolongs action of 6-MP . 4. By delaying renal excretion of the drug, e.g. penicillin/cephalosporins with pro-benecid (see p. 36).PharmacodynamicsPharmacodynamics (Greek pharmacon: drug; dynamis: power). It covers all aspects re-lating to ‘what the drug does to the body’ . It is the study of drugs – their mechanism of action, pharmacological actions and adverse effects.TYPES OF EFFECTS OF A DRUG 1. Stimulation: Some drugs act by increasing the activity of speciﬁc organ/system, e.g. adrenaline stimulates the heart resulting in an increase in heart rate and force  of contraction. 2. Depression: Some drugs act by decreasing the activity of speciﬁc organ/system, e.g. alcohol, barbiturates, general anaesthetics, etc. depress the central nervous system. 3. Irritation: Certain agents on topical application can cause irritation of the skin and adjacent tissues. When an agent on application to the skin relieves deep seated  pain, it is known as counterirritant, e.g. eucalyptus oil, methyl salicylate, etc. They are useful in sprain, joint pain and myalgia. They exert their action byI reﬂexly increasing local circulation in deeper structures.I blocking impulse conduction in the spinal cord. 4. Cytotoxic: Drugs are selectively toxic for the infecting organism/cancer cells, e.g. antibiotics/anticancer drugs. 5. Replacement: When there is a deﬁciency of endogenous substances, they can be replaced by drugs, e.g. insulin in diabetes mellitus, thyroxine in cretinism and myxoedema, etc.MECHANISM OF DRUG ACTION  PH1.5Mechanism of action of drugsNonreceptor mediatedReceptor mediatedNonreceptor-Mediated Mechanism of Action of Drugs 1. By physical action: a. Osmosis: Some drugs act by exerting an osmotic effect, e.g. 20% mannitol in cerebral oedema and acute congestive glaucoma. b. Adsorption: Activated charcoal adsorbs toxins; hence, it is used in the treatment of drug poisoning. c. Demulcent: Cough syrup produces a soothing effect in pharyngitis by coating the inﬂamed mucosa. d. Radioactivity: Radioactive isotopes emit rays and destroy the tissues, e.g. 131I in hyperthyroidism.

24PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES 2. By chemical action: a. Antacids are weak bases – they neutralize gastric acid – useful in peptic ulcer. b. Metals like iron, copper, mercury, etc. are eliminated from the body with the help of chelating agents. These agents trap metals and form water-soluble com-plexes, which are rapidly excreted from the body, e.g. dimercaprol (BAL) in arsenic poisoning, desferrioxamine in iron poisoning and d-penicillamine in copper poisoning. 3. Through enzymes: Some drugs act by inhibiting the enzyme activity. a. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, such as captopril, enala-pril, etc. act by inhibiting ACE. They are used in the treatment of hyperten-sion, congestive heart failure, etc. b. Xanthine and hypoxanthine are oxidized to uric acid by the enzyme xanthine oxidase, which is inhibited by allopurinol. Allopurinol (competitive inhibitor) is used in the treatment of chronic gout to reduce the synthesis of uric acid.XanthineHypoxanthineUric acidAllopurinol/H11002Xanthine oxidase 4. Through ion channels: Some drugs directly bind to ion channels and alter the ﬂow of ions, e.g. local anaesthetics block sodium channels in neuronal membrane to produce local anaesthesia. 5 .  Through antibody production: Vaccines produce their effect by stimulating the formation of antibodies, e.g. vaccine against tuberculosis (BCG), oral polio vaccine, etc. 6. Transporters: Some drugs produce their effect by binding to transporters. Selec-tive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) n bind to 5-HT transporter n block 5-HT reuptake into neurons n antidepressant effect. 7. Others: Drugs, like colchicine, bind to tubulin and prevent migration of neutro-phils (hence useful in acute gout).Receptor-Mediated Mechanism of Action of DrugsReceptors are macromolecules, present either on the cell surface, cytoplasm or in the nucleus with which the drug binds and interacts to produce cellular changes.Drug(D)Receptor(R)Drug-recepto/H11001/horizontalharpoonextender/arrowrighttophalf/horizontalharpoonextender/arrowleftbothalf/horizontalharpoonextender/horizontalharpoonextenderrrcomplexResponse→For example, adrenergic receptors (/H9251 and /H9252), cholinergic receptors (muscarinic and nicotinic), opioid receptors, etc.Afﬁnity: The ability of the drug to get bound to receptor is known as afﬁnity.Intrinsic activity: The ability of the drug to produce pharmacological action after combining with the receptor is known as intrinsic activity of the drug.Agonist: A drug that is capable of producing pharmacological action after binding to the receptor is called an agonist.Agonist has high afﬁnity /H11001 high intrinsic activity (e.g. morphine and adrenaline).Antagonist: A drug that prevents binding of agonist to its receptor or blocks its effect/s is called an antagonist. It does not by itself produce any effect.

251—GENERAL PHARMACOLOGYCompetitive antagonist has high afﬁnity without intrinsic activity (e.g. naloxone and atropine). It produces receptor blockade.Partial agonist: A drug that binds to the receptor but produces an effect less than that of an agonist is called partial agonist. It inhibits the effect of agonist.Partial agonist has afﬁnity /H11001 less intrinsic activity (e.g. pindolol and buprenorphine).Inverse agonist: It has full afﬁnity towards the receptor but produces effect opposite to that of an agonist, e.g. benzodiazepines (BZDs) produce antianxiety and anticonvul-sant effects by interacting with BZD receptors, but /H9252-carbolines act as inverse agonist at BZD receptor and produce anxiety and convulsions.Inverse agonist has afﬁnity /H11001 intrinsic activity between 0 and –1 (e.g. /H9252-carboline).RECEPTOR FAMILIES (Table 1.5)  PH1.5 1.

It results in the formation or recruitment of molecules (second messengers) that initiate the signalling mechanism in a cell.

This is due to upregulation or supersensitivity of  /H9252-adrenoceptors to catecholamines.Therefore, propranolol should not be discontinued abruptly.Table 1.6  Regulation of receptors

28PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESDOSE–RESPONSE RELATIONSHIPThe pharmacological effect of a drug depends on its concentration at the site of action, which in turn is determined by dose of the drug administered. Such a relationship is called ‘dose–response relationship’ .TYPES OF DOSE–RESPONSE CURVES 1. Graded dose–response: This curve when plotted on a graph takes the form of a rectangular hyperbola, whereas log dose–response curve (DRC) is sigmoid shaped (Fig. 1.7A and B). 2. Quantal DRC: Certain pharmacological effects which cannot be quantiﬁed but can only be said to be present or absent (all or none) are called as quantal responses, e.g. a drug causing ovulation (Fig. 1.7C).Therapeutic IndexTherapeutic index (TI) is an index of drug safety.TIMedian lethal dose (LD ) of the drugM50/H11005ee d i a n e f f e c t i v e d o s e ( E D ) o f t h e d r u g50It is the ratio of median lethal dose to the median effective dose (Fig. 1.8). 1. LD50: It is the dose of a drug, which is lethal for 50% of the population. 2. ED50: It is the dose of drug, which produces the desired effect in 50% of the population.Higher the value of therapeutic index, safer is the drug, e.g. penicillin G has a high therapeutic index; digitalis, lithium and phenytoin have narrow therapeutic index.Drug PotencyThe amount of a drug required to produce a desired response is called potency of the drug. Lower the dose required for a given response, more potent is the drug, e.g. anal-gesic dose of morphine is 10 mg and that of pethidine is 100 mg. Therefore, morphine is ten times more potent than pethidine as an analgesic. DRC of drug A (morphine) and drug B (pethidine, rightward DRC) as analgesic is compared (Fig. 1.9).

Drug EfﬁcacyIt is the maximum effect of a drug, e.g. morphine is more efﬁcacious than aspirin as an analgesic (Fig. 1.10). DRC of drug A (morphine) and drug B (aspirin) as an analgesic is compared.Therapeutic RangeIt is the range of concentration of the drug which produces desired response with minimal toxicity.COMBINED EFFECT OF DRUGSA combination of two or more drugs can result in an increase or a decrease in response.Increased Response 1. Additive effect: The combined effect of two or more drugs is equal to the sum of their individual effect.Effect of drugs A /H11001 B /H11005 Effect of drug A /H11001 Effect of drug BFor example, combination of ibuprofen and paracetamol as analgesic.BA

30PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES 2. Potentiation (supra-additive): The enhancement of action of one drug by an-other drug which is inactive is called potentiation.Effect of drugs A /H11001 B /H11022 Effect of drug A /H11001 Effect of drug BFor example, levodopa /H11001 carbidopa; acetylcholine /H11001 physostigmine.Carbidopa and physostigmine inhibit breakdown of levodopa and acetylcholine,  respectively, thus enhancing their effects. 3. Synergism: When two or more drugs are administered simultaneously, their com-bined effect is greater than that elicited by either drug alone.For example, sulphamethoxazole /H11001 trimethoprim; pyrimethamine /H11001 sulphadoxine.Decreased Response (Drug Antagonism)In antagonism, the effect of one drug is decreased or abolished in the presence of  another drug. 1 .  Physical antagonism: The opposing action of two drugs is due to their physical property, e.g. adsorption of alkaloids by activated charcoal – useful in alkaloid  poisoning. 2. Chemical antagonism: The opposing action of two drugs is due to their chemical property, e.g. antacids are weak bases; they neutralize gastric acid and are useful in peptic ulcer; chelating agents complex metals and are useful in heavy metal poi-soning (dimercaprol in arsenic poisoning). 3 .  Physiological (functional) antagonism: Here, two drugs act at different recep-tors or by different mechanisms on the same physiological system and produce opposite effects, e.g. insulin and glucagon on blood sugar; adrenaline and hista-mine on bronchial smooth muscle – histamine produces bronchoconstriction (via histamine receptors), whereas adrenaline produces bronchodilatation by act-ing through adrenergic (/H92522) receptors – hence, adrenaline helps to reverse bron-chospasm in anaphylactic shock. 4. Receptor antagonism: The antagonist binds to the same receptor as the agonist and inhibits its effects. It can be competitive or noncompetitive. a. Competitive antagonism (equilibrium type): In competitive antagonism, both agonist and the antagonist bind reversibly to same site on the receptor.For example,AcetylcholineAtropineMuscarinic receptorsMorphine(Agonists)Naloxone(Antagonists)Opioid receptors Equilibrium type of competitive antagonism can be overcome (reversible)  by increasing concentration of the agonist. The log DRC of the agonist shows a rightward parallel shift in the presence of competitive antagonist (Fig. 1.11).Nonequilibrium antagonism: The antagonist binds to the same site on the receptor as agonist but binding is irreversible. The antagonist forms strong covalent bond with the receptor, e.g. phenoxybenzamine is an irreversible antagonist of adrenaline at /H9251 receptors. b. Noncompetitive antagonism: The antagonist binds to a different site on the receptor and prevents the agonist from interacting with the receptor. In this type, the antagonistic effect cannot be overcome by increasing the concentra-tion of the agonist. There is a ﬂattening of the DRC in noncompetitive an-tagonism, e.g. diazepam and bicuculline (Fig. 1.12).

(Adapted from Alfred Gilman Sr. and Louis S. Goodman: Goodman & Gilman’s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 12e.)Factors Modifying Drug ActionThere are a number of factors which can inﬂuence drug response. Individuals may often show quantitative variations in drug response but rarely show qualitative variations. The important factors are described in Table 1.7.DRUG FACTORS 1. Route of administration: When a drug is administered by different routes, it com-monly exhibits quantitative variations, but sometimes it may also result in qualita-tive variations in response. a. Quantitative variation: Oral dose of drugs are usually larger than intravenous dose (since i.v. route produces 100% bioavailability), e.g. for analgesic effect, in-travenous dose of morphine required is 5–10 mg whereas oral dose is 30–60 mg. Onset of drug action following intravenous administration is rapid.

32PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES
 b. Qualitative variation: The drug may produce an entirely different response when administered by different routes, e.g. magnesium sulphate administered orally produces purgative effect; parenterally, it causes CNS depression and on local application reduces oedema in the inﬂamed area. 2. Presence of other drugs: See addition, potentiation, synergism and antagonism. 3. Cumulation: If the elimination of a drug is slow, then repeated administration of such drug will result in its accumulation in the body causing toxicity, e.g. digoxin, emetine and chloroquine.PATIENT FACTORS 1. Age: In neonates, metabolizing function of liver and excretory function of kidney is not fully developed, e.g. chloramphenicol can cause grey baby syndrome when given to neonates as the metabolizing enzymes are not fully developed. In adults, penicillin G is given 6 hourly, but in infants it is given 12 hourly as the excretory function is not completely developed. In the elderly, renal and hepatic functions progressively decline. The incidence of adverse effect of drugs is also relatively more, and hence drug doses have to be reduced accordingly, e.g. dose of amino-glycosides in elderly is less than normal adult dose.The dose of a drug for a child can be calculated as follows:Young's formula: Child doseAgeAge 12/H11005/H11001/H11003adult doseDilling's formula: Child doseAge20adu/H11005/H11003ll t d o s e 2. Body weight and body surface: An average dose of a drug is usually calculated in terms of body weight (mg/kg).DoseBody weight (kg)70Average adult d/H11005/H11003oo s eIn obese individuals and in patients with dehydration or oedema, dose calcula-tion on the basis of body weight is not very appropriate. A more accurate method Drug factorsPatient factors• Route of administration• Age• Presence of other drugs• Body weight• Cumulation• Sex• Environment• Genetic factor• Psychological factor• Pathological state• Tolerance• Drug dependenceTable 1.7  Factors inﬂuencing drug response

331—GENERAL PHARMACOLOGYfor calculating a dose is on the basis of the body surface area (BSA) of the  patient. Nomograms are available to calculate BSA from height and weight of  the patient.Since it is inconvenient to calculate BSA, dose is routinely calculated on body weight basis. Dose of anticancer drugs and a few other drugs are calculated on the basis of BSA. 3. Sex: Drugs like /H9252 blockers, diuretics and clonidine can cause decreased libido in males. 4. Diet and environmental factors: Milk reduces absorption of tetracyclines; fatty meal increases the absorption of griseofulvin (antifungal agent). Cigarette smoke induces hepatic microsomal enzymes and increases metabolism of drugs, such as theophylline. So, the dose of the drug administered may be inadequate in smokers. 5. Genetic factor: For example, fast and slow acetylators of isoniazid, prolonged suc-cinylcholine apnoea, primaquine induced haemolysis in G6PD deﬁciency indi-viduals (see p. 17 under metabolism). Other examples are as follows-I Acute porphyriaBarbiturates may precipitate attacks of acute intermittent porphyria in suscep-tible individuals by inducing ALA (aminolevulinic acid) synthase enzyme that catalyses the production of porphyrins.I Malignant hyperthermiaIn some patients, dangerous rise in body temperature (malignant hyperther-mia) may occur especially when halothane–succinylcholine combination is used due to genetic abnormality.I In person with shallow anterior chamber/and or narrow iridocorneal angle, mydriatics may precipitate acute congestive glaucoma.I There is an increased risk of bleeding with coumarin anticoagulants due re-duced activity of metabolizing enzyme, CYP2C9. 6. Psychological factor: Personality of the doctor as well as the patient can affect response to a drug. Some patients respond to inert dosage forms (placebo) in conditions like pain, bronchial asthma, anxiety, etc.Placebo effect: ‘Placebo’ is a Latin term that means ‘I will please’. It is a dummy medi-cine having no pharmacological activity. The effect produced by placebo is called placebo effect. Sugar tablets and distilled water injection are used as placebos. 1) Uses a) Placebos are used for the relief of subjective symptoms like anxiety, head-ache, tremors, pain, insomnia, etc. b) Placebos are used in clinical trials in order to minimize bias. 2) Factors affecting placebo effect are: a) Patient factor: Patients with neurotic symptoms often respond to place-bos. b) Drug factor: The placebo response can be affected by the physical pre-sentation or route of administration of the drug, e.g. colourful tablets, such as red, blue, green and injectable preparations give better placebo effect. c) Doctor factor: Personality of the doctor, motivation, way of instruction, doctor–patient relationship, etc. are important factors that also affect  response to placebo. 7. Pathological states: a. GI disorders: Achlorhydria reduces the absorption of weakly acidic drugs in stomach by causing their ionization. In malabsorption syndrome, absorption of some drugs is reduced.

34PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES b. Liver disease: In chronic liver diseases, metabolism of drugs is greatly reduced. This will increase bioavailability of drugs having high ﬁrst-pass metabolism, e.g. propranolol. c. Renal failure: Clearance of drugs that are excreted through kidney is impaired, e.g. the incidence of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity with aminoglycosides is more in the presence of renal failure. d. Absorption of iron from the gut is increased in iron deﬁciency anaemia. 8. T olerance: It means ‘need for larger doses of a drug to produce a given response’ . T olerance develops to nasal decongestant effect of ephedrine on repeated use. Patients on organic nitrates for angina develop tolerance on long-term therapy. T olerance is commonly seen with drugs like morphine, alcohol, amphetamine, etc. a. Types of tolerance
Species tolerance  Racial toleranceNatural toleranceGenetically determined reduced/lack of response to a drugAcquired toleranceTo l e r a n ce
Some species are tolerant to certain drugs, e.g. rabbits can tolerate large doses of atropineSome races show tolerance to certain drugs, e.g. blacks are tolerant to mydriaticsIt develops on repeated exposure to a drug, sometimes, tolerance develops only to certain effects, e.g. on repeated use of morphine, tolerance develops to its euphoriant effect but not to its miotic effect   b. Mechanism of development of tolerance: It could be pharmacokinetic or phar-macodynamic tolerance. 1) Pharmacokinetic tolerance (dispositional tolerance): It is due to reduced con-centration of the drug at the site of action – may be as a result of decreased absorption, increased metabolism and excretion. For example, rifampin induces the metabolizing enzyme of oral contraceptives, enhances their metabolism, leading to contraceptive failure. 2) Pharmacodynamic tolerance (functional tolerance): T h e  d r u g  e f f e c t  i s  r e-duced, which may be due to downregulation of receptors or decrease in receptor-coupled signal transduction. Repeated use of opioids, barbitu-rates, etc. results in the development of tolerance due to decrease in the number of receptors (downregulation). c. Cross-tolerance: The phenomenon of tolerance exhibited by closely related (structural and mechanistic) drugs is called cross-tolerance, e.g. among ni-trates, among opioids, between ether and alcohol. d. Tac hy phy lax is (tachy /H11005 rapid; ph ylaxis/H11005 protection;  acute toleranc e): Repeated use of certain drugs at short intervals may result in rapid decrease in pharmaco-logical response. This is known as tachyphylaxis or acute tolerance, e.g. tyramine, ephedrine and amphetamine. These drugs act by releasing noradrenaline from adrenergic nerve endings. Repeated administration of the drug causes gradual depletion of the neurotransmitter and hence reduction in the response (Fig. 1.13). 9. Drug dependence: See p. 39.

351—GENERAL PHARMACOLOGY
Drug Interactions  PH1.8When two or more drugs are given simultaneously, the effects of one drug may be al-tered by another drug. Drug interactions can occur in vitro (outside the body) or in vivo (inside the body).Drug interactionsIn vitroIn vivoPharmacokinetic interactionsPharmacodynamic interactionsDrug interactions can result in either beneﬁcial or harmful effects.Pharmaceutical interactions: These can occur as a result of incompatibility (physical or chemical) of a drug with an intravenous solution or when two or more drugs are mixed in the same syringe/i.v. infusion. This may result in precipitation or inactivation of one or more drugs.Phenytoin should not be administered in dextrose solution as it gets precipitated.Dextrose solution is not suitable for i.v. infusion of ampicillin as it is unstable at acidic pH of dextrose.Gentamicin and carbenicillin should not be given in the same infusion as it may  result in loss of potency.Pharmacokinetic interactions: These occur when one drug alters the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of another drug.I Absorption: Antacids (containing aluminium, magnesium and calcium), iron, etc. inter-fere with the absorption of tetracyclines by forming unabsorbable complexes with it.Some drugs affect absorption of other drugs by altering GI motility. Metoclo-pramide increases the rate of gastric emptying and promotes absorption of aspirin.Effect of repeated doses of ephedrine on BPesn o pse R
Fig. 1.13  Tachyphylaxis. BP , blood pressure.

36PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESI Distribution: Plasma protein binding can cause displacement interactions. More than one drug can bind to the same site on plasma protein. The drug with higher afﬁnity will displace the one with lower afﬁnity. This results in increase in concen-tration of unbound drug, e.g. salicylates displace warfarin from binding sites  resulting in increased free warfarin levels and enhanced anticoagulant effect.I Metabolism: This occurs when metabolism of one drug is increased (enzyme in-duction) or decreased (enzyme inhibition) by another drug, e.g. carbamazepine induces the metabolizing enzyme of warfarin, thus enhancing its metabolism and leading to decreased anticoagulant effect. Erythromycin inhibits the metabolizing enzyme of carbamazepine and may increase its toxicity.I Excretion: Most of them occur in kidney.I Salicylates interfere with the excretion of methotrexate and potentiate its toxicity.I Probenecid decreases renal tubular secretion of penicillins/cephalosporins and prolongs their duration of action (beneﬁcial interaction).Pharmacodynamic interactions: The interaction is due to action of drugs on recep-tors or physiological system. This may result in either additive, synergistic or antagonis-tic effects (see pp. 29, 30). The interaction may result in harmful effects, e.g. enhanced nephrotoxicity seen with the concurrent use of aminoglycosides and amphotericin B; it may also result in beneﬁcial effect, e.g. levodopa and carbidopa in parkinsonism.Rational Use of MedicinesAccording to WHO, rational use of medicines requires that ‘patients receive medications appropriate to their clinical needs in doses that meet their own individual requirements for an adequate period of time and at the lowest cost to them and their community’.It involves the administration of right drug, right dose, right duration, right cost to the right patient.EXAMPLES OF IRRATIONAL PRESCRIBINGI Drug not prescribed as per standard treatment guidelines.I Unnecessary use of drugs, e.g. antibiotics for viral infections.I Underuse of drugs, e.g. not prescribing oral rehydration solution in acute diarrhoea.I Incorrect use of a drug, e.g. selection of wrong drug, use of incorrect route and dose of a drug.I Use of medicines with doubtful efﬁcacy, e.g. appetite stimulants.I Prescribing banned drugs, e.g. cisapride.I Use of irrational combinations, e.g. ampicillin and cloxacillin for staphylococcal infections.I Prescribing expensive medicines unnecessarily when cheaper, equally effective drugs are available.I Polypharmacy.Hazards of Irrational Use of DrugsI Therapeutic failure.I Increased incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs).I Emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms.I Increase in cost of treatment.I Financial burden to society.I Loss of patient’s faith in the doctor.

371—GENERAL PHARMACOLOGYRational Prescribing (WHO)I A diagnosis has to be made.I The problem has to be deﬁned.I The therapeutic goals to be achieved, e.g. relief of symptoms, cure, etc. has to be set.I The right drug - appropriate route, dose and duration of treatment has to be selected. Write a complete prescription.I Proper instructions and information about the drug should be given.I Monitor therapy.Adverse Drug Effects  PH1.7ADVERSE EFFECTAdverse effect is deﬁned as any undesirable or unwanted effect of a drug. The WHO- suggested deﬁnition of ADR and adverse event (AE) are as follows:ADR: Any response which is noxious, unintended and which occurs at doses normally used in humans for prophylaxis, diagnosis or therapy of disease, or for modiﬁcation of physiological function.AE: Any untoward medical occurrence that may present during treatment with a pharma-ceutical product but which does not necessarily have causal relationship with the treatment.TYPES OF ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONSPredictable Reactions (Type A or Augmented Reactions)These are predictable reactions to a drug which are related to its pharmacological  actions. They include side effects, secondary effects and toxic effects.Unpredictable Reactions (Type B or Bizarre Reactions)These are nondose-related unpredictable reactions to a drug. They are not related to the pharmacological actions of the drug. Allergic reactions and idiosyncrasy are unpredict-able reactions.Predictable ReactionsI Side effects: These are unwanted pharmacological effects of a drug, that are seen with therapeutic doses, e.g. atropine used in the treatment of heart block also produces dryness of mouth, blurring of vision, urinary retention, etc., which are the side effects.I Secondary effects: The primary action of a drug may result in other effects, e.g. im-munosuppression by corticosteroids can lead to development of opportunistic infections, e.g. oral candidiasis.I Toxic effects: These are the effects of a drug, which are either due to overdosage or chronic use, e.g. bleeding due to chronic use/overdosage of anticoagulants and nephrotoxicity with aminoglycosides especially in patients with renal failure.Unpredictable ReactionsI Drug allergy: It is an abnormal response (local or systemic), mediated by immune system, to a drug/foreign antigen. Different types of hypersensitivity reactions are discussed below.I Those associated with humoral antibodies: types I, II and III.I Those associated with cell-mediated immunity: type IV (delayed hypersensitivity).

38PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESType I hypersensitivity (immediate type, anaphylactic) reactionsIt is a rapidly occurring reaction, hence called immediate hypersensitivity reaction. The manifestations are itching, urticaria, hay fever, asthma or even anaphylactic shock. Itch-ing, rhinitis and urticaria are treated with antihistamines,Exposure to certain drugs (penicillin, aspirin, lignocaine)Production of IgE antibodies – ﬁx to mast cellsOn reexposure to the same drugAg–Ab reaction occurs on the mast cell surfaceRelease of mediators (histamine, 5-HT, PGs, LTs, PAF)Hypotension, bronchospasm, angioedema, urticaria, rhinitis and anaphylactic shockAnaphylactic shock is a medical emergency and should be treated promptly with: 1. Inj. adrenaline (1:1000) 0.3–0.5 mL intramuscularly. 2. Inj. hydrocortisone 100–200 mg intravenously. 3. Inj. pheniramine 45 mg intramuscularly/intravenously. 4. Maintenance of patent airway, intravenous ﬂuids.Type II hypersensitivity (cytotoxic) reactionsThe antibodies (IgG and IgM) react with cell-bound antigen and cause activation of  complement, which destroys the cells.IgG and IgM mediatedThe antibody reacts with cell-bound antigensActivation of complementDestruction of cellsAntigenSpecificantibody

391—GENERAL PHARMACOLOGYExamples are: blood transfusion reactions, haemolytic anaemias produced by qui-nine, quinidine, cephalosporins, etc.Type III hypersensitivity (Arthus, serum sickness) reactionsIn this type of reaction, antibodies involved are mainly IgG.AG: AB complexes are formed n Fix complement n Deposition of complexes on vascular endothelium n Destructive inﬂammatory response.For example, serum sickness (fever, urticaria, joint pain, lymphadenopathy) with penicillins and sulphonamides; acute interstitial nephritis with nonsteroidal anti-in-ﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and Stevens–Johnson syndrome with sulphonamides.Type IV hypersensitivity (cell-mediated or delayed hypersensitivity) reactionsIt is mediated by sensitized T lymphocytes. Reexposure to the antigen leads to a local  inﬂammatory response. The manifestations usually occur 1–2 days after exposure to the sensitizing antigen, e.g. contact dermatitis due to local anaesthetic creams, topical anti-biotics and antifungal agents.Types II, III and IV reactions are treated with glucocorticoids.I IdiosyncrasyIt is usually a genetically determined abnormal reaction to drugs, e.g. aplastic anaemia caused by chloramphenicol, prolonged succinylcholine apnoea, hae-molytic anaemia seen with primaquine and sulphonamides.I Drug dependence  PH1.22, PH1.23WHO deﬁnes drug dependence as ‘a state, psychic and sometimes also physical, re-sulting from the interaction between a living organism and a drug characterized by behavioural and other response that always include a compulsion to take the drug on a continuous or periodic basis in order to experience its psychic effects and sometimes to avoid the discomfort of its absence’ , e.g. opioids, alcohol, barbitu-rates, amphetamine, etc. The dependence could be psychological or physical. a. Psychological dependence: There is an intense desire to continue taking the drug as the patients feel that their well-being depends on the drug. b. Physical dependence: Repeated drug use produces physiological changes in the body, which makes continuous presence of the drug in the body neces-sary to maintain normal function. Abrupt stoppage of the drug results in an imbalance wherein the body has to readjust to the absence of the drug result-ing in the development of signs and symptoms known as withdrawal syn-drome. The withdrawal signs and symptoms are generally opposite to the effects produced by the drug.Principles of treatment of drug dependence are: 1. Hospitalization. 2. Substitution therapy: For example, methadone substitution for morphine addiction. 3. Aversion therapy: Disulﬁram for alcohol addiction. 4. Psychotherapy 5. General measures: Maintain nutrition, family support and rehabilitation.I Iatrogenic diseasesIt is physician-induced disease (‘iatros’ is a Greek word, means ‘physician’) due to drug therapy, e.g. parkinsonism due to metoclopramide; acute gastritis and peptic ulcer due to NSAIDs.

40PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES
I TeratogenicityCertain drugs when given during pregnancy may cross the placenta and produce various dangerous effects in the fetus (Table 1.8). This is called teratogenesis.Administration of drugs during early pregnancy (conception to 16 days) could result in abortion; during 2–8 weeks of gestation, it can affect organogenesis and produce structural abnormalities; during second and third trimester, drugs can affect growth and development of the fetus. Hence, drug administration during pregnancy should be restricted.The USFDA (Food and Drug Administration) had placed drugs in various catego-ries (A, B, C, D, X) depending on the risk of the drug to cause birth defects. Category X drugs (e.g. warfarin, methotrexate) was contraindicated for use  during pregnancy as risk to fetus was proven and outweighed beneﬁts of its  use. This system is being replaced by a revised labelling rule which will provide latest information about a drug pertaining to its use during pregnancy.I Carcinogenicity and mutagenicityThe ability of a drug to cause cancer is carcinogenicity and the agent is known as carcinogen. The abnormalities of genetic material in a cell produced by a drug is known as mutagenicity, e.g. anticancer drugs and oestrogens.I Photosensitivity reactionsIt is a drug-induced cutaneous reaction (photoallergy/phototoxicity) following exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Sulphonamides cause photoallergy on expo-sure to light; they produce dermatitis due to immune response (cell mediated). Doxycycline and ﬂuoroquinolones can cause phototoxicity – a local reaction (erythema, blisters) occurs on exposure to UV light. Use of sunscreen and avoid-ance of exposure to sunlight is advised. Calamine lotion and topical steroids are used for treatment.I HepatotoxicitySome of the hepatotoxic drugs are isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, halothane, paracetamol, etc.I Nephrotoxicity (Vancomycin, aminoglycosides, cisplatin, cyclosporine, amphoteri-cin B, tetracyclines [Fanconi syndrome], indinavir, gold salts, nystatin, etc. are nephrotoxic drugs)*I OtotoxicityIt can occur with aminoglycosides, loop diuretics, cisplatin, etc.I Ocular toxicityEthambutol, chloroquine, glucocorticoids, etc. can cause ocular toxicity.DrugTeratogenic effectThalidomidePhocomeliaTetracyclinesYellowish discolouration of teethAntithyroid drugsFetal goitreTable 1.8  Teratogenic effects of some drugs (Note the ‘T’S)

411—GENERAL PHARMACOLOGYPharmacovigilance. It is the ‘science and activities relating to detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects or any other possible drug-related prob-lems’ (WHO). The aim of pharmacovigilance is to improve patient care and safety related to use of drugs, promote rational use of medicines, develop regulations for use of drugs and educate health care professionals about ADRs.  PH1.6Causality assessment: Some of the commonly used tools for causality assessment are Naranjo’s scale and WHO scale.The National Pharmacovigilance Centre is located at Ghaziabad. The International Centre is Uppsala Monitoring Centre in Sweden. Any health care professional, e.g. doc-tors, dentists, nurses and pharmacists can report a suspected adverse drug event. Pa-tients can also report ADRs.Treatment of Poisoning  PH1.52T oxicology is the study of poisons – their actions, detection, prevention and treatment of poisoning. All poisoning cases require hospitalization and careful observation till recovery. Poisoning may be suicidal, homicidal or accidental. All cases of poisoning are medico-legal cases; hence, the police should be informed.GENERAL MANAGEMENT 1. Hospitalization. 2. Airway should be cleared. In comatose patients, there is danger of respiratory obstruction by tongue, secretions and aspiration of vomitus. Hence, patient should be turned to his left lateral side. A cuffed endotracheal tube should be in-serted and secretions should be aspirated regularly. 3. Breathing should be assessed. If there is hypoxaemia, oxygen should be given. Patient may need mechanical ventilation if there is respiratory insufﬁciency. 4. Circulation should be assessed (pulse rate and blood pressure) and an i.v. (intra-venous) line should be maintained. 5. T o prevent further absorption of poison: a. Inhaled poisons (gases): Patient should be moved to fresh air. b. Contact poisons: Contaminated clothes should be removed and the body part should be washed with soap and water. c. Ingested poisons: Gastric lavage can limit the absorption if done within 2–3 hours of poisoning. If patient is unconscious, endotracheal intubation should be done before gastric lavage. Gastric lavage is usually done with normal saline. Other solutions used are lukewarm water, potassium permanganate solution, sodium bicarbonate, etc. Lavage should be repeated till the returning ﬂuid is clear. After the lavage, activated charcoal is administered which adsorbs many drugs and poisons (physical antago-nism). Activated charcoal has a large surface area and is highly porous to bind with poisonous material. Gastric lavage should not be carried out in case of poisoning due to corrosives (except carbolic acid), petroleum products (kerosene), convulsants, etc.Mustard, common salt, ipecac syrup, etc. can be used to induce vomiting and prevent further absorption of ingested poisons. However, this method is rarely practiced now.Laxatives like magnesium sulphate or citrate can be used orally to promote elimination of the ingested poison. Oral polyethylene glycol electrolyte solu-tion can be used for whole bowel irrigation of the GI tract in case of poison-ing due to iron, lithium, cocaine, heroin, foreign bodies, etc.

42PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES
 6. T o promote elimination of absorbed portion of the drugs: a. Diuretics (i.v. mannitol or furosemide) are used to promote the elimination of absorbed portion of the drug. Renal elimination of some of the drugs can be increased by altering the pH of urine, e.g. alkalinization of urine in salicylate poisoning and acidiﬁcation of urine in amphetamine poisoning. b. Dialysis is used in cases of severe poisoning, e.g. lithium, aspirin, methanol, etc. 7. Symptomatic treatment: Intravenous diazepam 5–10 mg if there are convulsions and external cooling for hyperpyrexia. 8. Maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance: Hyponatraemia should be treated with i.v. normal saline and hypernatraemia with i.v. furosemide. Hypokalaemia is treated with potassium chloride, oral or slow i.v. infusion. Oral potassium chlo-ride should be diluted in a tumbler of water to prevent intestinal ulceration. Potas-sium chloride should be given slow intravenously as it has cardiac depressant ef-fect. Rapid injection can cause cardiac arrest and death. Thiazides or furosemide can be used to treat mild hyperkalaemia. Severe hyperkalaemia is treated with 10% calcium gluconate intravenously. Intravenous sodium bicarbonate is used to treat metabolic acidosis.Note: Mnemonic for general management of poisoning: A to H.SPECIFIC MANAGEMENTAntidotes for some poisons are listed in Table 1.9.Poison Information CentresWHO has established poison information centres in AIIMS, New Delhi and Ahmed-abad.

The commonly used pharmacoeconomic analytical methods are cost minimization analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis and cost-beneﬁt analysis.New Drug Development  PH1.64Preclinical studies in animals: Before undertaking clinical trials, sufﬁcient data about the drug must be obtained by testing it in animals. Animal studies generate pharmaco-dynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological data of the drug.TOXICITY STUDIESAcute toxicity studiesAcute toxicity is carried out in two animal species (one rodent, one nonrodent).  Single, graded doses are administered to small groups of animals using two routes – one that is to be used in humans. It is done to determine the general behaviour and median lethal dose (LD50) following exposure to the test drug. LD50 is the dose re-quired to kill 50% of the animals. It is determined in a 24-hour period after admin-istration of the drug.Subacute toxicity studiesThese are done in two species of animals to determine the maximum tolerated dose, identify target organ of toxicity and nature of toxicities. The test drug is administered daily for a period depending on the duration of treatment in humans. Animals are ex-amined for general effects (food intake, change in the body weight, etc.), biochemical and haematological parameters are monitored; histological examination is done.Chronic toxicity studiesDrugs are administered in two species (one rodent and one nonrodent) for 6–12 months. Monitoring is done as in subacute toxicity studies.Special toxicity studiesThese include tests for carcinogenicity, mutagenicity and teratogenic effects of the drug. It also includes effects on reproduction.CLINICAL TRIALS  PH1.64After completion of preclinical testing of the drug, the company ﬁles an investigational new drug (IND) application with the regulatory authority for permission to test the drug in humans. A drug should be scientiﬁcally and ethically evaluated by testing in human beings for safety and efﬁcacy prior to its use in man for therapeutic purposes. Such study in humans is referred to as clinical trial. The principles of bioethics should be upheld during clinical trials. They include autonomy, beneﬁcence, nonmaleﬁcence and justice. Clinical trials are conducted in four phases, I–IV . Usually, the information obtained from one phase is analysed before proceeding to the next phase.

44PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESPhase IThis phase involves testing of the drug in humans for the ﬁrst time. It is carried out in about 10–100 participants. This is usually carried out in healthy volunteers. For drugs with potential toxicity, e.g. anticancer drugs, phase I trials are carried out in cancer  patients. The main objective of this phase is to determine safety of the drug and the maximum tolerated dose. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data can be ob-tained. It is usually carried out by a clinical pharmacologist. No blinding is done (open label study).Phase II (Therapeutic Exploratory Study)It is carried out for the ﬁrst time in patients with target disease for which the drug is  intended to be used. It is conducted in about 50–500 patients and usually in three to four centres. The main objective of this phase is to assess the effectiveness of the drug and to determine effective dose range. Further evaluation of safety and pharmacokinetics is also done. The study is randomized and controlled, may be blinded.Phase III (Therapeutic Conﬁrmation Trial)The aim is to conﬁrm the efﬁcacy of the drug in large number of patients of either sex. It is conducted in multiple centres. It is generally randomized, double blind comparative trial. Further data on kinetics and drug interactions can be obtained. Permission for marketing the drug is granted after successful completion of phase III trials.Phase IV (Postmarketing Surveillance)Once the drug is approved for marketing, postmarketing surveillance is carried out to obtain additional data about beneﬁt and risk of a drug following its long-term use in a larger number of patients. It provides information on adverse reactions, drug interac-tions, new indications and evaluation of different formulations. Postmarketing surveil-lance helps to estimate incidence of adverse reactions, detect previously unknown ad-verse reactions and identify risk factors for the adverse reactions. There are ADR monitoring centres in different parts of the country. The ADRs observed in the patient should be reported to these centres. The drug company has to submit postmarketing data for the drug at regular intervals to the regulatory agency to continue its use.Besides clinical trials, other types of clinical studies are case control study, cohort study and meta-analysis.GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE  PH1.64International Council for Harmonization – Good Clinical Practice (ICH–GCP) guide-lines is an international ethical and scientiﬁc standard for designing, conducting, monitoring, terminating, auditing, reporting and recording trials. It ensures that the data generated from the trials is credible, accurate and the rights, integrity and conﬁden-tiality of the participants are protected.INFORMED CONSENTPrior to enrolling the patient in the trial, the investigator should obtain informed con-sent from the subject. It is a process by which a subject voluntarily conﬁrms his/her willingness to participate in a trial after having been informed of all aspects of the trial relevant to the subject’s decision to participate in the trial. The consent should be ob-tained by the investigator in the subject’s language without exerting undue inﬂuence. 

451—GENERAL PHARMACOLOGYThe informed consent is documented by means of a written, signed and dated (by  both investigator and subject) informed consent form. If a subject is illiterate, his le-gally accepted representative or an impartial witness should be present during in-formed consent process. The thumb impression of the subject is taken and his legally accepted representative should sign and date the informed consent form. In case of young children and mentally ill patients, consent is obtained from their guardian or legal representative.ETHICS COMMITTEEIt is a committee or board designated by the institution to review research proposals and conduct periodic review of research involving humans so as to ensure the protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects. The number of persons in an ethics commit-tee is about 7–15. A minimum of ﬁve persons are required to form the quorum.Composition 1 .  Chairperson (from outside the institution to maintain independence of the committee) 2. Basic medical scientists (preferably one pharmacologist) 3. Clinicians 4. Legal expert or retired judge 5. Social scientist/philosopher/ethicist/theologist 6. Lay person from the community 7. Member secretaryRANDOMIZATIONIt is a process where the subjects are randomly assigned to treatment groups in a clinical  trial using a chance mechanism. This is usually done by a computer. The investigator has no role in deciding the allocation of a particular treatment to a particular patient in the trial. Randomization is done to avoid bias in the constitution of trial group.BLINDINGThe purpose of blinding in a trial is to eliminate bias. It is done to conceal the identity of the drug from the investigator and the subject. It could be single blind or double blind.In a double blind trial, both the investigator and the subject do not know the identity of the drug administered to the subject. In a single blind trial, the subject is unaware of the identity of the drug administered to him. A randomized double blind trial is a stan-dard design for most of the clinical trials.

46CHAPTER 2Autonomic PharmacologyIntroduction to Autonomic Nervous SystemThe nervous system is divided into central nervous system (CNS: brain and spinal cord) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). PNS can be further divided into somatic nervous system and autonomic nervous system (ANS). The differences between these two  systems are given in Table 2.1.Nervous systemCentral nervous system(CNS)Peripheral nervous system(PNS)Autonomic nervoussystem (ANS)Somatic nervoussystemSympathetic system Parasympathetic systemThe ANS has two divisions – sympathetic and parasympathetic. The sympathetic division arises from thoracolumbar region (T1–L3, thoracolumbar outﬂow) and the parasympathetic division arises from two separate regions in the CNS. The cranial outﬂow arises from cranial nerves (III, VII, IX and X) and sacral outﬂow from S2, S3 and S4 spinal roots.In sympathetic system, the preganglionic ﬁbres are short and postganglionic ﬁbres are long. On the contrary, the parasympathetic preganglionic ﬁbres are long and post-ganglionic ﬁbres are short (Fig. 2.1). Most of the visceral organs have dual nerve supply, i.e. they are supplied by both divisions of the ANS, but effects of one system predomi-nate. The ciliary muscle, pancreatic and gastric glands receive only parasympathetic supply; sweat glands, hair follicles, spleen and most of the blood vessels have only sym-pathetic supply. Their stimulation usually produces opposite effect on the innervating organ (Fig. 2.2).Cholinergic System  PH1.14CHOLINERGIC TRANSMISSIONAcetylcholine (ACh) is the neurotransmitter in the cholinergic system. The sites of  cholinergic transmission are shown in Fig. 2.1. The neurons that synthesize, store and release ACh are called cholinergic neurons.

48PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES
Synthesis of Acetylcholine (Fig. 2.3)Choline enters the cholinergic neuron by carrier-mediated transport, where it reacts with acetyl-CoA with the help of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) to form ACh. The ACh is then stored in storage vesicles. It is released into synaptic cleft when an action potential reaches the nerve terminals. The released ACh interacts with cholinergic recep-tors on effector cell and activates them. In the synaptic cleft, ACh is rapidly hydrolysed by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme.CholinesterasesACh is rapidly hydrolysed to choline and acetic acid by enzyme cholinesterases. There are two types of cholinesterase: 1. True cholinesterase or AChE: It is found in cholinergic neurons, ganglia, RBCs and neuromuscular junction (NMJ). It rapidly hydrolyses ACh and methacholine. 2. Pseudocholinesterase or butyrylcholinesterase: It is found in plasma, liver and glial cells. Pseudocholinesterase can act on a wide variety of esters including ACh (hydrolysis is slow) but does not hydrolyse methacholine.Cholinergic ReceptorsThey are divided broadly into two types – muscarinic and nicotinic. Muscarinic recep-tors are further divided into ﬁve different subtypes: M1–M5. Only M1, M2 and M3 are functionally recognized. M4 and M5 subtypes are found in CNS.

Choline EstersCholine esters include ACh, carbachol and bethanechol.Acetylcholine.  ACh produces muscarinic and nicotinic effects by interacting with respective receptors on the effector cells (Table 2.3).Muscarinic Actions 1. Cardiovascular system (a) Heart: The effects of ACh are similar to those following vagal stimulation. ACh, by stimulating M2 receptors of the heart, opens K/H11001 channels resulting in hyperpolarization. Therefore, SA and A V nodal activity is reduced (Fig. 2.4). (b) Blood vessels: ACh stimulates M3 receptors of vascular endothelial cells, which release endothelium-dependent relaxing factor (EDRF; NO) leading to vasodilatation and a fall in blood pressure (BP) (Fig. 2.5). 2. Smooth muscles (a) Gastrointestinal tract (Fig. 2.6) (b) Urinary bladder (Fig. 2.7) (c) Bronchi (Fig. 2.8) 3. Exocrine glands: Increase in salivary, lacrimal, sweat, bronchial, gastric and other gastrointestinal (GI) secretions. 4.

T o elicit nicotinic actions, larger doses of ACh are required. 1. Autonomic ganglia: Higher doses of ACh produce dangerous muscarinic effects especially on the heart. Hence, prior administration of atropine is necessary to elicit nicotinic actions.Higher doses of ACh stimulate both sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia (Fig. 2.10) causing tachycardia and rise in BP . 2. Skeletal muscles: At high concentration, ACh initially produces twitching, fasciculations followed by prolonged depolarization of NMJ and paralysis. 3. Actions on CNS: Intravenously administered ACh does not cause any central effects because of its poor penetration through the blood–brain barrier (BBB).Bethanechol (Table 2.3).  It has selective muscarinic actions on GIT and urinary bladder. It is preferred in postoperative urinary retention and paralytic ileus.Cholinomimetic AlkaloidsThey mimic the actions of ACh; examples are pilocarpine, muscarine and arecoline.

54PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESPilocarpine.  Pilocarpine is a cholinomimetic alkaloid obtained from Pilocarpus plant. It is a tertiary amine. It produces muscarinic and nicotinic effects by directly interacting with the receptors. It has predominant muscarinic actions especially on secretory activity.Uses 1 .  Pilocarpine 0.5%–4% solution is used topically in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma and acute congestive glaucoma. It increases the tone of the ciliary muscle and causes miosis by contracting sphincter pupillae, opens the trabecular meshwork around the canal of Schlemm, facilitates drainage of aqueous humour and reduces intraocular pressure (IOP). It acts rapidly but has short duration of action. Pilocar-pine ocusert that releases the drug slowly over 7 days is available (see p. 8). 2. It is used alternatively with mydriatics to break adhesions between the iris and lens. 3. It is used to reverse the pupillary dilatation after refraction testing. 4. Pilocarpine is used as a sialagogue (drug used to augment salivary secretion).Adverse Effects.  They are salivation, sweating, bradycardia, diarrhoea and broncho-spasm; pulmonary oedema can occur following systemic therapy.Muscarine.  It is an active ingredient of poisonous mushroom, Amanita muscaria and Inocybe species. Some types of mushroom poisoning are explained as follows:Caused by Inocybe species.It is characterized byexcessive muscariniceffects, vomiting, diarrhoea, bradycardia, salivation, sweating, bronchospasm, hypotension, etc. (due to toxin muscarine). Itresponds to i.v. atropine.Caused by Amanita muscariaand Psilocybe species. Toxinis muscimol. It producesmainly central effects.There is no speciﬁc antidote;atropine is contraindicated.Supportive care shouldbe given.   Caused by Amanita phalloides.Toxin is amatoxin.  It results indelayed gastroenteritis, hepaticand renal damage. It does notrespond to atropine and istreated with thioctic acid.Supportive care is required.  Mushroom poisoningRapid onset typeHallucinogen type Delayed onset type
Treatment of mushroom poisoning is mainly supportive.Arecoline.  It is an alkaloid obtained from areca nut. It has muscarinic and nicotinic actions similar to choline esters.Anticholinesterases (Fig. 2.11)They inhibit the enzyme cholinesterase that is responsible for hydrolysis of ACh.  Thus, ACh is not metabolized, gets accumulated at muscarinic and nicotinic sites  and produces cholinergic effects. Hence, anticholinesterases are called indirectly acting cholinergic drugs.Mechanism of action: ACh is rapidly hydrolysed by both true and pseudocholinester-ases. ACh binds to anionic and esteratic sites of cholinesterase n acetylated enzyme n undergoes rapid hydrolysis n acetate and free enzyme.I Carbamates bind to both the sites (i.e. anionic and esteratic) of cholinesterase (so ACh cannot bind the enzyme) n carbamoylated enzyme n undergoes slow hydrolysis to release the enzyme.

Uses 1. Glaucoma: Physostigmine reduces IOP by producing miosis, thus facilitates the drainage of aqueous humour. On chronic use, it accelerates cataract formation; hence, it is rarely used in glaucoma. 2. Atropine poisoning: Intravenous physostigmine is used for severe atropine and other antimuscarinic drug poisoning because it has both central and peripheral actions. It competitively reverses the effects of atropine poisoning, but it should be used cautiously by slow i.v. injection as it may cause bradycardia.Neostigmine (Table 2.4; see Fig. 2.13).  Neostigmine is a synthetic anticholinesterase agent. Its actions are pronounced on NMJ, gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and urinary bladder than on cardiovascular system (CVS) or eye. On skeletal muscle, it has both direct and indirect actions.Indirect Actions.  By inhibiting cholinesterases, neostigmine increases ACh concentra-tion at NMJ.Direct Actions.  Because of structural similarity with ACh (i.e. quaternary ammonium compound), neostigmine also directly stimulates NM receptors at NMJ. Thus, it im-proves muscle power in patients with myasthenia gravis.Neostigmine does not cross BBB and has no central side effects. Therefore, neostig-mine is preferred to physostigmine in myasthenia gravis. It is available for oral, s.c., i.v. and i.m. administration.Pyridostigmine.  All features are same as neostigmine. Pyridostigmine has a longer duration of action and can be given twice daily in sustained release form; hence, it is preferred to neostigmine in myasthenia gravis. Even though pyridostigmine is less  potent than neostigmine, it is better tolerated by myasthenic patients.Edrophonium.  It is a quaternary ammonium compound. On i.v. administration, it has a rapid onset but short duration of action (8–10 minutes).Uses 1. Edrophonium is used in the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. 2. It is used to differentiate myasthenic crisis from cholinergic crisis.PhysostigmineNeostigmineNatural alkaloid obtained from  Physostigma venenosumSynthetic agentTertiary amine, has good penetration through tissues, hence topically  effectiveQuaternary ammonium compound, has poor penetration, hence topically not  effectiveCrosses BBB – produces both central and peripheral effectsDoes not cross BBB, hence no central  effectsUses• Atropine poisoning• GlaucomaUses• Postoperative urinary retention and para-lytic ileus• Myasthenia gravis• Curare poisoningTable 2.4   Comparative features of physostigmine and neostigmine

572—AUTONOMIC PHARMACOLOGY 3. In curare poisoning, edrophonium is preferred because of its rapid onset of action.Adverse Effects of Anticholinesterases.  They are due to overstimulation of both musca-rinic and nicotinic receptors – increased sweating, salivation, nausea, vomiting,  abdominal cramps, bradycardia, diarrhoea, tremors and hypotension.Therapeutic Uses of Reversible Anticholinesterases 1.

The aqueous humour formed by ciliary process is drained mainly through trabecular meshwork (Fig. 2.12).Glaucoma is optic nerve damage with loss of visual function that is frequently associ-ated with raised IOP . Normal IOP varies between 10 and 20 mm Hg. Management of this disorder is almost always directed at lowering the existing IOP either by improving drainage or decreasing the formation of aqueous humour (Fig. 2.12).Acute congestive glaucoma: It is usually precipitated by mydriatics in people with narrow iridocorneal angle and shallow anterior chamber. Acute congestive glaucoma is

a medical emergency. Once the attack is controlled, treatment is surgical or laser  iridotomy.Chronic simple glaucoma: It is a genetically predisposed condition affecting the patency of trabecular meshwork. The IOP rises gradually. Pharmacotherapy is the deﬁnitive treatment in a majority of cases.Drugs for glaucoma (Table 2.5) 1. Osmotic agents: Mannitol (20%) i.v. infusion (1.5 g/kg body weight) and 50% glycerol oral (1.5 g/kg) are used. They draw ﬂuid from the eye into the circulation by osmotic effect and reduce IOP in acute congestive glaucoma. 2. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors: Acetazolamide (oral, i.v.), dorzolamide (topical) and brinzolamide (topical) are carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. They inhibit car-bonic anhydrase enzyme, decrease bicarbonate formation in ciliary epithelium and decrease the formation of aqueous humour. T opical carbonic anhydrase  inhibitors, which have a much lower risk of systemic side effects, are preferred to systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in chronic simple glaucoma. In acute con-gestive glaucoma, acetazolamide is administered intravenously and orally. 3. /H9252-Adrenergic blockers: T opical nonselective /H9252-blockers are timolol, betaxolol, levobunolol and carteolol. They decrease aqueous humour formation by blocking /H92522-receptors on ciliary epithelium. /H9252-Blockers also decrease ocular blood ﬂow. Timolol is widely used in glaucoma because (i) it lacks local anaesthetic or partial agonistic properties; (ii) it does not affect pupil size or accommodation; (iii) it has longer duration of action; (iv) it is well tolerated; (v) it is less expensive. T opical timolol is safer and highly effective. Betaxolol is a selective /H92521-blocker used in glaucoma, but it is less effective than nonselective agents.

Prostaglandins (PGs): They reduce IOP probably by facilitating uveoscleral outﬂow. T opical PGs such as latanoprost, travoprost and bimatoprost (PGF2 /H9251-analogues) are the drug of choice in open-angle glaucoma because of their longer duration of action (once a day dosing), high efﬁcacy and low incidence  of systemic toxicity. They are also useful in acute congestive glaucoma. Latanoprost is also available in combination with timolol. They usually do not cause systemic side effects but may cause ocular irritation and iris pigmentation. 5. Miotics: Pilocarpine is a tertiary amine and is well absorbed through cornea. It is used topically in the treatment of open-angle and acute congestive glaucoma. It facilitates drainage of aqueous humour and reduces IOP . 6. /H9251-Adrenergic agonists (a) Apraclonidine is used topically as an adjunct in glaucoma.

2. Myasthenia Gravis.  Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder where antibodies are produced against NM receptors of NMJ resulting in a decrease in the number of NM receptors. There is an increased incidence of myasthenia gravis in patients with thymoma. Thymectomy can induce remission in most of the cases. In myasthenia, there is marked muscular weakness varying in degree at different times. Myasthenia gravis is diagnosed by: 1. Typical signs and symptoms – weakness and easy fatigability. 2. Edrophonium test – edrophonium (2–10 mg) given slow intravenously shows dramatic improvement of symptoms in patients with myasthenia gravis but not in other muscular dystrophies; it is also useful to differentiate myasthenic crisis from cholinergic crisis. 3. Demonstration of circulating antibodies to NM receptors.Treatment.  Anticholinesterases (neostigmine, pyridostigmine and ambenonium) are effective in providing symptomatic relief. They inhibit metabolism of ACh, thus prolonging its action at the receptors. Neostigmine also directly activates the NM recep-tors. Pyridostigmine is commonly used.

60PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESLong-term use or overdose of anticholinesterases leads to cholinergic crisis (severe muscular weakness and neuromuscular paralysis due to prolonged depolarization). This may be differentiated from myasthenic crisis (severe weakness due to exacerbation of myasthenia) by injecting a small dose of edrophonium (2 mg, i.v.). If the patient shows improvement in muscle power n myasthenic crisis. If the muscular weakness deterio-rates n cholinergic crisis. Ventilator should be kept ready before injecting edrophonium as it may aggravate cholinergic crisis, which is dangerous.Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants like azathioprine or cyclophospha-mide are useful in the induction and maintenance of remission. Plasmapheresis and immune therapy may be useful in resistant cases.Note: Drugs that aggravate myasthenia (drugs that are contraindicated in myasthenia) are aminoglycoside antibiotics, d-tubocurarine (d-TC) and other neuromuscular block-ers, /H9252-blockers, ether, phenytoin, etc.3. Postoperative Urinary Retention and Paralytic Ileus (Fig. 2.13). Neostigmine is used because it increases the tone of the smooth muscle and relaxes the sphincters.4. Curare Poisoning and Reversal of Nondepolarizing Neuromuscular Blockade (see p. 74).  Edrophonium or neostigmine is used. They antagonize neuromuscular blockade by increasing the concentration of ACh at the NMJ. Prior administration of atropine is a must to block the muscarinic side effects.5. Belladonna Poisoning (see p. 67).  Physostigmine is preferred because it reverses both central and peripheral effects of atropine poisoning.6. Alzheimer’s Disease.  It is a degenerative disease of the cerebral cortex. Donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine are cerebroselective anticholinesterases. They increase  cerebral levels of ACh and have shown to produce some beneﬁt in these patients.Irreversible Anticholinesterases  PH1.51, PH1.52Organophosphorus Insecticides.  All organophosphorus (OP) compounds except echothiophate have no therapeutic applications. Echothiophate is rarely used in resis-tant cases of glaucoma. OP compounds have only toxicological importance.OP poisoning is one of the most common poisoning all over the world. Common  OP compounds are parathion, malathion, dyﬂos, etc. They irreversibly inhibit cholines-terases and cause accumulation of ACh at muscarinic and nicotinic sites.Signs and Symptoms 1. Muscarinic effects: Profuse sweating, salivation, lacrimation, increased tracheo-bronchial secretions, bronchospasm, vomiting, abdominal cramps, miosis, brady-cardia, hypotension, involuntary urination and defecation.

612—AUTONOMIC PHARMACOLOGY 2. Nicotinic effects: Twitchings, fasciculations, muscle weakness and paralysis are due to prolonged depolarization. 3. Central effects: Headache, restlessness, confusion, convulsions, coma and death are usually due to respiratory failure.Diagnosis.  OP poisoning can be diagnosed by:I History of exposureI Characteristic signs and symptomsI Estimating the cholinesterase activity in blood, which is decreasedTreatment.  General measures 1. Remove the contaminated clothes; wash skin with soap and water. 2. Gastric lavage should be continued till the returning ﬂuid is clear. 3. Airway should be maintained. 4. Artiﬁcial respiration is given, if necessary. 5. Diazepam should be used cautiously by slow i.v. injection to control convulsions.Speciﬁc Measures 1. Atropine: Atropine is the ﬁrst drug to be given in OP poisoning. Inject atropine 2 mg i.v. stat and it should be repeated every 5–10 minutes doubling the dose, if required, till the patient is fully atropinized (fully dilated, nonreactive pupils, tachycardia, etc.). Atropine should be continued for 7–10 days.Muscarinic receptorsAtropine (antagonist)OP poisoningACh (agonist)Atropine competitively blocks the muscarinic effects of OP compounds  (competitive antagonism). 2. Oximes: Atropine is not effective for reversal of neuromuscular paralysis. Neuro-muscular transmission can be improved by giving cholinesterase reactivators such as pralidoxime and obidoxime. Pralidoxime is administered intravenously slowly in a dose of 1–2 g.OximesOP compoundsDephosphorylationAnionic siteEsteratic siteAs shown above, OP compounds inactivate cholinesterases by phosphorylating esteratic site of the enzyme. Oximes bind with high afﬁnity to anionic site, react with phosphorus atom of the OP compound, dephosphorylate the enzyme, and reactivate it. Early administration of oximes is necessary before the phosphorylated enzyme under-goes ‘aging’ (loses alkyl groups) and becomes resistant to reactivation.Oximes are not effective in carbamate poisoning; they also have mild anti-ChE  activityDelayed toxicity of organophosphates: Prolonged exposure to OP compounds can cause neurotoxicity.

Atropine and scopolamine are belladonna alkaloids. Atro-pine is obtained from Atropa belladonna and scopolamine from Hyoscyamus niger.Mechanism of Action.  Both natural and synthetic drugs competitively block the muscarinic effects of ACh (competitive antagonism).Acetylcholine(agonist)Muscarinic receptorsAtropine and scopolamine(antagonists)Classiﬁcation of Antimuscarinic Agents 1. Natural alkaloids (Belladonna alkaloids): Atropine, scopolamine (hyoscine). 2. Semisynthetic derivatives:Hyoscine butyl bromideHomatropine (mydriatic)Ipratropium bromide, tiotropium bromide (bronchial asthma) 3. Synthetic antimuscarinic agents: (a) Used as mydriatic – cyclopentolate, tropicamide (b) Used in peptic ulcer – pirenzepine, telenzepine, clidinium, propantheline (c) Used as antispasmodic – dicyclomine, valethamate, ﬂavoxate, oxybutynin,  tolterodine, darifenacin (d) Used as preanaesthetic agent – glycopyrrolate (e) Used in parkinsonism – benzhexol (trihexyphenidyl), benztropine, biperiden, procyclidineAtropine.  Atropine is the prototype drug and the chief alkaloid of belladonna. It is a tertiary amine. It blocks actions of ACh on all the muscarinic receptors. Atropine is administered by topical (eye), oral and parenteral routes.

632—AUTONOMIC PHARMACOLOGY
Pharmacological Actions of Atropine (Fig. 2.14) 1. CNS: In therapeutic doses, atropine has mild CNS stimulant effect. It produces antiparkinsonian effect by reducing cholinergic overactivity in basal ganglia. It suppresses vestibular disturbances and produces antimotion sickness effect. Large doses can produce excitement, restlessness, agitation, hallucinations, medullary paralysis, coma and death. 2. CVS: At low doses, atropine causes initial bradycardia due to blockade of presyn-aptic muscarinic autoreceptors (M1) on vagal nerve endings. In therapeutic doses, tachycardia is seen due to blockade of M2 receptors of the heart; it also improves A–V conduction. In high doses, ﬂushing of the face and hypotension may occur due to cutaneous vasodilatation. 3. Glands: All secretions under cholinergic inﬂuence are reduced due to blockade of M3 receptors, i.e. sweat, salivary, nasal, throat, bronchial, gastric, lacrimal, etc. Milk and bile secretions are not affected. The skin and mucous membranes become dry.Fig. 2.14 Actions of atropine.

Eye: Effects of atropine on eye are depicted as follows (also see Table 2.6):AtropineParalysis of constrictor pupillae(blockade of M3 receptors)Paralysis of ciliary muscle leading to loss ofaccommodation (blockade of M3 receptors)Passive mydriasisCycloplegiaEffects on eye last for 7–10 days following topical administration of atropine. 5. Smooth muscles: (a) GIT: Atropine decreases tone and motility of the gut, but increases sphincter tone and may cause constipation. It also relaxes smooth muscle of the gall  bladder. (b) Urinary bladder: Atropine relaxes detrusor muscle of the bladder, but increases the tone of trigone and sphincter – may cause urinary retention, especially in elderly men with enlarged prostate. (c) Bronchi: Atropine relaxes the bronchial smooth muscle. It also reduces secretion and mucociliary clearance resulting in mucus plug that may block  the airway.Pharmacokinetics.  Atropine, scopolamine and most of the synthetic tertiary amines are well absorbed from the conjunctiva and GI tract; are widely distributed all over the body; cross BBB; partly metabolized in liver and partly excreted unchanged in urine.Atropine Substitutes: Atropine acts on all subtypes of muscarinic receptors.  Atropine substitutes have selective or relatively selective action on a particular organ, hence pro-duce less adverse effects than atropine.AtropinePhenylephrine/ephedrine 1. It is an anticholinergic agent – causes passive mydriasis 1. It is a sympathomimetic agent – causes active mydriasis due to contraction of radial muscle ﬁbres of the iris 2. There is loss of accommodation (it is cy-cloplegic), photophobia and blurring of vision; cycloplegia is due to paralysis of ciliary muscle; the lens becomes ﬂat and vision is ﬁxed for distant objects. 2. It does not cause cycloplegia 3. There is loss of light reﬂex 3. There is no loss of light reﬂex 4. IOP may rise and acute congestive glau-coma may be precipitated in person  with shallow anterior chamber; it causes mydriasis and relaxation of ciliary muscle which occlude the canal of Schlemm, resulting in obstruction to the ﬂow of aqueous humour 4. IOP is reduced due to a decrease in the formation of aqueous humourTable 2.6   Effects of atropine and phenylephrine/ephedrine on eye

Antispasmodics (a) DicyclomineI T ertiary amineI Has antispasmodic and antiemetic propertiesI Useful in dysmenorrhoea and abdominal colic (b) ValethamateI T ertiary amineI Has antispasmodic effectI Useful in intestinal and urinary colic (c) OxybutyninI Has selective action at M1 and M3 receptors in urinary bladder and salivary gland.I Has vasicoselective action – useful for relief of spasm after urologic surgeries, for increasing bladder capacity in paraplegics and in nocturnal enuresis. (d) TolterodineI More selective for urinary bladder than salivary glands, hence dryness of mouth is less.I Used to decrease frequency and urgency in detrusor overactivity. (e) FlavoxateI Similar to oxybutyninI Used to relieve urgency and frequency due to cystitis, prostatitis or urethritis (f) Darifenacin, SolifenacinI Have selective action on urinary bladder (M3) – useful for relief of spasm after urologic surgeries and urinary incontinence.I Are longer acting than oxybutynin.I Oxybutynin, ﬂavoxate, tolterodine, darifenacin and solifenacin are vasicose-lective anticholinergics.DrotaverineI Not an anticholinergic agentI Inhibits phosphodiesterase enzymeI Used as antispasmodic for relief of uterine spasm, intestinal and renal colic 3.

66PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES 4. PirenzepineI Has selective action on gastric acid secretion (M1) – useful in peptic ulcer.I Anticholinergic side effects – dryness of mouth, constipation, tachycardia and urinary retention are rare. 5. Benzhexol and benztropineI They are centrally acting anticholinergic agents used in parkinsonism. 6. GlycopyrrolateI Quaternary compound – central side effects are rare.I Used for preanaesthetic medication. 7. PropanthelineI Useful in peptic ulcer and as an antispasmodic.I Rarely used at present. 8.

Hyoscine butylbromideI Quaternary compound; available for oral and parenteral administration.I Used as antispasmodic for relief of oesophageal and GI colics.Therapeutic Uses of Atropine and Its Substitutes 1. Ophthalmic uses:I As mydriatic and cycloplegic – for refraction testing. Atropine, homatropine, cyclopentolate or tropicamide are used topically. The action of atropine lasts for 7–10 days. Tropicamide is the preferred mydriatic as it has a short duration of action. In children, atropine is preferred because of its greater efficacy.I As mydriatic – for funduscopic examination, short-acting agent is used.I In iridocyclitis – atropinic mydriatics are used alternatively with miotics to break or prevent adhesions between iris and lens. 2. As preanaesthetic medication: Atropine or glycopyrrolate is used. They are used prior to the administration of general anaesthetics:I T o prevent vagal bradycardia during anaesthesia.I T o prevent laryngospasm by decreasing respiratory secretions.Glycopyrrolate is a quaternary ammonium compound and has only peripheral anticholinergic effects. 3. Sialorrhoea: Synthetic derivatives (glycopyrrolate) are used to decrease excessive salivary secretion, e.g. in heavy metal poisoning and parkinsonism. 4 . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchial asthma: I p r a t r o-pium bromide and tiotropium bromide are used in COPD and bronchial asthma. They are administered by metered dose inhaler or nebulizer. They produce bronchodilatation without affecting mucociliary clearance, hence are preferred to atropine. 5. Anticholinergics are useful as antispasmodic in dysmenorrhoea, intestinal and renal colic. They are less effective in biliary colic. 6. Urinary disorders: Oxybutynin and ﬂavoxate have more prominent effect on bladder smooth muscle, hence are used to relieve spasm after urologic surgery. T olterodine has selective action on bladder smooth muscle (M3), hence is used to relieve urinary incontinence. 7. Poisoning:I In OP poisoning, atropine is the life-saving drug (see p. 61).

672—AUTONOMIC PHARMACOLOGYI In some types of mushroom poisoning (Inocybe species), atropine is the drug of choice (see p. 54).I Atropine is used in curare poisoning with neostigmine to counteract the mus-carinic effects of neostigmine. 8. As vagolytic: Atropine is used to treat sinus bradycardia and partial heart block due to increased vagal activity. It improves A–V conduction by vagolytic effect. 9. Parkinsonism: Centrally acting anticholinergic drugs such as benzhexol (trihexy-phenidyl), benztropine, biperiden, procyclidine, etc. are the preferred agents for prevention and treatment of drug-induced parkinsonism. They are also useful in idiopathic parkinsonism, but less effective than levodopa. They control tremor and rigidity of parkinsonism.Adverse Effects and Contraindications.  The adverse effects of atropine are due to the extension of its pharmacological actions. 1. GIT: Dryness of mouth and throat, difﬁculty in swallowing, constipation, etc. 2. Eye: Photophobia, headache, blurring of vision; in elderly persons with shallow anterior chamber, they may precipitate acute congestive glaucoma. Hence, anti-cholinergics are contraindicated in glaucoma. 3. Urinary tract: Difﬁculty in micturition and urinary retention especially in elderly men with enlarged prostate. So, they are contraindicated in these patients. 4. CNS: Large doses produce restlessness, excitement, delirium and hallucinations. 5. CVS: Tachycardia, palpitation and hypotension. 6. Acute belladonna poisoning: It is more common in children. The presenting features include fever, dry and ﬂushed skin, photophobia, blurring of vision,  difﬁculty in micturition, restlessness, excitement, confusion, disorientation and hallucinations.Severe poisoning may cause respiratory depression, cardiovascular collapse, convulsions, coma and death.Treatment of belladonna poisoning (Atropine poisoning): It is mainly symptomatic. 1. Hospitalization. 2. Gastric lavage with tannic acid in case poison was ingested. 3. Tepid sponging to control hyperpyrexia. 4. Diazepam to control convulsions. 5. The antidote for severe atropine poisoning is physostigmine (1–4 mg). It is injected intravenously slowly. It is a tertiary amine – counteracts both periph-eral and central effects of atropine poisoning. Hence, physostigmine is pre-ferred to neostigmine.Scopolamine.  Scopolamine (hyoscine), another belladonna alkaloid, produces all the actions of atropine. In therapeutic doses, it produces prominent CNS depression with sedation and amnesia. Scopolamine has shorter duration of action than atro-pine. It has more prominent actions on eye and secretory glands. By blocking  cholinergic activity, scopolamine suppresses vestibular disturbances and prevents motion sickness (Fig. 2.15). It is the drug of choice for motion sickness – can be administered orally or as a transdermal patch. It is more effective for prevention of motion sickness, hence should be given (0.2 mg oral) at least half an hour before journey. The patch is placed behind the ear over the mastoid process. The patch should be applied at least 4–5 hours before the journey, and its effect lasts 72 hours. Scopolamine causes sedation and dryness of mouth. It can be administered paren-terally as a preanaesthetic agent.

H1-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), phe-nothiazines, etc. have atropine-like action, hence may potentiate anticholinergic side effects.Atropine alters absorption of some drugs by delaying gastric emptying – the bioavail-ability of levodopa is reduced, whereas the absorption of tetracyclines and digoxin is enhanced due to increased GI transit time.Ganglion BlockersThey act at NN receptors of the autonomic ganglia (block both parasympathetic and sympathetic ganglia) and produce widespread complex effects (Fig. 2.16). The ganglion blockers have ‘atropine-like’ action on heart (palpitation and tachycardia), eyes (my-driasis and cycloplegia), GIT (dryness of mouth and constipation), bladder (urinary retention). They decrease sweat secretion and cause impotence in males. Blockade of sympathetic ganglia results in marked postural hypotension.No selective ganglion blockers are available till now. Hence, they are rarely used in therapy.Trimethaphan is a short-acting ganglion blocker that must be given by i.v. infusion. At present, the only use of trimethaphan is to produce controlled hypotension during  neurosurgery.Nicotine is obtained from tobacco leaves. It has initial stimulating, later a prolonged blocking effect on the autonomic ganglia. T obacco smoking and chewing is a serious risk factor for oral, lung, heart and other diseases.Treatment of nicotine addictionNicotine chewing gum and transdermal patch: They are useful as nicotine replacement therapy.Bupropion: It inhibits NA and DA reuptake and is used for smoking cessation.V arenicline: It is a partial agonist at nicotinic receptors. It decreases craving and with-drawal symptoms during smoking cessation.

All of them cause certain degree of sedation. They act by depressing polysynaptic pathways in spinal and supra-spinal sites. They are used to reduce spasm associated with cerebral palsy, trauma, sprain, tetanus, multiple sclerosis, etc. (Table 2.7 for characteristics of these drugs).Neuromuscular BlockersUnlike centrally acting skeletal muscle relaxants, these drugs interfere with neuromus-cular transmission, do not affect CNS and are administered intravenously. Neuromus-cular blockers include nondepolarizing (competitive) and depolarizing blockers.Depolarizing Blockers: Succinylcholine (Suxamethonium).  Succinylcholine (SCh) is a quaternary ammonium compound. The structure resembles two molecules of ACh linked together. It acts as a partial agonist at NM receptors, hence causes initial fascicula-tions and later ﬂaccid paralysis due to prolonged depolarization (phase I block). With continued exposure to the drug, the membrane becomes desensitized that leads to phase II block, which resembles the nondepolarizing block and is partially reversed by anti-cholinesterases. Phase II block can occur in patients with atypical pseudocholinesterase.SCh is rapidly hydrolysed by pseudocholinesterase, hence has a very short duration of action (3–8 minutes). Transient apnoea is usually seen at the peak of its action.  

712—AUTONOMIC PHARMACOLOGYIn people with liver disease or atypical pseudocholinesterase due to genetic defect, the metabolism of SCh becomes slow which results in severe neuromuscular blockade  leading to respiratory paralysis with prolonged apnoea. This is referred to as ‘prolonged succinylcholine apnoea’. There is no antidote available, therefore:I Fresh frozen plasma should be infused.I Patient should be ventilated artiﬁcially until full recovery.Adverse Effects 1. Muscle pain is due to initial fasciculations (muscle soreness). 2. Increased IOP due to contraction of external ocular muscles and it lasts for few minutes. 3. Aspiration of gastric contents may occur due to increased intragastric pressure. 4. Hyperkalaemia – fasciculations release K/H11001 into the blood. 5. Sinus bradycardia is due to vagal stimulation. 6. SCh apnoea (prolonged apnoea). 7. Malignant hyperthermia especially when used with halothane in genetically sus-ceptible individuals. This is treated with intravenous dantrolene, rapid cooling, inhalation of 100% oxygen and control of acidosis.Competitive Blockers (Nondepolarizing Blockers; Table 2.8).  Claude Bernard showed experimentally the site of action of curare. Curare is a mixture of alkaloids and was used as an arrow poison. Among them, d-TC is the most important alkaloid which has  NM blocking activity. d-TC is the prototype drug of competitive blockers.Mechanism of Action.  ACh is the agonist, whereas d-TC is the antagonist at NM receptors. Curariform drugs competitively antagonize the actions of ACh at the NM receptors of the NMJ. Anticholinesterases (neostigmine or edrophonium) are used to reverse the effects of competitive blockers by increasing the concentration of ACh.ACh(agonist)NMreceptors(NMJ)d-TC(antagonist)Actions.  Competitive blockers produce ﬂaccid paralysis. The order of muscles affected is extrinsic eye muscles–neck (muscles of phonation and swallowing)–face–hands–feet–limbs–trunk and ﬁnally, the respiratory muscles (intercostal muscles and diaphragm). But recovery occurs in reverse order – the respiratory muscles are the ﬁrst to recover. Consciousness and appreciation of pain are not affected.I d-TC, mivacurium and atracurium cause histamine release which can manifest as hypotension, bronchospasm, etc.I Pancuronium, vecuronium, doxacurium and rocuronium have minimal/no ten-dency to cause histamine release.I Vecuronium, doxacurium and rocuronium have minimal tendency to cause cardiovascular effects like hypotension, cardiovascular collapse, etc. These effects are also less marked with pancuronium and pipecuronium. Cardiovascular side effects are prominent with d-TC and mivacurium.I Among competitive neuromuscular blockers, rocuronium has a rapid onset of action; hence, it can be used for endotracheal intubation.I Comparative features of d-TC and SCh are shown in Table 2.9.Pharmacokinetics.  Neuromuscular blockers are quaternary ammonium compounds. They are highly ionized, hence poorly absorbed from GI tract. They are administered

The adverse effects of nondepolarizing drugs are hypotension, respi-ratory paralysis, bronchospasm and aspiration of gastric contents.Drug Interactions of Skeletal Muscle Relaxants 1. Nondepolarizing blockers /H11003 antibioticsAminoglycosides inhibit the release of ACh from motor nerve and potentiate the effect of nondepolarizing blockers, hence require dose reduction in patients treated with aminoglycosides. Tetracyclines and clindamycin also potentiate the effect of nondepolarizing blockers. 2. Thiazides/loop diuretics /H11003 nondepolarizing blockersHypokalaemia caused by thiazides/loop diuretics may potentiate the effect of nondepolarizing blockers. 3. SCh /H11003 thiopentoneThese drugs are chemically incompatible (in vitro; pharmaceutical interaction) hence result in precipitation when mixed in the same syringe. 4. General anaesthetics /H11003 nondepolarizing blockersEther has curarimimetic effect on skeletal muscle, hence enhances the effect of nondepolarizing blockers. Fluorinated anaesthetics (isoﬂurane, desﬂurane and sevoﬂurane) also produce similar effect but to a lesser extent.Factors Affecting Action of Neuromuscular Blockers 1. pH changes: Metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis increase the duration of block. 2. Hypothermia: It potentiates neuromuscular block by delaying the metabolism and elimination of these drugs. 3. Myasthenia gravis: Myasthenic patients are highly sensitive to competitive neuro-muscular blockers.d-TCSuccinylcholine 1. Natural alkaloid 1. Synthetic 2. Nondepolarizing blocker 2.

74PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES 4. Aminoglycoside antibiotics: They potentiate the effect of both competitive and nondepolarizing blockers by inhibiting presynaptic release of ACh. 5. Inhalational anaesthetics: Anaesthetics like halothane, isoﬂurane and ketamine increase the effects of neuromuscular blocking agents.Uses 1. The main use of neuromuscular blockers is as adjuvant to general anaesthetics for producing satisfactory skeletal muscle relaxation during surgical procedures in abdomen and thorax, orthopaedics, etc. SCh is preferred for short procedures, e.g. diagnostic endoscopies, endotracheal intubation and orthopaedic manipulations. Vecuronium is commonly used in routine surgeries. Pancuronium and pipe-curonium are used in surgeries of long duration. 2. SCh /mivacurium is used during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to prevent trauma due to convulsions. 3. For tetanus and status epilepticus when not controlled by other drugs, competitive neuromuscular blockers can be used. 4. Competitive neuromuscular blockers, e.g. vecuronium, can be used for ventilatory support in critically ill patients.Reversal of Neuromuscular Blockade.  Edrophonium or neostigmine by increasing the concentration of ACh reverses the effect of d-TC and other competitive blockers at NMJ. Use of prior atropine administration is necessary to block the muscarinic effects of anti-cholinesterases (Fig. 2.17). Mivacurium (short acting), atracurium (intermediate acting), etc. do not require reversal.Sugammadex.  It is administered intravenously for rapid reversal of neuromuscular blocking action of rocuronium and vecuronium. It encapsulates the drugs, thus pre-venting their action.Directly Acting Skeletal Muscle Relaxant: Dantrolene.  Dantrolene is a directly acting skeletal muscle relaxant. It inhibits depolarization-induced Ca2/H11001 release (by blocking ry-anodine receptors) from sarcoplasmic reticulum and produces skeletal muscle relaxation. Intravenous dantrolene is the life-saving drug in malignant hyperthermia. It is used orally to reduce spasm in multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, spinal injuries, etc. The side effects are drowsiness, diarrhoea, dizziness, headache, fatigue and rarely hepatotoxicity.Botulinum Toxin A.  It is obtained from Clostridium botulinum, a gram-positive anaero-bic bacterium. The toxin prevents release of ACh into the synaptic cleft by inhibiting proteins necessary for the release of ACh. Thus, it normalizes the tone in hyperreactive or spastic muscles when given locally. It is given intradermally for antiwrinkle effect in cos-metic procedures and into the muscle in multiple doses for spasticity or dystonia. Botu-linum toxin A is injected under ultrasound guidance into salivary glands in sialorrhoea

Adverse effects are pain at the site of injection, muscle paralysis, myalgia and occasionally rashes.Adrenergic Agonists (Sympathomimetic Agents)  PH1.13Adrenergic agonists mimic the actions of sympathetic stimulation.Adrenergic TransmissionThe transmitter in the sympathetic system is noradrenaline (NA; norepinephrine). Nerves that synthesize, store and release NA are called adrenergic (sympathetic) nerves.Synthesis of catecholamines begins with the amino acid tyrosine, which is trans-ported into the adrenergic neuron by active transport. In the neuronal cytosol, tyrosine is converted to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) by tyrosine hydroxylase and DOPA  to dopamine (DA) by dopa decarboxylase. DA enters storage vesicles of the nerve termi-nal by active transport, where it is converted to NA by the enzyme dopamine  /H9252-hydroxylase (this enzyme is present only in the storage vesicles); NA formed gets stored in the vesicles. In the adrenal medulla, NA is further converted to adrenaline by N-methyltransferase. Small quantities of NA are released continuously into the synaptic cleft and large quantities during nerve stimulation (Fig. 2.18).

Three processes are involved in termination of action of released NA in the synaptic cleft (fate of released NA in the synaptic cleft): 1 .  Most of the released NA is taken back into adrenergic nerve terminals (neuronal reup-take), which is either stored in vesicles or inactivated by mitochondrial monoamine oxidase (MAO) in the cytosol. Neuronal reuptake is the most important mechanism through which termination of action of NA takes place in the synaptic cleft. 2. Small amount of NA from the synaptic cleft diffuses into circulation and gets inactivated in liver by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and MAO. 3. Small quantity of NA is transported into other tissues (extraneuronal uptake).

772—AUTONOMIC PHARMACOLOGYMetabolism of CatecholaminesVanillylmandelic acid (VMA) is the main metabolite of catecholamines excreted in urine. Normal value of VMA is 4–8 mg per 24 hours urine. Its levels are raised in pheo-chromocytoma, a tumour of adrenal medulla and sympathetic ganglia. Estimation of the levels of catecholamines and their metabolites in blood and urine is of great value in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. CT (computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan are the important diagnostic aids.AdrenalineNoradrenalineCOMT and MAO•Vanillyl mandelic acid (VMA)•Metanephrine•NormetanephrineTypes, Distribution and Functions of Adrenergic ReceptorsAhlquist divided adrenergic receptors into /H9251 and /H9252 types, which are located on the cell membrane. All adrenergic receptors are G-protein coupled receptors and regulate the production of intracellular second messengers; increase in IP3/DAG (/H92511), gcAMP (/H92512)and hcAMP (/H9252).

812—AUTONOMIC PHARMACOLOGYDirect-Acting SympathomimeticsAdrenaline (Epinephrine): /H92511-, /H92512-, /H92521-, /H92522- and /H92523-Agonist.  It is a catecholamine, which is secreted mainly by adrenal medulla. Adrenaline is a direct-acting, nonselective  adrenergic agonist.Pharmacological Actions.  Adrenaline acts on /H92511-, /H92512-, /H92521-, /H92522- and /H92523-receptors. 1. Cardiovascular system (a) Heart: Adrenaline is a powerful cardiac stimulant. It acts mainly by interact-ing with /H92521-receptors and produces various effects. They are as follows:I Increase in heart rate – h rate of spontaneous depolarization in SA node (positive chronotropic effect)I Increase in myocardial contractility (positive inotropic effect)I Increase in conduction velocity (positive dromotropic effect)I Increase in cardiac outputI Increase in automaticityI Cardiac work and its oxygen requirement is markedly increasedI Increase in the excitability and tendency to cause cardiac arrhythmias (b) Blood vessels and BP: Blood vessels of the skin and mucous membranes (/H92511-receptors) are constricted by adrenaline. It also constricts renal, mesen-teric, pulmonary and splanchnic vessels, but dilates blood vessels of skeletal muscle and coronary vessels (/H92522). Intravenous administration of adrenaline in moderate doses produces biphasic effect. There is an initial rise in BP due to  /H92511 (blood vessels) and /H92521 (heart) actions, followed by a fall in BP due to /H92522-mediated dilatation of blood vessels in skeletal muscle. Administration of adrenaline after /H9251-blocker produces only a fall in BP (/H92522-action). This is referred to as vasomotor reversal of Dale (Fig. 2.21).If adrenaline is rapidly injected intravenously, there is an increase in both systolic and diastolic BP . 2. Respiratory system: Adrenaline rapidly relaxes (/H92522) bronchial smooth muscle. It is a potent bronchodilator but has a short duration of action. It inhibits the release of inﬂammatory mediators from mast cells (/H92522). It also reduces secretions and relieves mucosal congestion by vasoconstrictor effect (/H92511). 3. GIT: It relaxes the smooth muscle of the gut (/H9251 and /H92522). It reduces the intestinal tone and peristaltic movements but the effects are transient. 4. Bladder: It relaxes the detrusor muscle (/H92522) and contracts the sphincter (/H92511). As a result, it may cause difﬁculty in urination.

82PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES 5 .  CNS: In therapeutic doses, adrenaline does not cross BBB; hence, CNS effects are minimal. But in high doses, it may cause headache, restlessness and tremor. 6. Eye: Adrenaline has poor penetration through cornea when applied topically into the eye. Hence, it is administered as a prodrug (see p. 59). 7. Metabolic effects:I Adrenaline increases blood glucose level by: (i) Stimulating hepatic glycogenolysis (/H92522), which is the predominant effect. (ii) Reducing insulin secretion through /H92512-action. (iii) Decreasing uptake of glucose by peripheral tissues.I It increases blood lactic acid level by stimulating glycogenolysis in skeletal muscles. 8. Other effectsI Adrenaline facilitates neuromuscular transmission and postpones fatigue.I It reduces plasma K/H11001 levels by promoting uptake of K/H11001 into cells, particularly into the skeletal muscle (/H92522).Pharmacokinetics.  Adrenaline is not suitable for oral administration because of its rapid inactivation in the GI mucosa and liver. Adrenaline can be given subcutaneously. In anaphylactic shock, absorption of s.c. adrenaline is poor; hence, it is given intramus-cularly. In cardiac arrest, it is given intravenously. It does not cross BBB; is rapidly metabolized by COMT and MAO, and the metabolites are excreted in urine.Adverse Effects and Contraindications.  The adverse effects of adrenaline are an ex-tension of its pharmacological actions. They are tachycardia, palpitation, headache, restlessness, tremors and rise in BP . The serious side effects are cerebral haemorrhage and cardiac arrhythmias. In high concentration, adrenaline may cause acute pulmo-nary oedema due to shift of blood from systemic to pulmonary circulation. Adrena-line is contraindicated in most of the cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, angina, cardiac arrhythmias and congestive cardiac failure (CCF). In patients on  /H9252-blockers, it may cause hypertensive crisis and cerebral haemorrhage due to unop-posed action on vascular /H92511-receptors.Therapeutic Uses of Adrenaline (ABCDE) 1 .  Anaphylactic shock: Adrenaline is the life-saving drug in anaphylactic shock. Adrenaline 0.3–0.5 mL of 1:1000 solution (1 mg/mL) is administered intramus-cularly. It rapidly reverses the manifestations of severe allergic reactions. The beneﬁcial effect of adrenaline in anaphylactic shock is shown below. Adrenaline produces the following effects:I  β1-mediated cardiac stimulation (↑ heart rate and ↑force of contraction)       +    α1-mediated vasoconstriction       ↑peripheral resistance.These actions help to ↑BP.I  α1-mediated vasoconstriction       ↓mucosal oedema (↓laryngeal oedema).I  β2 stimulation       bronchodilation↓release of mediators from mast cells.I  It is physiological antagonist of histamine.  2 .  Cardiac resuscitation: In the treatment of cardiac arrest due to drowning or electro-cution, adrenaline is injected intravenously in 1:10,000 (0.1 mg/mL) concentration along with other supportive measures such as external cardiac massage.

832—AUTONOMIC PHARMACOLOGY
 3. Prolongs the Duration of local anaesthesia: Adrenaline (1:100,000) with ligno-caine. Adrenaline, by its vasoconstrictor effect (/H92511) delays absorption of the local anaesthetic and prolongs the duration of local anaesthesia. 4. Controls Epistaxis and other capillary oozing: Adrenaline is used as a local haemo-static to control bleeding following tooth extraction and during surgical proce-dures in nose, throat, larynx, etc. because of its vasoconstrictor effect. 5. Glaucoma: Adrenaline has poor penetration when applied locally into the eye; hence, it is administered as a prodrug, dipivefrin (p. 59). 6 .  Bronchial asthma: Adrenaline is a powerful bronchodilator and has rapid onset but short duration of action. It is rarely used for acute asthma. Its use has de-clined because of its dangerous cardiac stimulant effect. The beneﬁcial effects  of adrenaline in bronchial asthma are shown in Fig. 2.22. Adrenaline 0.3–0.5 mL of 1:1000 solution is given subcutaneously. It can be given by nebulization (as inhalation).Noradrenaline: /H92511-, /H92512- and /H92521-Agonist.  Noradrenaline is a catecholamine. It is the neu-rotransmitter in adrenergic system. It acts on /H92511-, /H92512- and /H92521-adrenergic receptors and has negligible /H92522-action. The main action of NA is on CVS. It has a direct cardiac stimulant effect (/H92521), constricts all the blood vessels (/H92511) including those of skin, mu-cous membrane, renal, mesenteric, pulmonary, skeletal muscle, etc. The systolic, dia-stolic and pulse pressure are increased. There is reﬂex bradycardia. Noradrenaline, like adrenaline, is not effective orally. It is not suitable for s.c., i.m. or direct i.v. injection because of necrosis and sloughing of the tissues at the site of injection. It is administered by i.v. infusion. It can be used to raise BP in hypotensive states but it may decrease blood ﬂow to vital organs by causing widespread vasoconstriction.Isoprenaline (Isoproterenol): /H92521-/H92522 and /H92523-Agonist.  It is a synthetic, nonselective /H9252-receptor agonist with a catechol nucleus. It has potent /H9252-actions but no action at /H9251-receptors. Isoprenaline is a powerful cardiac stimulant. It has positive inotropic, chronotropic and dromotropic effects. It dilates renal, mesenteric and skeletal muscle blood vessels. Systolic BP is minimally changed but the diastolic and mean arterial pressure are reduced. It relaxes bronchial and GI smooth muscles. Isoprenaline is not effective orally because of extensive ﬁrst-pass metabolism. It can be given parenterally or as an aerosol. It is metabolized by COMT. Isoprenaline is used to increase the heart Fig. 2.22 Effects of adrenaline in bronchial asthma.

Side effects are tachycardia, palpitation, cardiac arrhythmias, etc. due to its powerful cardiac stimulant effect.Dobutamine: Relatively Selective /H92521-Agonist.  Dobutamine, a synthetic catecholamine, structurally resembles DA. It acts on /H92521-, /H92522- and /H92511-receptors. It does not act on dopaminergic (D1 and D2) receptors. It is a potent inotropic agent but causes only slight increase in heart rate. T otal peripheral resistance is not signiﬁcantly affected. This is because vasoconstriction (/H92511-mediated) is balanced by vasodilatation (/H92522-mediated). It is administered by i.v. infusion in patients with acute heart failure. The side effects are tachycardia (at high doses), rise in BP and tolerance, which can be avoided by intermit-tent therapy.Salbutamol, Terbutaline, Salmeterol, Formoterol: Selective /H92522-Adrenergic Agonists.  Selective /H92522-agonists are the main drugs used in bronchial asthma, e.g. salbutamol, levalbuterol, pirbuterol, terbutaline, salmeterol and formoterol. Nonselective /H9252-agonist like adrenaline is rarely used because of its cardiac side effects.Pharmacological Actions.  Pharmacological actions of selective /H92522-agonists are depicted in Fig. 2.23. They cause bronchodilatation, relaxation of pregnant uterus, dilata-tion of blood vessels supplying the skeletal muscle, promote hepatic glycogenolysis and uptake of K/H11001 into cells.Therapeutic Uses 1. Bronchial asthma: Selective /H92522-agonists are usually administered by aerosol. They produce prompt bronchodilatation (salbutamol, terbutaline and formoterol) with minimal systemic side effects. 2. Premature labour: On oral or parenteral administration, salbutamol and terbuta-line relax pregnant uterus by interacting with /H92522-receptors, hence are used to delay premature labour. 3. Hyperkalaemia: Selective /H92522-agonists are useful in hyperkalaemia as they promote uptake of K/H11001 into cells, especially into skeletal muscles.Isoxsuprine.  It relaxes smooth muscles of uterus and blood vessel by acting on /H92522-receptors. It can be used in dysmenorrhoea, threatened abortion and to delay prema-ture labour. It is available for oral, i.m. and i.v. administration.Ritodrine: Selective /H92522-Agonist with Main Action on Uterus.  Ritodrine is a /H92522-agonist with selective action on uterus. It is used as a uterine relaxant to suppress premature  labour.

852—AUTONOMIC PHARMACOLOGYAdverse Effects of Selective /H92522-Agonists 1. Tremor is due to stimulation of /H92522-receptors of skeletal muscle. T olerance develops to this effect on continued administration. 2. Tachycardia and palpitation are due to stimulation of /H92521-receptors of heart (/H92522-selectivity is not absolute – may cause cardiac side effects). 3. Hyperglycaemia may occur in diabetes patients following parenteral administra-tion of /H92522-agonists. 4. Hypokalaemia is due to shift of K/H11001into cells.Phenylephrine, Methoxamine, Mephentermine: Selective /H92511-Adrenergic Agonists• Phenylephrine• Methoxamine• M e p h e n t e r m i n eCause vasoconstrictionIncrease peripheralvascular resistance (PVR)Increase in BPDirectly acting α1 agonists– Directly acting α1 agonist  releases NA (indirect action)
Like ephedrine, mephentermine also has cardiac stimulant effect. They are used paren-terally to raise the BP in hypotensive states. Phenylephrine is also used topically as a mydriatic and as a nasal decongestant.Nasal Decongestants.  The commonly used /H9251-agonists as nasal decongestants are naphazo-line, oxymetazoline and xylometazoline (topical); pseudoephedrine (oral) and phenyleph-rine (oral and topical). They are used in allergic rhinitis, common cold, sinusitis, etc. These drugs stimulate /H9251-receptors and cause vasoconstriction in the nasal mucous membrane, thus relieve nasal congestion. On prolonged use, they cause rebound congestion (after conges-tion). Atrophic rhinitis, anosmia and local irritation are the other adverse effects seen with topical decongestants. If systemically absorbed, these drugs may aggravate hypertension.Pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine are the commonly used oral preparations. These drugs cause less rebound phenomenon, but systemic side effects like hypertension and CNS stimulation are common. They should not be combined with MAO inhibitors be-cause of risk of hypertensive crisis, which could be fatal. Phenylpropanolamine was used as a nasal decongestant. It has been banned because of increased incidence of stroke.Selective /H92512-Adrenergic Agonists.  They include clonidine, /H9251-methyldopa (see p. 106–107) and tizanidine (see p. 70, Table 2.7).Apraclonidine and brimonidine, selective /H92512-agonists, are used topically in glaucoma (see p. 59).Indirect-Acting Sympathomimetic AgentsAmphetamine.  Amphetamine is an indirectly acting sympathomimetic agent and has a potent CNS stimulant effect. It occurs in two isomers. The d-isomer has more potent CNS effects and l-isomer on CVS.

86PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESPharmacological ActionsIn therapeutic doses – insomnia alertness, euphoria, increased motor and physical activity, tremor, restlessness, confusion, headache, etc.• On chronic use –  fatigue, depression, and impairs performance• Suppresses appetite, (tolerance develops on chronic use)CNSstimulantAmphetamineCardiac stimulant –tachycardia, palpitation, rise in BP and cardiac arrhythmiasAdverse Effects.  Adverse effects are due to the extension of its pharmacological actions. They are restlessness, insomnia, confusion, fatigue, tremor, hallucinations and suicidal tendencies. The cardiac side effects are tachycardia, palpitation, hypertension, angina and cardiac arrhythmias.Treatment of Acute Intoxication 1. Acidiﬁcation of urine with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) promotes the excretion of amphetamine, which is a basic drug. 2. Sedatives are effective to control CNS symptoms and sodium nitroprusside for hypertension.Uses 1 .  Narcolepsy: It is a sleep disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of uncontrol-lable desire for sleep. Amphetamine improves narcolepsy by its CNS stimulant effect. 2. As an anorexiant: Amphetamine-like drugs reduce body weight by suppressing hypothalamic feeding centre. T olerance to this effect develops rapidly. 3 .  Attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder: Amphetamine acts paradoxically and con-trols the activity in children with hyperactivity disorder. The main adverse effects are loss of appetite and insomnia. Methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine and atomox-etine (selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor) are also useful in this disorder.Modaﬁnil.  It is a CNS stimulant – useful in narcolepsy. Side effects and risk of depen-dence is lower than amphetamine.Mixed Acting Sympathomimetic AgentsEphedrine: /H9251- and /H9252-Agonist with NA Release.  Ephedrine is a mixed acting adrenergic agonist. It is an alkaloid, acts on /H92511-, /H92512-, /H92521-, /H92522-receptors and releases NA from sympathetic nerve endings.Pharmacological ActionsEphedrineVasoconstrictor (α1)CNSstimulantCardiac stimulant (β1)Nasal decongestant (α1)Bronchodilator (β2)Mydriatic (α1) Urinary retention

872—AUTONOMIC PHARMACOLOGYUses.  Intravenous ephedrine is the drug of choice to treat hypotension due to spinal anaesthesia as it increases peripheral vascular resistance (PVR), heart rate, cardiac output and thus BP . It was used in heart block, narcolepsy and bronchial asthma. Now, it has been replaced by more selective drugs. The side effects are insomnia, hypertension, tachycardia, palpitation, difﬁculty in urination; tachyphylaxis occurs on repeated administration.Dopamine: /H92511/H11002, /H92512/H11002, /H92521/H11002, and D1-Agonist with NA Release.  DA is a catecholamine and the immediate metabolic precursor of NA. It acts on dopaminergic D1 receptors as well as /H92521/H11002 a n d  /H92511-adrenergic receptors. DA, like adrenaline and noradrenaline, is not effective orally. As DA is rapidly inactivated by COMT and MAO, it is administered  by i.v. infusion.Pharmacological Actions.  At low doses (/H110212 mcg/kg/min), it selectively dilates renal, mesenteric and coronary blood vessels by acting on D1 receptors resulting in an increase in GFR and urine output.At moderate doses (2–5 mcg/kg/min), DA stimulates /H92521-receptors of heart, increases myocardial contractility and cardiac output, but tachycardia is less prominent. It also stimulates dopaminergic receptors resulting in increase in GFR.At high doses (/H1102210 mcg/kg/min), it stimulates vascular /H92511-adrenergic receptors and causes generalized vasoconstriction. This increases afterload and reduces blood ﬂow to renal, mesenteric and other vital organs. So, the beneﬁcial effect seen with low- to-moderate dose of DA is lost at higher doses.Precautions and Adverse Effects.  During DA infusion, the dose, BP , heart rate, ECG and urine output should be carefully monitored. The adverse effects seen are mainly  due to sympathetic stimulation. They are nausea, vomiting, headache, hypertension, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias and angina.Therapeutic Uses 1. Cardiogenic and septic shock: DA can be used because it increases BP as well as selectively dilates renal, mesenteric, coronary blood vessels and improves blood ﬂow to vital organs. 2. Severe heart failure with renal impairment: DA improves both cardiac and renal function.Fenoldopam.  D1 agonist: It is administered as i.v. infusion in hypertensive emergencies.Fenoldopam n D1 agonist n Peripheral vasodilatation n  BPIts side effects are headache, ﬂushing, reﬂex tachycardia and rise in intraocular tension.Anorectics (Anorexiants).

Phenoxybenzamine is a nonselective /H9251-adrenergic blocker that blocks both /H92511- and /H92512-receptors. It binds covalently to /H9251-receptors and causes irrevers-ible blockade. It also inhibits the reuptake of NA into the adrenergic nerve endings. It also blocks histamine (H1), cholinergic and serotonin receptors at higher doses.Noncompetitive antagonismα1, α2receptorsNoradrenaline(agonist)Phenoxybenzamine(antagonist)Pharmacological Effects 1. PVR is reduced due to blockade of vascular /H92511-receptors; has predominant veno-dilating effect.

 2. Increased release of NA from the adrenergic nerve endings due to blockade of presynaptic /H92512-receptors. This may cause cardiac stimulation and produce tachy-cardia, palpitation, cardiac arrhythmias, etc. Other effects shown in Fig. 2.24.Phenoxybenzamine is given orally or through slow i.v. infusion. It has a slow onset but long duration of action because of irreversible blockade of /H9251-receptors. Its main use is in the treat-ment of pheochromocytoma. The side effects are postural hypotension (mainly due to veno-dilatation), tachycardia, palpitation, diarrhoea, nasal stufﬁness, giddiness and impotence.Other effects: Blockade of alpha receptors in nasal blood vessels results in nasal stufﬁness.

90PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESReversible Nonselective /H9251-BlockersPhentolamine.  Phentolamine is an imidazoline derivative. It competitively blocks the effects of NA at both /H92511- and /H92512-adrenergic receptors (competitive antagonism). Venodilatation is more than arteriolar dilation. It can also block 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors, K/H11001 channels; causes histamine release from mast cells.Competitive antagonismα1, α2receptorsNoradrenaline(agonist)Phentolamine(antagonist)Phentolamine is given intravenously and has a rapid onset but short duration of action.Adverse Effects.  They include tachycardia, palpitation, arrhythmias; angina and MI may be precipitated.T olazoline.  T olazoline is similar to phentolamine and is rarely used.Other competitive, nonselective /H9251-blockers are ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, ergotox-ine) and hydrogenated ergot alkaloids (dihydroergotamine).Selective /H92511-BlockersPrazosin is a potent and selective /H92511-adrenergic receptor blocker. It is given orally. It is well absorbed from GI tract but undergoes extensive ﬁrst-pass metabolism. The effects of /H9251-blockade are depicted in Fig. 2.24. Unlike nonselective /H9251-blockers, selective /H92511-blockers produce minimal or no tachycardia (as presynaptic /H92512-receptors are not blocked). It causes both arteriolar and venodilatation; arteriolar dilatation is more prominent.Adverse Effects.  First-dose phenomenon (mechanism): Within 30–90 minutes of oral administration of ﬁrst dose of prazosin, postural hypotension and syncopal attacks  may be seen. Therefore, the initial dose should be small (1 mg). It is usually given at bed  time so that the patient remains in bed for several hours and the risk of syncopal attack is reduced.It may cause nasal stufﬁness, tachycardia, impaired ejaculation and impotence.Other Selective /H92511-BlockersI Terazosin is similar to prazosin, but less potent than prazosin. It is almost com-pletely absorbed after oral administration and has a longer duration of action.I Doxazosin is the longest acting selective /H92511-blocker. The haemodynamic effects, bioavailability and extent of metabolism are similar to prazosin.I Alfuzosin blocks all subtypes of /H92511-receptors (/H92511A, /H92511B and /H92511D). It is orally effective and used in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).I Tamsulosin is an uroselective /H92511-blocker (/H92511A). At low doses, it reduces the resis-tance to ﬂow of urine with little effect on BP . It is administered orally and is the preferred /H92511-blocker for treatment of BPH in normotensive patients. It may cause retrograde ejaculation.I Silodosin is a selective /H92511A-blocker; useful orally in BPH. The adverse effects are postural hypotension and retrograde ejaculation.Therapeutic Uses of /H9251-Blockers 1. Pheochromocytoma: It is a tumour of adrenal medulla, which releases large amounts of adrenaline and NA. The signs and symptoms include a sudden and paroxysmal rise in BP with headache, palpitation and excessive sweating. The  

912—AUTONOMIC PHARMACOLOGYdiagnosis of pheochromocytoma is usually made by estimating catecholamines, VMA and other metabolites in blood and urine (normal VMA: 4–8 mg per  24 hours urine sample), CT and MRI scan.The deﬁnitive treatment for pheochromocytoma is surgery. In the preoperative period, phenoxybenzamine is used to control hypertension and restore blood volume. It is a nonselective and irreversible /H9251-blocker. Blockade of vascular /H92511-receptors causes vasodilatation and fall in BP . It can also be used in inop-erable cases of pheochromocytoma./H9252-Blockers (propranolol) are used to control the cardiac manifestations – tachycardia and arrhythmias due to excess catecholamines. /H9252-Blockers should not be given alone in pheochromocytoma because the blockade of vascular /H92522-receptors causes unopposed /H92511-action which leads to severe rise in BP due to vasoconstriction. This may be fatal. Therefore, prior administration  of /H9251-receptor blocker is a must before giving /H9252-blockers.Metyrosine is used as an adjuvant in pheochromocytoma. It inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme and reduces the synthesis of catecholamines.During surgery, handling of the tumour results in sudden release of large  quantity of catecholamines, which may cause marked rise in BP that can be controlled by i.v. phentolamine. It is a nonselective /H9251-blocker with rapid onset of action. 2. Hypertensive emergencies: Intravenous phentolamine can be used in the follow-ing conditions, because of its rapid onset of action:I T o control hypertensive episodes intraoperatively during surgery of pheochro-mocytoma.I T o control hypertensive crisis due to clonidine withdrawal.I T o control hypertensive crisis due to ‘cheese reaction’ . 3. Essential hypertension: Among /H9251-blockers, selective /H92511-antagonists are preferred to nonselective /H9251-blockers in the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension. Selective /H92511-antagonists cause less tachycardia and have favourable effects on lipid proﬁle. 4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia: Selective /H92511-blockers are used in BPH; they decrease tone of smooth muscle in the neck of bladder and prostate resulting in reduction in resistance to urinary ﬂow. Prazosin, doxazosin, terazosin and alfuzo-sin are particularly useful in patients who also have hypertension. Tamsulosin is preferred for BPH in normotensive patients. 5. Tissue necrosis: Phentolamine is inﬁltrated locally to prevent tissue necrosis due to extravasation of /H9251-agonists. 6. Male sexual dysfunction: Local injection of phentolamine with papaverine may be used in the treatment of male sexual dysfunction.  PH1.40 7. Other uses include congestive cardiac failure and peripheral vascular diseases.Selective /H92512-Adrenergic BlockerY ohimbine.  Y ohimbine is an alkaloid. It competitively blocks /H92512-receptors. It also has 5-HT receptor blocking effect. It is an aphrodisiac, but is rarely used therapeutically./H9252-Adrenergic Blockers/H9252-adrenergic antagonists block the /H9252-receptor–mediated effects of sympathetic stimula-tion and adrenergic drugs.

Pindolol, acebutolol and labetalol have partial agonistic activity (intrinsic sympathomimetic activity [ISA]). They stimulate /H9252-receptors partially in the absence of catecholamines.Propranolol, pindolol, acebutolol, metoprolol and labetalol have membrane-stabiliz-ing activity (local anaesthetic activity).Mechanism of Action.  Propranolol is the prototype drug. /H9252-Blockers competitively block the /H9252-receptor–mediated actions of catecholamines and other adrenergic agonists.β-ReceptorsCatecholamines and otheradrenergic agonistsPropranolol and otherβ-blockers (antagonists)Pharmacological Properties of /H9252-Blockers 1. Cardiovascular system: (a) Heart: /H9252-Blockers depress all cardiac properties. (i) Decrease heart rate (negative chronotropic effect). (ii) Decrease force of myocardial contractility (negative inotropic effect). (iii) Decrease cardiac output. (iv) Depress SA node and A V nodal activity. (v) Increase refractory period of A V node. (vi) Decrease conduction in atria and A V node (negative dromotropic effect). (vii) Decrease automaticity of ectopic foci. (viii) Decrease cardiac work, thus reduce O2 requirement of the myocardium. Only in high doses, some of them have membrane-stabilizing effect. (b) Blood vessels: Blockade of /H92522-receptors of blood vessels initially may cause rise in PVR due to unopposed /H92511-action. However, continued administration of these drugs leads to a fall in PVR in patients with hypertension due to chronic reduction in cardiac output. Both systolic and diastolic BP is reduced. (c) They also reduce the release of renin from juxtaglomerular apparatus due to blockade of /H92521-receptors and decrease central sympathetic outﬂow. 2. Respiratory system: Blockade of /H92522-receptors in bronchial smooth muscle can produce severe bronchospasm in patients with COPD and asthma. Therefore,  /H9252-blockers should be avoided in patients with asthma and COPD. Selective /H92521-blockers such as atenolol and metoprolol are less likely to cause bronchospasm. 3. Skeletal muscle: On chronic use, /H9252-blockers may cause skeletal muscle weakness and tiredness due to blockade of /H92522-receptors of the skeletal muscle and blood vessels supplying it. They also reduce stress-induced tremors.

932—AUTONOMIC PHARMACOLOGY 4. Metabolic effects: /H9252-Blockers inhibit glycogenolysis and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia. They also mask the warning signs and symptoms of hypoglycae-mia. Therefore, /H9252-blockers should be used cautiously in diabetes patients on hy-poglycaemic agents. Chronic use of nonselective /H9252-blockers decreases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol ratio which may increase the risk of coronary artery disease. 5. Eye: /H9252-Blockers on topical administration decrease IOP by reducing the secretion of aqueous humour (see p. 58).Pharmacokinetics.  Propranolol is highly lipid soluble and is well absorbed from GI tract. However, the bioavailability of propranolol is low because of its extensive ﬁrst-pass metabolism. It is highly bound to plasma proteins; has large volume of distribution; freely crosses BBB, and metabolites are excreted in urine.Adverse Effects of /H9252-Blockers.  They are mainly an extension of pharmacological actions. 1. CVS:I Bradycardia, heart block and may precipitate congestive heart failure in patients with low-cardiac reserve.I Blockade of vascular /H92522-receptors causes unopposed /H92511-action, reduces further blood supply and may worsen peripheral vascular disease.I /H9252-Blockers can exacerbate Prinzmetal angina (variant angina) due to unop-posed /H92511-action, hence are contraindicated (see p. 117) in this condition. 2. Respiratory system: Blockade of /H92522-receptors in the bronchial smooth muscle can cause severe bronchospasm in patients with asthma and COPD. Hence, /H9252-blockers are contraindicated in the above conditions. 3. CNS: Sleep disturbances, hallucinations, fatigue and mental depression. 4. Metabolic: Recovery from hypoglycaemia (induced by antidiabetic drugs) is delayed by /H9252-blockers. /H9252-Blockers may mask the warning signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia. 5. Muscular weakness and tiredness: These are due to reduced blood ﬂow to skeletal muscle. 6. Withdrawal symptoms: Abrupt withdrawal of /H9252-blockers after chronic use is dangerous because angina or frank myocardial infarction (MI) and even sudden death can occur. This is due to upregulation (supersensitivity) of /H9252-receptors in response to prolonged blockade (see p. 27).Drug Interactions 1. Propranolol /H11003 verapamil: They produce additive cardiac depressant effects and may cause CCF, bradyarrhythmias, heart block or even cardiac arrest. 2. Insulin/sulphonylureas /H11003 /H9252-blockers: Nonselective /H9252-blockers inhibit glycoge-nolysis and delay recovery from hypoglycaemia (Fig. 2.25). They mask warning signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia. 3. Cholestyramine and colestipol /H11003 /H9252-blockers: Cholestyramine and colestipol are bile acid–binding resins. They bind to /H9252-blockers in the gut and interfere with the absorption of /H9252-blockers. 4. Propranolol /H11003 lignocaine: Propranolol reduces the clearance of lignocaine by decreasing hepatic blood ﬂow. 5. Propranolol /H11003 NSAIDs: NSAIDs by inhibiting PG synthesis promote Na/H11001 and water retention on chronic use. Thus, they decrease antihypertensive effect of  /H9252-blockers. 6. Propranolol /H11003 chlorpromazine: Propranolol interferes with the ﬁrst-pass metabolism of chlorpromazine and increases its bioavailability.

Therapeutic Uses of /H9252-Blockers 1. Hypertension: /H9252-Blockers are useful for all grades of hypertension. These drugs are preferred especially in patients with angina, MI or cardiac arrhythmias (see p. 105).The advantages of /H9252-blockers are as follows:I Sodium and water retention is rare.I Cheaper.I Have a long duration of action.I Well tolerated. 2. Angina prophylaxis and MI: /H9252-Blockers reduce myocardial O2 demand by de-creasing heart rate, myocardial contractility and arterial pressure. They improve exercise tolerance and reduce frequency of anginal episodes. Use of /H9252-blockers early in acute phase of MI may limit infarct size. Long-term use of /H9252-blockers may reduce mortality and reinfarction. 3. Cardiac arrhythmias: /H9252-Blockers are mainly used in atrial arrhythmias such as atrial ﬁbrillation, atrial ﬂutter and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) but rarely for ventricular arrhythmias (see p. 135).Fig. 2.25 Interaction between insulin/sulphonylureas and /H9252-blockers.Insulin/sulphonylureas (antidiabetic agent)Blood sugar (hypoglycaemia)Sympathetic stimulationSkeletalmuscleVasoconstrictionrise in BP due to unopposed /H92511-actionTremorsTachycardiapalpitationMask the warningsymptoms of hypoglycaemiaCauseCausedelayed recoveryfrom hypoglycaemia1HeartBlood vessel2/H92511↓↓

Congestive cardiac failure (see p. 125): Chronic use of /H9252-blockers such as carve-dilol, metoprolol and bisoprolol has shown to reduce mortality rate in chronic heart failure. 5. Pheochromocytoma: /H9252-Blockers are used to control the cardiac manifestations of pheochromocytoma, but should not be given alone (see p. 90-91). 6. Glaucoma (p. 58): /H9252-Blockers decrease the IOP by reducing the production of aqueous humour. Timolol, carteolol, levobunolol, betaxolol, etc. are used topi-cally in glaucoma. Timolol is the most frequently used /H9252-blocker in glaucoma. Betaxolol is a selective /H92521-blocker; hence, systemic adverse effects (cardiovascular and pulmonary) are rare. 7. Prophylaxis of migraine: Propranolol and metoprolol are effective in reducing the frequency of migraine headache. The mechanism is not known. 8 .  Hyperthyroidism: The signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism such as tachycar-dia, palpitation, tremor and anxiety are reduced due to blockade of /H9252-receptors. Propranolol inhibits the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. It is also used in thyroid storm. 9. Essential tremors: Oral propranolol may give some beneﬁt in patients with essential tremors. 10. Acute anxiety states: /H9252-Blockers are useful in controlling the symptoms of acute anxiety such as palpitation, tachycardia, tremor and sweating. 11. Alcohol withdrawal: Propranolol may produce some beneﬁt in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. 12. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: Propranolol decreases outﬂow resistance. 13. Dissecting aortic aneurysm: /H9252-Blockers are useful in the management of dissecting aortic aneurysm – they decrease cardiac contractility and the rate of development of pressure during systole.Important features of /H9252-blockers are given in Table 2.12.Selective /H92521-Adrenergic BlockersSelective /H92521-blockers have a lower risk of bronchoconstriction, less effect on carbohy-drate metabolism, lipid proﬁle and exercise capacity.EsmololI It is administered intravenously.I It is rapidly metabolized by esterases in RBCs; t1/2 is about 10 minutes.I It has no membrane-stabilizing effect; no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.I It is a selective /H92521-blocker and has short duration of action.Esmolol is used for rapid control of ventricular rate in supraventricular arrhythmias.

98CHAPTER 3Drugs Affecting Cardiovascular FunctionAntihypertensive Drugs  PH1.26, PH1.27Hypertension is a common cardiovascular disease affecting worldwide population.  A persistent and sustained high blood pressure has damaging effects on the heart, brain, kidneys and eyes. Hypertension could be: 1. Primary or essential hypertension: It is the most common type. There is no speciﬁc underlying cause. 2. Secondary hypertension: It can be due to renal, vascular, endocrine disorders, etc.BLOOD PRESSUREVarious guidelines for hypertension are available (JNC 8 – 2014, American College  of Cardiology [ACC] and American Heart Association [AHA] Guidelines, 2017).  A systolic blood pressure of /H11021120 mm Hg and diastolic pressure /H1102180 mm Hg is considered as normal BP. The risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) increases with increase in blood pressure. This risk is taken into consideration while determining the target BP to be achieved following initiation of treatment with antihypertensive drugs.I Systolic blood pressure (SBP): It is the maximum pressure recorded during ventricular systole.I Diastolic blood pressure (DBP): It is the minimum pressure recorded during ventricular diastole.I Pulse pressure (PP): It is the difference between SBP and DBP (PP /H11005 SBP – DBP).I Mean arterial pressure: DBP /H11001 1/3 PP .CLASSIFICATION OF ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS (Fig. 3.1) 1.

Inhibit degradation of bradykinin (potent vasodilator) by ACE. 3. Stimulate synthesis of vasodilating prostaglandins through bradykinin.All these actions contribute to their antihypertensive effect. They also reverse ventricular and vascular hypertrophyPharmacokinetics.  ACE inhibitors are usually given orally. In hypertensive emer-gency, enalaprilat can be given intravenously. Food reduces the absorption of  captopril; hence, it should be given 1 hour before meals. ACE inhibitors poorly cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB), are metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine (Table 3.1).Adverse Effects* and Contraindications 1 .  Cough (dry cough): Bradykinin is metabolized by ACE. Inhibition of ACE results in increased bradykinin levels in the lungs and causes cough. Appearance of intractable cough is an indication to stop the drug. It subsides following discontinuation of the drug. 2. Angioedema: Swelling in the nose, lips, mouth, throat, larynx and glottis. There can be airway obstruction – patient’s airway should be protected. If required, adrenaline, glucocorticoids and antihistamines should be administered. 3. Proteinuria can occur rarely. The drug should be discontinued. 4. Teratogenic effect (growth retardation, foetal hypotension, renal failure and neo-natal death) – hence contraindicated in pregnancy.Angiotensin IAngiotensin-converting enzyme(ACE)Angiotensin IIAldosteronerelease↑ Sympatheticactivity Blood vesselConstriction of blood vessel↑ Total peripheral resistance↑BPCardiachypertrophy andremodellingACE inhibitors

HypOtension may occur following the ﬁrst dose of ACE inhibitor – this can be marked in patients who are volume depleted or have congestive heart failure (CHF). 6. NeutroPenia is rare. 7. Rashes. 8. Itching: Discontinuation of the drug is not required. 9. Loss of taste sensation (dysgeusia). 10. Hyperkalaemia: In patients receiving ACE inhibitors, hyperkalaemia may occur in the presence of renal insufﬁciency or when they are combined with potassium-sparing diuretics.ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis as acute renal failure can be precipitated. When renal perfusion pressure is low, angiotensin II maintains glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR) by constriction of efferent arteriole. This is blocked by ACE inhibitor.Bilateral renal artery stenosis↓ Efferent arteriolar pressure↓ GFRAngiotensin IIACE inhibitors: block the formation of angiotensin II↑ Efferent arteriolar pressureMaintains GFR−−
ACE inhibitors are also contraindicated in patients with single kidney with renal artery stenosis as they can precipitate renal failure.Drug Interactions 1. ACE inhibitors /H11003 potassium-sparing diuretics: Simultaneous administration of these drugs can cause dangerous hyperkalaemia. 2. ACE inhibitors /H11003 lithium: ACE inhibitors retard renal elimination of lithium and potentiate its toxicity. 3. ACE inhibitors /H11003 NSAIDs: NSAIDs by inhibiting PG synthesis promote Na/H11001 and water retention on chronic use. Thus, they decrease antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors. 4. Thiazides /H11003 ACE inhibitors: Diuretics increase the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors by promoting the loss of Na/H11001 and water. Serum potassium levels are maintained by the combination.Therapeutic Uses of ACE Inhibitors 1. Hypertension: (Mode of action:  see p. 100) ACE inhibitors are used in all grades of hypertension. They decrease cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality (fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal and nonfatal stroke, CHF and sudden death). They do not cause electrolyte disturbances, hyperuricaemia, alterations in lipid levels and sexual dysfunction. They are preferred in hypertensive 

1033—DRUGS AFFECTING CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTIONpatients with diabetes because they delay or prevent progression of renal compli-cations. They are also preferred in hypertensives with coexisting CHF, left  ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and peripheral vascular disease. 2. Acute MI: ACE inhibitors should be started within 24 hours in patients with MI. They have shown both short-term and long-term improvement in survival and decrease in reinfarction. 3. CHF: ACE inhibitors should be prescribed to all patients with impaired LV func-tion (for explanation see p. 125). 4. Diabetic nephropathy: ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are the preferred drugs in diabetic nephropathy in hypertensive as well as normotensive patients.They decrease systemic blood pressure and dilate renal efferent arteriole ng intraglomerular pressure; inhibit angiotensin II-mediated mesangial cell growth. They decrease microalbuminuria. 5. Scleroderma renal crisis: ACE inhibitors prevent the effects of angiotensin II in the renal artery; thus, they are effective in the treatment of scleroderma renal crisis. Survival rate is increased.Angiotensin Receptor Blockers or Angiotensin Receptor AntagonistsThey are losartan, irbesartan, candesartan, olmesartan, valsartan and telmisartan;  administered orally. The two types of angiotensin II receptors are AT1 and AT2. Most of the effects of angiotensin II are mediated by AT1 receptors. They are vasoconstriction, aldosterone secretion and the release of noradrenaline from sympathetic nerve endings. The role of AT2 receptors is not known.Angiotensin II(Agonist)Angiotensin receptors (AT1)(Competitive antagonism)ARBs(Antagonists)Angiotensin receptor blockers competitively inhibit the binding of angiotensin II to AT1-receptor subtype and block its effects. Angiotensin receptor blockers produce effects similar to those of ACE inhibitors. Angiotensin receptor blockers do not affect bradykinin degradation.Adverse Effects.  Angiotensin receptor blockers are better tolerated as compared to ACE inhibitors. They cause headache, hypotension, weakness, rashes, nausea, vomiting and teratogenic effects. They may cause hyperkalaemia in patients with renal failure or in patients on K/H11001-sparing diuretics. They are less likely to produce cough or angioedema than ACE inhibitors.Uses.  Angiotensin receptor blockers are used in hypertension, congestive cardiac failure (CCF), MI and diabetic nephropathy. The antihypertensive efﬁcacy of ARBs is compa-rable with that of ACE inhibitors. Like ACE inhibitors, ARBs prevent/delay the develop-ment of renal complications in diabetes patients. Angiotensin receptor blockers are mainly indicated in patients who develop cough with ACE inhibitors.In CCF and MI, ARBs are used in patients who are intolerant to ACE inhibitors.Direct Renin Inhibitor: AliskirenAliskirenReninAngiotensinogenAngiotensin I/H11002

104PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESAliskiren, by inhibiting renin, decreases levels of angiotensin I and angiotensin II. It is useful in hypertension in combination with diuretics, ACE inhibitors or ARBs  (increased antihypertensive efﬁcacy). It is administered orally. Adverse effects include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, headache and angioedema.DiureticsThiazides and related drugs are widely used drugs for uncomplicated hypertension. Chlorothiazide, hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone are the commonly used  thiazides.Thiazide Diuretics.  These are used in uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension and have a long duration of action. They should be administered in a low dose, i.e.  12.5 mg of chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide. If the antihypertensive response is not adequate, the dose can be increased up to 25 mg/day. Beyond this dose, thiazides  are not safe. Potassium-sparing diuretics are usually given with thiazides to counteract K/H11001 loss and increase antihypertensive efﬁcacy. Use of ACE inhibitors with thiazides decreases K/H11001 loss by thiazides and enhances antihypertensive effect.Mechanism of Action of ThiazidesOn chronic therapyThiazidesInhibit Na/H11001–Cl/H11002 symport in the early part of the DCTPromote Na/H11001, H2O excretion↓BP↓CO↓PVRNa/H11001 concentration in the vascular smooth muscle↓Adverse Effects.  They are hypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia, hyperuricaemia, hyperlipi-daemia, hypercalcaemia, impotence and decreased libido.Advantages of ThiazidesI Have long duration of action (administered once daily).I Are cheap.I Are well tolerated by elderly patients.I Decrease the incidence of fracture in elderly patients by reducing urinary Ca2/H11001 excretion.I Have synergistic effect when used in combination with other antihypertensive drugs.Chlorthalidone is a frequently used thiazide-like diuretic in hypertension as it has a long duration of action. Indapamide and metolazone are more potent, longer acting and produce fewer adverse effects than thiazides.Loop Diuretics.  These drugs have short duration of action, so a sustained Na/H11001 deﬁcit is not maintained; therefore, they are not used routinely in hypertension except in the presence of renal or cardiac failure.

1053—DRUGS AFFECTING CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTIONCalcium Channel BlockersVerapamil, diltiazem and dihydropyridines (DHPs; nifedipine, amlodipine, cilnidipine, felodipine, nicardipine, isradipine, etc.) are useful in all grades of hypertension.The antihypertensive effect is mainly due to peripheral vasodilatation. DHPs are more likely to cause headache, ﬂushing, ankle oedema, palpitation and reﬂex tachycar-dia. The use of sustained-release preparations reduces the incidence of side effects.  /H9252-Blockers can be used with nifedipine to counteract the reﬂex tachycardia. Reﬂex tachycardia is minimal or absent with verapamil and diltiazem because of their greater cardiac depressant effect. Verapamil and diltiazem should be avoided in patients with cardiac dysfunction because of their cardiac depressant effect. CCBs are particularly useful in elderly patients, in patients with angina, asthma, peripheral vascular disease, migraine, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes and renal dysfunction. They are used as mono-therapy or in combination with other antihypertensives. They decrease albuminuria and also slow the progression of nephropathy in diabetes patients. Intravenous clevidipine is useful in treating severe hypertension.Sympatholytics/H9252-Adrenergic Blockers.  /H9252-Blockers are effective in all grades of hypertension.I Selective /H9252-blockers (block only /H92521), e.g. atenolol, metoprolol, esmolol and betaxololI Nonselective /H9252-blockers (block both /H92521 and /H92522), e.g. propranolol and timololDuring initial therapy with /H9252-blockers, cardiac output (CO) decreases but peripheral vascular resistance may increase. On chronic therapy, peripheral vascular resistance gradually decreases because of sustained reduction in CO – BP falls. Other mechanisms of antihypertensive effect are shown in Fig. 3.3. /H9252-Blockers are mainly useful in:I Y oung hypertensives with high renin levels.I Patients with associated conditions, such as angina, post-MI, migraine and psychosomatic disorders.I Patients receiving vasodilators to counteract reﬂex tachycardia.

Clonidine is a centrally acting antihypertensive drug.Mechanism of Action (Fig. 3.4).  Clonidine is effective orally; it is highly lipid soluble and rapidly crosses the BBB. It has a short duration of action, requires twice a day  administration. Transdermal patch of clonidine controls BP for a week.Adverse Effects.  Dryness of mouth and eyes, sedation, depression, bradycardia, impotence, nausea, dizziness, parotid gland swelling and pain are the adverse effects of clonidine. Postural hypotension may occur.Sudden stoppage of clonidine after prolonged use may cause withdrawal syndrome – headache, nervousness, tachycardia, sweating, tremors, palpitation and rebound  hypertension. This is due to:I Supersensitivity of /H9251-receptors.I Precipitous release of large amount of stored catecholamines.This is treated with intravenous sodium nitroprusside or labetalol.Uses.

Stable angina (classical angina): It is characterized by episodes of chest pain com-monly associated with exertion. 2. Unstable angina: It is characterized by angina at rest or increased frequency and duration of anginal attacks. In most cases, it is commonly due to rupture of an atheromatous plaque and platelet deposition in the coronary artery, leading  to progressive thrombosis. 3. Prinzmetal angina (variant angina): Angina that occurs at rest and is due to spasm of coronary arteries.Pathophysiology.  Angina occurs due to imbalance in oxygen supply and oxygen demand by the myocardium.

Pharmacological Actions of Nitrates.  Nitroglycerin is the prototype drug. Nitrates have no direct action on the heart. 1. On vascular smooth muscle: Nitroglycerin quickly relieves anginal pain by decreasing the O2 requirement and increasing O2 delivery to the myocardium.Venodilatation(predominant effect)Peripheral pooling of blood↓↓Venous return to the heart↓↓Preload↓↓Left and rightend-diastolic ventricular volume↓↓Cardiac work↓↓O2 requirement of myocardium (↓ O2 demand)Arteriolar dilatation↓↓PVR    ↓AfterloadDilatation of largecoronary vessels andcollateral vesselsIncreased blood ﬂ ow to ischaemic area due to redistribution of coronary blood ﬂ owIncreased O2 delivery to ischaemic areaRelief of anginal pain

114PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES 2. On other smooth muscles: Smooth muscles of the bronchi, oesophagus, biliary tract, etc. are relaxed by nitrates.Pharmacokinetics.  Organic nitrates are readily absorbed through the buccal mucous membrane, skin and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. All nitrates except isosorbide mononi-trate undergo extensive ﬁrst-pass metabolism; hence, oral bioavailability of nitrates is very low. Sublingual route produces rapid onset (2–5 minutes) but short duration of  action. Absorption through skin is slow; hence, transdermal route is used for a prolonged effect. The metabolites are excreted mainly in urine as glucuronide derivatives.Adverse Effects.  Adverse effects are due to extensive vasodilatation. They are headache, postural hypotension, tachycardia, palpitation, weakness, ﬂushing and rarely syncope. T o avoid these symptoms, the tablet may be spit out as soon as the pain is relieved. Overdos-age may cause methaemoglobinaemia.Tolerance.  T olerance to nitrates occurs on prolonged use of nitrates orally/as transder-mal patch/i.v. infusion. Development of tolerance is rare following intermittent exposure (e.g. sublingual glyceryl trinitrate [GTN]). T olerance is due to decreased NO generation, depletion of sulphydryl radicals in the cell or generation of free radicals, etc. Nitrates  also exhibit cross-tolerance. T olerance can be prevented by giving a nitrate-free interval (8–12 hours) each day.Isosorbide Dinitrate.  It can be used sublingually for acute anginal attack and orally for chronic prophylaxis. Its oral bioavailability is low because of ﬁrst-pass metabolism.Isosorbide Mononitrate.  It is preferred over dinitrate for chronic prophylaxis of an-gina, because it has:I Longer duration of action.I High oral bioavailability, as it does not undergo ﬁrst-pass metabolism.Therapeutic Uses of Nitrates 1. Angina (a) For acute attack of angina:I Nitroglycerin is the drug of choice. For an acute attack, nitroglycerin is commonly administered sublingually with an initial dose of 0.5 mg that usually relieves pain in 2–3 minutes. Patient is advised to spit out the tablet as soon as the pain is relieved to avoid side effects (hypotension and head-ache). If the pain is not relieved, the tablet can be repeated after 5 minutes but not more than three tablets in 15 minutes. Nitroglycerin undergoes extensive ﬁrst-pass metabolism when swallowed. Nitroglycerin buccal spray can also be used for acute attack of angina.I Isosorbide dinitrate (sublingual) can also relieve acute attack of angina. (b) For prophylaxis of angina: Longer acting nitrate preparations are used – isosorbide mononitrate orally; isosorbide dinitrate orally; nitroglycerin oral sustained-release preparation/ointment/disc/patch. Transdermal nitroglyc-erin produces prolonged effect, up to 24 hours (Table 3.4). T o avoid tolerance, the patch should be removed for a few hours (at least 8 hours). Oral nitrates are used for long-term prophylaxis of angina pectoris. They decrease the fre-quency of anginal attacks and improve exercise tolerance. Sublingual nitro-glycerin may be used prophylactically, immediately before exercise or stress. The main disadvantage with long-term use of nitrates is development of toler-ance which can be minimized by a nitrate-free interval of 8–10 hours/day. 2. V ariant angina (Prinzmetal angina): It is due to coronary vasospasm. Episodes of coronary vasospasm are treated with nitrates; for prophylaxis, nitrates and CCBs (amlodipine, nifedipine SR and diltiazem) are effective. Addition of a CCB  

1153—DRUGS AFFECTING CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTION
with nitrate produces better efﬁcacy in variant angina; also reduces the incidence of MI. 3. Unstable angina: It requires treatment with multiple drugs. (a) Antiplatelet agents: Low-dose aspirin, clopidogrel or prasugrel are used. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists (tiroﬁban, eptiﬁbatide or abcix-imab) are useful in high-risk patients with acute coronary syndromes. (b) Anticoagulants: Low-molecular-weight heparin, unfractioned heparin or fondaparinux. (c) Nitrates: Nitroglycerin (sublingual) is usually effective. Intravenous nitroglyc-erin is administered if pain persists or recurs. Nitrates reduce myocardial  oxygen consumption and relieve coronary vasospasm (BP should be moni-tored during i.v. infusion of nitroglycerin). (d) /H9252-Blockers: They (atenolol, metoprolol) are routinely administered in unstable angina unless contraindicated. (e) CCBs: Amlodipine, nifedipine SR, diltiazem or verapamil are used if symptoms persist in patients on nitrates and /H9252-blockers or if /H9252-blockers are contraindicated. (f) Statins: They have been shown to improve outcome in unstable angina. 4. MI: For management of acute MI, intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin is useful for persistent or recurrent ischaemic pain and treatment of LV failure. It should be avoided if there is hypotension and in patients who received sildenaﬁl or tadalaﬁl in the past 24 hours. 5. CCF: The role of nitrates in CCF is discussed on p. 124. Intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin is used mainly for acute heart failure. Monitoring of BP is necessary to avoid hypotension. Headache may limit the dose of nitrates. 6. Hypertensive emergency: Intravenous infusion of nitroglycerin is used because of rapid onset of action, but the disadvantage is development of tolerance. 7. Biliary colic: Sublingual nitroglycerin can be used to relieve biliary spasm and associated pain. 8 .  Cyanide poisoning: In cyanide poisoning, the oxygen carrying capacity of blood is not affected. Cyanide inhibits cytochrome oxidase and prevents DrugDosageDuration of actionGlyceryl trinitrate  (GTN; nitroglycerin)• 0.5 mg (500 mcg) sublingual• 0.4 mg (400 mcg) lingual spray• 5–10 mg transdermal patch• 5–15 mg oral SR• 10–30 minutes• 10–30 minutes• Up to 24 hoursTransdermal patch should be removed for few hours each day to avoid the development of toleranceIsosorbide dinitrate• 2.5–10 mg sublingual• 5–40 mg oral• 20–60 minutes• 6–8 hoursIsosorbide mononitrate20–40 mg oral6–10 hoursErythrityl tetranitrate20–40 mg oral4–6 hoursPentaerythritol  tetranitrate80 mg oral10–12 hoursTable 3.4   Nitrates used in the treatment of angina

The main objective of treatment is to inactivate cyanide in the cells. In the absence of nitrites, cyanide binds to cytochrome oxidase caus-ing inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation.Step 1.  Amyl nitrite and sodium nitrite are used in the treatment of cyanide poison-ing. Nitrites rapidly convert haemoglobin to methaemoglobin.Step 2.  Methaemoglobin combines with cyanide to form nontoxic cyanomethaemoglobin.Step 3.  Intravenous sodium thiosulphate converts cyanomethaemoglobin to sodium thiocyanate, which is rapidly excreted in urine.Note.  Hydroxocobalamin can be used in cyanide poisoning. It binds cyanide to form cyanocobalamin./H9252-Adrenergic BlockersThe beneﬁcial effects of /H9252-blockers in exertional angina are mainly due to negative chro-notropic and negative inotropic effects.Blockβ1-Receptors of heartPropranololMetoprololAtenololTimolol↓ Heart rate↓ Force of myocardial  contraction↓↓ Cardiac work↓ Myocardial O consumption2/H9252-Blockers have slow onset of action and are useful in anginal prophylaxis. /H9252-Blockers improve exercise tolerance and reduce the frequency of anginal episodes. Use of  /H9252-blocker (those without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity) decreases mortality in patients with recent MI; hence, it should be started early and continued indeﬁnitely. Cardioselective /H9252-blockers are preferred. /H9252-Blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (e.g. pindolol) should be avoided as they may worsen angina.Adverse Effects.  They include bradycardia, heart block, bronchospasm in patients with bronchial asthma, etc./H9252-Blockers can increase LV end-diastolic volume.β-Blockers↓ Heart rate↓ Myocardial    contractility ↓ Cardiac outputIncrease left ventricular end-diastolic volume

1173—DRUGS AFFECTING CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTIONThis disadvantage of /H9252-blockers can be counteracted by combining them with nitrates. /H9252-Blockers can exacerbate cardiac failure, peripheral vascular disease and may precipitate bronchospasm in patients with bronchial asthma./H9252-Blockers should not be withdrawn abruptly because this may precipitate dangerous arrhythmias or MI./H9252-Blockers are contraindicated in variant angina which occurs due to coronary vaso-spasm. Coronary artery has /H92511- and /H92522-adrenergic receptors. Blockade of /H92522-receptors results in unopposed /H92511-mediated vasoconstriction and aggravation of variant angina.Calcium Channel Blockers 1. Phenylalkylamine: Verapamil. 2. Benzothiazepine: Diltiazem. 3. Dihydropyridines (DHPs): Nifedipine, amlodipine, cilnidipine, nicardipine, felo-dipine, isradipine, nisoldipine, lacidipine.Mechanism of Action.  Voltage-sensitive Ca2/H11001 channels are of ﬁve subtypes: L, N, T, P and R. L-type is predominantly present in cardiac and smooth muscle cells.CCBs block voltage-sensitive L-type Ca2+ channels by  binding to α1 -subunitPrevent entry of Ca2+ into the cellNo excitation–contraction coupling in the  heart and vascular smooth musclePharmacological Actions.  CCBs act mainly on cardiac and smooth muscles. They have little action on veins, hence do not alter preload. 1. V erapamil: It is a phenylalkylamine and has predominant action on heart.I It decreases force of contraction (negative inotropic effect) and decreases heart rate (negative chronotropic effect). This reduces oxygen requirement of the myocardium.I It depresses SA node and slows A V conduction (negative dromotropic effect) by prolonging effective refractory period (ERP).Verapamil is a less potent coronary and peripheral vasodilator than DHPs. 2. Diltiazem: It dilates peripheral and coronary arteries but its vasodilating property is less marked than DHPs and verapamil. It also causes negative inotropic,  chronotropic and dromotropic effects. It is used in the treatment of angina,  hypertension and supraventricular arrhythmias. 3. DHPs: These are potent arteriolar dilators and reduce peripheral vascular resis-tance. Higher doses are required for signiﬁcant cardiac effects – cardiac depressant effect is less than verapamil and diltiazem.DihydropyridinesRelax vascular smooth muscleDecrease peripheralvascular resistanceDecreaseafterloadCoronaryvasodilatation↓ O2 consumptionof myocardium

118PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES (a) Nifedipine: It is the prototype drug. It has a predominant action on vascular smooth muscle. Reﬂex tachycardia and palpitation are commonly seen with nifedipine. This can be minimized by using sustained-release preparation or counteracted by adding a /H9252-blocker. (b) Amlodipine: It is absorbed slowly after oral administration. Palpitation and reﬂex tachycardia are less common with amlodipine. It is more potent and has a longer duration of action than nifedipine. It dilates both peripheral and coronary vessels. It has high oral bioavailability. It is mainly used in angina and hypertension. The common side effects are headache and ankle oedema. Reﬂex postcapillary constriction nh hydrostatic pressure n ankle oedema.S (–) Amlodipine: It is an active S (–) enantiomer of amlodipine. It is more potent and causes less adverse effects. (c) Nicardipine: Its antianginal effects are similar to nifedipine. It acts predomi-nantly on coronary vessels. (d) Felodipine: It has greater vascular selectivity than nifedipine and amlodipine. Like nifedipine, it can also produce tachycardia and palpitation. (e) Lacidipine, lercanidipine and benidipine: They have long duration of action. (f) Nimodipine: It has high lipid solubility, freely crosses BBB and selectively dilates cerebral blood vessels. It is used to prevent cerebral vasospasm and subsequent neurological defects in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage. (5) Cilnidipine: It blocks L-type and N-type calcium channels. Hence, reﬂex tachycardia and ankle oedema is less.Pharmacokinetics.  All CCBs are well absorbed through GI tract but they undergo varying degree of ﬁrst-pass metabolism. All are highly bound to plasma proteins,  metabolized in liver and excreted in urine.Adverse Effects.  They are mentioned in Table 3.5.Uses of CCBs 1 .  Exertional angina (for detailed explanation, see Pharmacological Actions): The beneﬁcial effect in angina pectoris with CCBs is mainly due to a decrease in myo-cardial O2 consumption (following gHR, gforce of contraction or gafterload), and dilatation of coronary arteries. Diltiazem, verapamil and DHPs (amlodipine, nife-dipine SR and nicardipine) are used in stable angina. Felodipine, isradipine and nisoldipine are also effective in angina. Diltiazem and verapamil produce less reﬂex tachycardia. Diltiazem is preferred to verapamil, as it has fewer side effects. DHPs like nifedipine and felodipine may aggravate anginal symptoms because of reﬂex tachycardia, which can be counteracted by combining them with /H9252-blockers.NifedipineVerapamilDiltiazem• Hypotension• Palpitation• Reﬂex tachycardia• Oedema• Flushing• Fatigue• Dizziness• Sedation• Constipation• Sinus bradycardia• Oedema; may precipitate CCF in patients with low cardiac reserve• AV block and headache, rarely• Headache• Hypotension• Bradycardia• Oedema• AV block occurs rarelyTable 3.5   Adverse effects of calcium channel blockers

1193—DRUGS AFFECTING CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTION 2. V ariant angina: It is due to coronary spasm. Amlodipine, nifedipine SR and diltiazem can be used prophylactically. They relieve pain effectively by attenuat-ing the coronary vasospasm. Combined use of DHPs and nitrates has shown  increased efﬁcacy in patients with variant angina. 3. Unstable angina: CCBs are used mainly when symptoms are not relieved by nitrates//H9252-blockers or if these drugs are contraindicated. 4. Supraventricular arrhythmias: Verapamil is useful for supraventricular arrhyth-mias because of its depressant action on SA and A V nodes. It prolongs the refrac-tory period and decreases the conduction velocity of A V node thereby reduces the ventricular rate in atrial ﬂutter or atrial ﬁbrillation. Diltiazem is also useful but is less effective than verapamil. 5. Hypertension: DHPs, diltiazem and verapamil are used in hypertension. They control blood pressure by their vasodilatory effect. They can be safely used in  hypertensive patients with asthma, hyperlipidaemia and renal dysfunction. 6. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Verapamil is the preferred CCB, as it improves diastolic function. 7. Migraine: Verapamil is useful for prophylaxis of migraine. Another CCB, ﬂunarizine, is more effective than verapamil in reducing the frequency of migraine attacks. 8. Raynaud’s phenomenon: It is a peripheral vasospastic condition. Nifedipine, amlodipine, felodipine or diltiazem are used to treat this condition. 9. Nifedipine is used as uterine relaxant in premature labour. 10. Nimodipine is used for prevention and treatment of cerebral vasospasm and subsequent neurological defects in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage.Potassium Channel Openers (Potassium Channel Activator)Nicorandil is administered orally. It causes arteriolar and venodilation, and also improves coronary blood ﬂow. Tolerance does not develop to its actions.

Nitrates /H11003 /H9252-blockers (propranolol): This combination (used in exertional angina) increases the effectiveness and reduces the incidence of adverse effects (Fig. 3.6). (a) Nitrates can counteract the increase in LV end-diastolic volume associated with propranolol. (b) Nitrates n arteriolar dilatation ng PVR n reﬂex tachycardia.

Nifedipine (DHPs) /H11003 /H9252-blockers: /H9252-Blockers can block the reﬂex tachycardia that is associated with nifedipine (Fig. 3.7). Coronary vasospasm by /H9252-blockers is prevented. Slow-acting DHPs are also combined with /H9252-blockers. The combina-tion is useful in classical angina with associated coronary vasospasm. 3. /H9252-Blockers /H11003 verapamil/diltiazem: This combination should not be used as it may cause additive depressant effect on SA node, A V node and cardiac contractil-ity leading to heart block, heart failure or even cardiac arrest. 4. CCBs /H11003 nitrates: The net effect is an additive reduction in the myocardial O2 demand and improved coronary blood ﬂow (Fig. 3.8). This combination is useful in severe variant angina. 5. Nitrates /H11003 /H9252-blockers /H11003 CCBs: This combination is especially useful in severe and resistant cases of exertional angina and also in unstable angina (Fig. 3.9).

Antiplatelet agent: Aspirin, 162 mg or 325 mg orally (chewed and swallowed), is administered at once to a patient with suspected or deﬁnite MI. If the patient is allergic to aspirin, clopidogrel 300 mg is administered. Antiplatelet agent should be continued once daily. 2. Analgesia: Intravenous morphine 10 mg for relief of pain. Antiemetics like promethazine 25–50 mg slow i.v. to prevent opioid-induced vomiting. 3. Nitrates: Intravenous nitroglycerin for recurrent or persistent pain and to treat LV failure. 4. Low ﬂow oxygen therapy (2–4 L/minute) if there is decreased oxygen saturation. 5. Reperfusion therapy: Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or thrombolytic therapy.I Primary PCI, if facilities are available.I Thrombolytic therapy: Streptokinase, alteplase, tenecteplase, reteplase or uro-kinase is used to restore coronary patency and reperfusion of infarcted area. 6. Anticoagulants: Low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin is given to prevent reinfarction and thromboembolic complications. 7. /H9252-Blockers should be administered during ﬁrst 24 hours unless contraindicated. They prevent reinfarction, arrhythmias and reduce mortality. 8. ACE inhibitors (e.g. ramipril) or angiotensin receptor blockers (e.g. valsartan) are administered early to improve survival. 9. Statins (e.g. atorvastatin) should be started (secondary prevention) to reduce thrombotic events and reinfarction. 10. Acidosis is treated with intravenous sodium bicarbonate.Drugs Used in Congestive Cardiac Failure  PH1.29The function of the heart is to pump an adequate amount of blood to various tissues. In CCF, there is an inadequate or inefﬁcient contraction of the heart leading to reduced CO. In initial stages of CCF, the compensatory mechanisms that try to maintain the  CO (Fig. 3.10) are as follows:I Increased sympathetic activity.I Increased renin–angiotensin–aldosterone activity.I Myocardial hypertrophy and remodelling.As time progresses, the compensatory mechanisms fail and gradually clinical symptoms of failure appear. The basic haemodynamic disturbances seen in CCF are as follows:I Increased pulmonary capillary pressure termed as backward failure, which is characterized by dyspnoea and orthopnoea.I Decreased CO termed as forward failure, leading to decreased oxygen supply to the peripheral tissues (tissue hypoxia).The goal of therapy is to provide relief from symptoms, slow the progression of disease and decrease mortality. The treatment strategies for CCF include preload  reduction, afterload reduction and enhancement of contractile state of the heart.

Furosemide is the commonly used loop diuretic. Torsemide and  bumetanide are better absorbed than furosemide. In severe HF, i.v. diuretic is re-quired. Thiazides can be added to loop diuretics in advanced cases of HF for syner-gistic effect. Serum K/H11001 levels should be monitored. Volume contraction should be avoided. Aldosterone antagonist can be added to loop diuretic in moderate to severe HF to increase diuretic efficacy, counteract K/H11001 loss and improve survival. Long-term treatment with diuretics may be required to prevent fluid retention and recurrent oedema.VasodilatorsThe vasodilators may be classiﬁed according to the distribution of their effect: 1. Mixed arteriolar and venodilators: ACE inhibitors, ARBs, sodium nitroprusside, reduce both preload and afterload. 2. Drugs with predominant venodilatory effect (Fig. 3.11): Nitrates reduce preload; they also have some effect on arterioles. 3.

1253—DRUGS AFFECTING CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTIONACE Inhibitors.  They are the standard therapy for all grades of CHF and asymp-tomatic LV systolic dysfunction. They inhibit conversion of angiotensin I to angio-tensin II. ACE inhibitors inhibit the generation of angiotensin II resulting in the  following:I Decrease in peripheral vascular resistance n increase in stroke volume n improved tissue perfusion. Increase in renal blood ﬂow n diuresis ngcirculating blood volume.I Decrease in aldosterone production n decrease in sodium and water retention ng preload.I Venodilation ngpreload.I There is decrease in pressure in atria and pulmonary circuit.I Retard/reverse ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling by decreasing angioten-sin II and aldosterone levels.Therapy with ACEIs leads to symptomatic improvement, decreased hospitaliza-tion and mortality and slowing down of disease progression.For mechanism of action, adverse effects and contraindications, see pp. 100–102.Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (p. 103).  Losartan, candesartan, etc. competitively block AT1-receptors on the heart, peripheral vasculature and kidney. They prevent the effects of angiotensin II and produce effects similar to those of ACE inhibitors. Angiotensin receptor blockers are mainly used in patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors  because of cough, angioedema and neutropenia.Direct Renin Inhibitor.  Aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor, produces a decrease in plasma renin, angiotensin I and II levels. This decreases BP , LV mass and may produce beneﬁcial effects in heart failure.Other vasodilators (Fig. 3.11):Sodium nitroprusside (i.v.) and nitroglycerin (i.v.) are used for severe heart failure. Hydralazine, an arteriolar dilator, increases CO in patients with heart failure. The dis-advantages with the use of arteriolar dilators are reﬂex tachycardia and ﬂuid retention. Tachycardia is rare with mixed arteriolar and venodilators./H9252-Adrenergic Blockers/H9252-Blockers like metoprolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol and nebivolol are useful in mild to moderate heart failure. Long-term therapy with these /H9252-blockers improves symptoms, reduces hospitalization and decreases mortality in patients with mild to moderate heart failure. The exact mechanism of action is not clear. They block  /H9252-receptor–mediated effects of catecholamines on the heart. This improves LV structure and function, decreases wall stress, increases ejection fraction and de-crease LV size. They decrease apoptosis and ventricular remodelling. They also de-crease frequency of arrhythmias. The antioxidant effect of carvedilol also contrib-utes to its beneficial effects. Therapy with /H9252-blockers in heart failure should be under careful supervision.Cardiac GlycosidesChemistry.  The glycosides consist of an aglycone (steroid nucleus with an attached lactone ring) with one or more sugar moieties attached to it. They have a potent action on the heart, hence are referred to as cardiac glycosides. The utility of digitalis in the treatment of heart failure was shown by William Withering.

Digitalis has direct and indirect actions on the heart.I Direct action by inhibiting Na/H11001K/H11001-ATPaseI Indirect action by stimulating vagus (vagomimetic effect) 1. Myocardial contractility: Digitalis increases the force of contraction of the myocardium (positive inotropic effect). This effect is more prominent in  the failing heart. Digitalized heart contracts more forcibly and completely. The positive inotropic effect causes complete emptying of the ventricles during systole and increases the CO. This decreases pulmonary congestion and  systemic venous pressure. The diastolic size of the heart is reduced. When the size of the heart is reduced, muscle ﬁbre length is also reduced, thereby,

Therefore, digitalis is called a ‘cardiotonic’ . 2. Heart rate: In patients with CCF, digitalis reduces the heart rate (negative chronotropic effect) by direct and indirect actions. In small doses, digitalis decreases heart rate by stimulation of vagus. In toxic doses, it can increase sympathetic activity thus increasing heart rate. 3. Electrophysiological actions: At therapeutic concentrations, digoxin decreases automaticity and increases resting membrane potential by vagal action in atria and A V node. It also prolongs ERP and decreases conduction velocity in A V node. This may lead to bradycardia and A V block. At higher concentrations, digoxin can increase automaticity in cardiac tissue by direct action as well as by increasing sympathetic activity. This can result in atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. 4. ECG: Digitalis produces prolongation of P-R interval, inversion of T wave and depression of ST segment.Extracardiac Actions 1. Gastrointestinal tract (GIT): Digitalis can produce anorexia, nausea, vomiting and occasionally diarrhoea. Nausea and vomiting are due to stimulation of che-moreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) and a direct action on the gut. 2. Kidney: In patients with CCF, digitalis causes diuresis (increased urine output). 3. Central nervous system (CNS): In high doses, it can cause central sympathetic stimulation, confusion, blurring of vision, disorientation, etc.Pharmacokinetics.  Digoxin is the commonly used glycoside and is usually adminis-tered by oral route; food delays the absorption of digoxin. It is widely distributed in the body, concentrated in the heart, liver, kidney and skeletal muscle. It crosses BBB and is mainly excreted unchanged in urine. Dosage adjustment of digoxin is necessary in pa-tients with renal failure.Adverse Effects.  Digoxin has a narrow margin of safety. Monitoring of serum digoxin, electrolyte levels and electrocardiogram (ECG) are important during digitalis therapy. 1. Extracardiac (a) GIT: Early symptoms of toxicity are anorexia, nausea and vomiting, which are due to GI irritation and CTZ stimulation.

128PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES (b) CNS effects include headache, confusion, restlessness, disorientation, weak-ness, visual disturbances, altered mood and hallucinations. (c) Skin rashes and gynaecomastia can occur occasionally. 2. Cardiac: Digitalis can cause any type of arrhythmias. The most common are ventricular premature beats, pulsus bigeminy and ventricular tachycardia. It can also cause A V block, atrial tachycardia, atrial ﬁbrillation, atrial ﬂutter and even severe bradycardia.Factors Affecting Digitalis T oxicity 1. Age: Elderly patients are more susceptible to digitalis toxicity due to declining renal and hepatic function. 2. Route: Intravenous digitalization carries more risk than oral route. 3. Hypokalaemia increases the binding of digoxin to Na/H11001K/H11001-ATPase and enhances its toxicity. 4. Hypercalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia enhance digoxin toxicity. 5. Hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypoxia, renal failure and myocarditis are predisposing factors to digitalis toxicity.Treatment of Digoxin T oxicity 1. Shift the patient to intensive care unit (ICU). 2. Stop digoxin and potassium-depleting diuretics (thiazides/loop diuretics). 3. Potassium chloride (KCl) orally or intravenously is the drug of choice for tachyar-rhythmias, when serum K/H11001 level is normal/low. 4. Supraventricular arrhythmias are treated with oral or intravenous propranolol. 5. Intravenous lignocaine is the drug of choice for ventricular arrhythmias because it has:I Relatively low incidence of toxicity.I A rapid onset and short duration of action, so its action wears off immediately after stopping the infusion.I No action on A V nodal conduction velocity, hence, does not intensify the A V block in digitalis toxicity. 6. A V block and bradyarrhythmias are treated with atropine and cardiac pacing. 7. Digoxin antibodies (Digibind): It is used only in case of serious digitalis toxicity. It neutralizes circulating digoxin/digitoxin and rapidly reverses the toxicity, but it is expensive.Drug Interactions 1. Cholestyramine/colestipol /H11003 digoxin: Cholestyramine and colestipol (bile acid binding resins) bind to cardiac glycosides in the gut and reduce its  absorption. 2. /H9252-blocker/verapamil /H11003 digoxin: These drugs have additive depressant effect on SA and A V nodes and may precipitate A V block. 3. Thiazides/loop diuretics /H11003 digoxin: Hypokalaemia caused by diuretics, may potentiate digoxin toxicity. Hypokalaemia increases the binding of digoxin to Na/H11001K/H11001-ATPase. 4. Calcium /H11003 digoxin: Calcium increases the incidence of digoxin toxicity. 5. Digoxin /H11003 sympathomimetic/succinylcholine: The chances of cardiac arrhyth-mias are more with sympathomimetic/succinylcholine in patients on digoxin.

Uses of Digitalis 1. CCF: Digitalis is useful in patients with low output failure, especially when associ-ated with atrial ﬁbrillation. It is ineffective in high output failure associated with severe anaemia, thyrotoxicosis and A V shunt.The beneficial effects of digoxin in case of heart failure are due to its action on myocardium (positive inotropic effect), venous system and kidney  (Fig. 3.13).For explanation, see Pharmacological Actions. 2. Atrial ﬁbrillation: It is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. In atrial ﬁbrilla-tion, the atria beat at a rate of 350–600/minute. Digitalis has both direct and indi-rect (vagomimetic) actions on A V node. It depresses A V node by increasing ERP and decreasing conduction velocity, thus reduces the ventricular rate. Verapamil and propranolol can be used in atrial ﬁbrillation. 3. Atrial ﬂutter: In atrial ﬂutter, the atria beat rapidly at a rate of about 300/minute. Digitalis controls ventricular rate by depressing A V conduction. 4 .  Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT): In PSVT, the heart rate is about 140–220/minute. The preferred drug for PSVT is adenosine. Propranolol or verapamil can also be used. Digoxin has a slower onset of action hence it is not suitable for acute therapy. Digoxin is preferred in PSVT, if there is associated heart failure. It terminates the arrhythmia by increasing the vagal tone.Sympathomimetic AminesDopamine and dobutamine are used in acute heart failure. They have positive inotropic effect and provide symptomatic relief in patients with ventricular dysfunction.Correctshypoxia↑ TissueperfusionDigitalisPositiveinotropiceffect↑ Renalblood flow↑ ↑ COImprovescirculation

130PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESDopamine.  It is a catecholamine and has dose-dependent haemodynamic effects. At low doses (/H110212 mcg/kg/minute), dopamine selectively dilates renal, mesenteric and coronary blood vessels by acting on D1-receptors. Thus, dopamine increases GFR and urine out-put. At moderate doses (2–5 mcg/kg/minute), dopamine stimulates /H92521-receptors of heart, increases myocardial contractility and CO but tachycardia is less prominent.  It also stimulates dopaminergic receptors resulting in an increase in GFR. Dopamine (i.v. infusion) is used in cardiogenic shock and acute heart failure with renal impair-ment. It improves both cardiac and renal function. At high concentration (/H1102210 mcg/kg/minute), it causes generalized vasoconstriction. This increases afterload and reduces blood ﬂow to renal, mesenteric and other vital organs. So the beneﬁcial effects seen with low to moderate doses of dopamine are lost at higher concentrations.Dobutamine.  It is a synthetic catecholamine and acts on /H92521/H11002, /H92522/H11002 and /H92511-receptors. It has selective inotropic effect and increases CO. In therapeutic doses, it has little effect on BP and heart rate. T otal peripheral resistance is generally not affected. This is due to counterbalancing of /H92511-receptor–mediated vasoconstriction and /H92522-receptor–mediated vasodilatation. It is administered by i.v. infusion for short-term treatment of acute heart failure (due to MI or cardiac surgery) and cardiogenic shock. The side effects are tachy-cardia, rise in BP and development of tolerance.Aldosterone AntagonistsIncreased aldosterone levels in CHF causes salt and water retention n increased pre-load; potassium excretion can cause hypokalaemia n increased risk of arrhythmias. Aldosterone also causes ventricular remodelling and hypertrophy. Spironolactone/eplerenone blocks action of aldosterone on its receptor and blocks these effects. They slow disease progression and decrease mortality. They are used in combination with other drugs in moderate to severe heart failure.Phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitorsInamrinone and milrinone are selective phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE-3) inhibitors and  increase cAMP level. They exert both positive inotropic and vasodilator actions (inodila-tors). They are administered intravenously. They increase CO and decrease afterload. They are used for short-term treatment of severe heart failure. The adverse effects of in-amrinone include nausea, vomiting, arrhythmias, thrombocytopenia and hepatotoxicity. Milrinone is more potent than inamrinone and does not produce thrombocytopenia.Vasopressin-Receptor AntagonistsShort-term therapy with tolvaptan may improve symptoms in CHF with volume over-load and severe hyponatraemia.Natriuretic PeptideNesiritide, recombinant form of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), is useful in acute de-compensated heart failure. Dyspnoea is reduced. It is a vasodilator and is administered intravenously. Hypotension is a common adverse effect.SacubitrilIt inhibits neprilysin n inhibits metabolism of ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide) and BNP n vasodilation and diuresis. It is used in combination with valsartan for severe heart failureManagement of CCF include Diet (salt restriction), Diuretics, Dilators (vasodilators–ACEIs, ARBs), Digoxin, Dopamine, Dobutamine, PDE-3 inhibitors, etc. (note the ‘Ds’) and beta-blockers. ACEIs, ARBs, aldosterone antagonists, sacubitril and /H9252-blockers slow

Symptoms of congestion are relieved by vasodilators, diuretics, dobutamine, dopamine, digoxin, milrinone and inamrinone.Antiarrhythmic Drugs  PH1.30CARDIAC ELECTROPHYSIOLOGYThe transmembrane potential of a cardiac cell at rest is about /H1100290 mV negative to the exterior. This is determined mainly by sodium, potassium, calcium and chloride ions.Ionic DistributionNormallyI K/H11001 is more in the intracellular ﬂuid (ICF) than extracellular ﬂuid (ECF).I Na/H11001, Ca2/H11001 and Cl/H11002 are more in the ECF.Cardiac Action PotentialNormally, an impulse is generated in the SA node. From SA node n atria n A V node (slowly) n bundle of His n ventricles.The action potential of Purkinje system has ﬁve phases (Fig. 3.14):I Phase 0 (rapid depolarization): It is mainly due to rapid inﬂux of Na/H11001 through open sodium channels. The upstroke stops following inactivation of sodium channels.I Phase 1 (period of early fast repolarization): It occurs due to stoppage of inward ﬂow of Na/H11001 and start of K/H11001 outﬂow from the cell. It lasts for a brief period.I Phase 2 (plateau phase): During this phase, Ca2/H11001 enters the myocardial cell through voltage-dependent slow Ca2/H11001 channels whereas K/H11001 moves out of the cells through potassium channels.I Phase 3 (phase of repolarization): Calcium channel closes; efﬂux of K/H11001 occurs throughout this phase.I Phase 4 (spontaneous depolarization): The membrane potential returns to the resting value. In the Purkinje ﬁbres, there is spontaneous depolarization.In the SA and A V node, phase 0 is due to slow inﬂow of Ca2/H11001 ions through activated Ca2/H11001 channels. These cells also undergo spontaneous depolarization like Purkinje ﬁbres. Spontaneous depolarization results from depolarizing currents due to ﬂow of Na/H11001, Ca2/H11001 and K/H11001 ions.Ca2+++++++KKKKNaNaTPRPTime (ms)Membranepotential (mV)123440

132PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESIn atria and ventricles, the membrane potential is steady during diastole. The dura-tion of atrial action potential is shorter than that of ventricles.Properties of a Cardiac CellI Automaticity: It is the ability of the cardiac cell to undergo spontaneous depolar-ization. Normally, the rate of spontaneous depolarization is fastest in SA node; hence, it is the pacemaker of the heart.I Excitability: It is the ability of a cell to undergo depolarization in response to a stimulus.I Threshold potential: It is the potential at which sudden, rapid and complete depolarization occurs resulting in the generation of an action potential.I Conduction velocity: It depends mainly on the slope of action potential and phase 0 depolarization.I Effective refractory period (ERP): It is the minimal interval between two successive, propagated action potentials.ARRHYTHMIASArrhythmias are disturbances in cardiac rhythm (i.e. abnormality in site of origin of impulse, its rate, regularity or conduction). Arrhythmias can be either tachyarrhythmias or bradyarrhythmias.I Bradyarrhythmias may be due to reduced automaticity or abnormal slowing/blockade of impulse conduction.I Tachyarrhythmias are due to either increased automaticity, after depolarization or re-entry of an impulse.Various cardiac arrhythmias are atrial ﬂutter, atrial ﬁbrillation, PSVT, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular ﬁbrillation, torsades de pointes, A V block, etc.Drugs used to restore normal rhythm are known as antiarrhythmic drugs.Classiﬁcation of Antiarrhythmic Drugs (Vaughan–Williams)I Class I: Na/H11001 channel blockers (membrane stabilizing agents)I IA: Drugs that moderately depress phase 0 depolarization – quinidine, procain-amide, disopyramide.I IB: Drugs that have minimal effect on phase 0 depolarization – lignocaine, mexiletine.I IC: Drugs that markedly depress phase 0 depolarization – ﬂecainide, propafenone.I Class II (/H9252-adrenergic blockers): Propranolol, atenolol, esmolol, metoprolol, sotalol.I Class III (drugs that prolong duration of action potential): Amiodarone, dronedarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide, bretylium.I Class IV (CCBs): Verapamil, diltiazem.Other antiarrhythmic agents are digoxin, adenosine, atropine, isoprenaline, etc.Class I: Na/H11001 Channel BlockersQuinidine.  It is a class IA antiarrhythmic drug. It is an alkaloid obtained from cin-chona bark.Pharmacological Actions of Quinidine 1. Cardiovascular system (a) Heart:I Quinidine blocks Na/H11001 channels in the open state n decreases automatic-ity, excitability, rate of phase 0 depolarization and conduction velocity.

1333—DRUGS AFFECTING CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTIONI It blocks potassium channels n increases duration of action potential.I It prolongs ERP as a result of blockade of both Na/H11001 and K/H11001 channels.It suppresses ectopic foci and blocks re-entry of impulses. (b) A V node: Effect on A V node conduction is variable. It has vagolytic (increases A V node conduction) and direct depressant action on A V node. (c) ECG: Quinidine prolongs QRS complex and QT interval. (d) BP: Quinidine causes fall in blood pressure due to /H9251-adrenergic blocking and direct myocardial depressant effects. 2. Skeletal muscles: Quinidine reduces skeletal muscle contraction. 3. Others: It also has antimalarial, antipyretic and oxytocic activities.Pharmacokinetics.  Quinidine is well absorbed from GI tract, highly bound to plasma proteins, metabolized in liver, and about 20% is excreted unchanged in urine.Adverse Effects.  The important adverse effects are diarrhoea, thrombocytopenia and fall in BP and torsades de pointes. Hepatitis and fever can rarely occur. Large doses of quinidine may produce a syndrome called ‘cinchonism’ . The manifestations are tinnitus, deafness, headache, blurring of vision, diplopia, photophobia, confusion, delirium, dis-orientation and psychosis.Drug Interactions 1. Quinidine may potentiate the effects of neuromuscular blocking drugs. 2. Quinidine /H11003 /H9252-blockers/verapamil/potassium salts: Additive cardiac depressant effect may lead to cardiac arrest.Uses.  Quinidine has a broad spectrum of antiarrhythmic activity but it is not the drug of choice in any type of arrhythmias. Its use has declined because of its adverse effects and availability of better antiarrhythmic drugs. It is useful in maintaining normal sinus rhythm in patients with atrial ﬁbrillation or atrial ﬂutter and occasionally to treat ventricular tachycardia.Procainamide.  Like quinidine, procainamide is also a class IA antiarrhythmic drug. Its effects are similar to those of quinidine but it has no anticholinergic and /H9251-adrenergic blocking effects.Pharmacokinetics.  Procainamide is well absorbed after oral administration. It can also be given by i.v. and i.m. routes. It is metabolized in liver by acetylation. The major  metabolite is N-acetyl procainamide (NAPA) that has K/H11001 channel–blocking activity. NAPA is excreted in urine; hence dosage adjustment may be needed in patients with renal failure.Adverse Effects 1. CVS: Hypotension (due to ganglion blockade) and heart block are the main ad-verse effects following i.v. administration. Torsades de pointes can also occur. 2. GIT: Nausea and vomiting. 3. CNS: Mental confusion, depression, hallucinations and psychosis. Long-term procain-amide therapy often produces lupus-like syndrome with arthralgia and arthritis.Uses.  It is useful in ventricular arrhythmias associated with acute MI. It is not used for long-term oral therapy due to need for frequent dosing and risk of lupus syndrome.Disopyramide.  It is a class IA antiarrhythmic drug. Its actions are similar to those of quinidine but it has more marked anticholinergic action.Pharmacokinetics.  Disopyramide is well absorbed after oral administration. It is partly metabolized in liver and partly excreted in urine in the unchanged form.Uses.  Disopyramide is mainly used for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. It can also be used to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with atrial ﬁbrillation or atrial ﬂutter.

134PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESAdverse Effects.  Anticholinergic side effects are urinary retention especially in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), dryness of mouth, blurring of vision, constipation, pre-cipitation of an attack of glaucoma, etc.Lignocaine.  Lignocaine is a local anaesthetic having antiarrhythmic activity. It is a class IB antiarrhythmic drug. Local anaesthetic preparation of lignocaine contains meth-ylparaben, a preservative, hence not used as antiarrhythmic agent.Pharmacological Actions.  It blocks sodium channels in the inactivated (predomi-nantly) and the active states. It has minimal effect on normal cardiac tissues. Its effect is prominent in depolarized (ischaemic) tissues. It decreases automaticity of ectopic foci by reducing the slope of phase 4 depolarization and depresses conduction in  depolarized (diseased) tissue. Action potential duration is usually unaffected or may be shortened.Pharmacokinetics.  Lignocaine is orally not effective because of extensive ﬁrst-pass metabolism. Lignocaine is, therefore, commonly administered by intravenous route as an antiarrhythmic. It is widely distributed in the body, readily crosses BBB, is poorly bound to plasma proteins, rapidly metabolized in liver and has short plasma half-life of 1–2 hours. The volume of distribution and hepatic clearance of lignocaine are reduced in patients with heart failure; hence, both the loading and maintenance dose should be decreased. In hepatic disease, the clearance of lignocaine is reduced; hence, it requires a reduction in the maintenance dose.Drug Interactions.  Lignocaine /H11003 propranolol: Propranolol reduces lignocaine elimi-nation by reducing the hepatic blood ﬂow, thus increases the risk of lignocaine toxicity.Adverse Effects.  These are mainly related to the central nervous system – headache, drowsiness, nystagmus, blurred vision, confusion, muscle twitchings and convulsions. In high doses, lignocaine may cause hypotension due to myocardial depression. Side effects are potentiated in renal and hepatic failure.UsesI Lignocaine is used for emergency treatment of ventricular arrhythmias associated with MI, digitalis toxicity and cardiac surgery.I Lignocaine is preferred in ventricular arrhythmias because it:I Is relatively less toxic.I Has a rapid onset and short duration of action, so its action wears off immedi-ately after stopping the infusion.I Has no action on A V nodal conduction velocity, hence does not intensify the A V block during treatment of ventricular arrhythmias in digitalis toxicity.I Lignocaine is administered intravenously initially as bolus 1–2 mg/kg and later 1–4 mg/minute i.v. infusion as maintenance dose.I Lignocaine is not useful in atrial arrhythmias because atrial action potentials are of very short duration – so the Na/H11001 channels are in the inactivated state for a very brief period of time.Mexiletine.  It is an analogue of lignocaine and has similar actions. It is used orally and parenterally in the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. The common adverse effects are nausea, dizziness and tremors.Flecainide and Propafenone.  These are class IC antiarrhythmic drugs. They block so-dium channels in the open state. Class IC drugs have the most potent blocking effect on sodium channels. They markedly depress phase 0 depolarization, slow conduction and prolong PR interval. Propafenone also blocks /H9252 receptors.

1353—DRUGS AFFECTING CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTIONAdverse Effects.  Both the drugs can exacerbate arrhythmias and CCF. Other adverse effects seen with propafenone are metallic taste, constipation, bradycardia and broncho-spasm. Blurring of vision is common with ﬂecainide.Uses.  Propafenone and ﬂecainide are primarily used for the treatment of supraven-tricular arrhythmias; can also be used in ventricular arrhythmias. Both the drugs are administered orally.Class II: /H9252-Blockers.  Propranolol, atenolol, esmolol, metoprolol, etc. are class II antiar-rhythmic agents. They block the effects of catecholamines on the heart. They:I Depress the phase 4 depolarization – decrease automaticity in SA node and ectopic foci (when increased by adrenergic stimulation).I Prolong the refractory period and decrease the conduction velocity in A V node which makes them useful:I In the treatment of re-entrant arrhythmias involving the A V node (PSVT).I T o control ventricular rate in atrial ﬂutter and atrial ﬁbrillation.In high doses, propranolol has ‘quinidine-like’ membrane stabilizing effect.Pharmacokinetics, adverse effects and contraindications are discussed on pp. 93–95.Esmolol.  It is a cardioselective /H92521-blocker with a rapid onset and short duration of ac-tion. Intravenous esmolol is used for emergency control of ventricular rate in atrial ﬂutter and atrial ﬁbrillation. Intravenous esmolol is also highly effective for terminating an attack of PSVT. Side effects are hypotension, dizziness and bronchospasm in asthmatics.Sotalol.  It is a nonselective /H9252-adrenergic blocker with additional K/H11001 channel–blocking (class III) property, thus prolonging the duration of action potential. It decreases automa-ticity, slows A V conduction and prolongs ERP . Sotalol is used to treat life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias and to maintain sinus rhythm in atrial ﬁbrillation. Adverse effects and contraindications are same as propranolol. Sotalol can cause torsades de pointes.Class III: Drugs that Prolong Duration of Action PotentialAmiodarone.  It is an iodine-containing compound and structurally related to thyroid hormone. It has a broad spectrum of antiarrhythmic activity.I Amiodarone blocks potassium channels n increases duration of action potential n prolongs refractory period and suppresses abnormal automaticity (Fig. 3.15).I Blocks sodium channels in the inactivated state n decreases conduction mainly in the partially depolarized tissue.I Blockade of sodium and potassium channels prolongs refractory period in the cardiac tissue.I It also has weak /H9252-adrenergic blocking and calcium channel–blocking actions. It decreases heart rate and A V conduction.KKK123440Prolong PHASE-3repolarizationProlong theduration ofaction potential+++K channel blockers+Fig. 3.15 Mechanism of action of amiodarone and other class III drugs.

136PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESPharmacokinetics.  Following oral administration, bioavailability is about 30%. It can be given intravenously for rapid effect. It accumulates in fat, muscle, lungs, liver, skin, etc. and has a long half-life (1–2 months). Amiodarone is metabolized in the liver.Uses.  Amiodarone has a broad spectrum of antiarrhythmic actions with a low inci-dence of torsades de pointes. It is effective in the treatment of atrial and ventricular ar-rhythmias. It is used to maintain normal sinus rhythm in atrial ﬁbrillation and prevent recurrent ventricular tachycardia.Adverse Effects 1. CVS: Hypotension (due to vasodilation), CHF and exacerbation of arrhythmias. 2. Neurological: Peripheral neuropathy. 3. Respiratory: Pulmonary ﬁbrosis. 4. GIT: Nausea and hepatitis. 5. Photosensitivity and pigmentation of the skin. 6. Eye: Corneal deposits. 7. Thyroid: Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism; hence TSH, T3 and T4 levels should be monitored during long-term therapy with amiodarone.(Note the ‘Ps’ .)Drug Interactions.  Amiodarone /H11003 /H9252-blockers/verapamil: Additive depressant action on SA and A V node lead to SA block and A V block, respectively.Amiodarone inhibits the renal clearance of digoxin, thereby increases serum digoxin levels.It also increases concentration of quinidine and procainamide. Amiodarone potenti-ates the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.Note: Amiodarone is a broad-spectrum antiarrhythmic agent with long half-life, causes multiple effects, may cause wide range of adverse effects, but does not require dose adjustment in patients with hepatic or renal disease.Dofetilide and ibutilide are pure potassium channel blockers. They are useful in main-taining normal sinus rhythm in atrial ﬁbrillation.Class IV: Calcium Channel BlockersVerapamil.  It blocks both activated and inactivated L-type Ca2/H11001 channels – depresses calcium-mediated depolarization. V erapamil decreases conduction velocity and increases refractory period of A V node; useful inI T erminating re-entry involving A V node (PSVT)I Reducing ventricular rate in atrial ﬂutter and ﬁbrillationIt decreases slope of phase 4 depolarization in the SA node (bradycardia) and in the ectopic foci.Pharmacokinetics, adverse effects, drug interactions and uses are discussed on  pp. 117-119.Diltiazem.  All features are similar to verapamil but it is comparatively less potent than verapamil.Miscellaneous AgentsAdenosine.  It is a purine nucleoside that is administered as a rapid i.v. bolus for rapid control of PSVT. The duration of action of adenosine is less than 1 minute because it is rapidly transported into red blood corpuscles (RBCs) and endothelial cells.

It is the preferred drug for rapid termination of PSVT because it has: (1) High efﬁcacy. (2) A short duration of action – adverse effects last for brief period. (3) Minimal negative inotropic action.Adverse Effects and Disadvantages.  These include Asystole, Bronchospasm, Chest pain, Dyspnoea, Expensive, Flushing, Hypotension and Headache. Side effects are transient due to its short duration of action.Drug Interactions.  Adenosine /H11003 methylxanthines: Methylxanthines antagonize the effects of adenosine by blocking its receptors.Adenosine /H11003 dipyridamole: Dipyridamole inhibits uptake of adenosine into cells and potentiates its actions.Magnesium.  Intravenous magnesium sulphate is useful in torsades de pointes (even if serum magnesium levels are normal). It can be used in digitalis-induced arrhythmias if there is hypomagnesaemia.Atropine.  It is used in the treatment of bradycardia and A V block due to vagal overac-tivity (e.g. acute MI and digitalis toxicity). It has vagolytic action.Isoprenaline.  Intravenous isoprenaline can be used in second degree or complete heart block following acute MI.Some of the important drugs used in different types of cardiac arrhythmias are listed in Table 3.6.

The plasma lipoproteins are chylomicrons, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), inter-mediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density  lipoprotein (HDL). The HDL transports excess cholesterol from the peripheral tissues to liver for excretion in bile. In hyperlipoproteinaemias, the concentration of lipopro-teins in plasma is elevated.Normal plasma lipid levels (mg/dL)T otal cholesterol  /H11021200LDL cholesterol  /H11021100HDL cholesterol    M e n   /H1102240  W o m e n   /H1102250Triglycerides  /H11021150Hyperlipoproteinaemias may be primary (genetically determined) or secondary to diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, chronic renal disease, chronic alcoholism and drugs (/H9252-blockers, corticosteroids, diuretics, oral contraceptives, etc.).Classiﬁcation of Hypolipidaemic Drugs 1 .  HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase inhibitors (statins): Atorvastatin, pravastatin, pitavastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin. 2. Fibric acid derivatives: Gemﬁbrozil, fenoﬁbrate, bezaﬁbrate, cloﬁbrate. 3. Bile acid–binding resins: Cholestyramine, colestipol, colesevelam. 4. Inhibitor of triglyceride production and lipolysis: Nicotinic acid. 5. Dietary cholesterol absorption inhibitor: Ezetimibe.

Others: Gugulipid, omega-3 fatty acids.HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (Statins)Statins are the most effective agents for treating hyperlipidaemias. They include rosuv-astatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, pitavastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin.Mechanism of Action.  Statins competitively inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis (i.e. the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate). This results in a decrease in blood LDL and VLDL levels. gCholesterol synthesis nh LDL receptors in the liver nh LDL uptake and degradation. Thus, statins are very effective in reducing plasma LDL levels. They also reduce triglycerides (TGs) and increase HDL-cholesterol levels in plasma. Statins (those with short half-life) are usually given once daily in the evening because choles-terol biosynthesis occurs mainly at night. Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin have long half-life.HMG–CoAMevalonateCholesterolHMG–CoA reductase−StatinsAmong statins, lovastatin and simvastatin are prodrugs and are converted to their active forms in the liver. All statins undergo extensive ﬁrst-pass metabolism in liver and most of the absorbed dose is excreted in bile. Pitavastatin is the most potent statin.Other actions of statins – atherosclerotic plaque stability, antioxidant and antiinﬂam-matory actions; decrease platelet aggregation; increase production of NO by endothe-lium. These actions also contribute to the cardioprotective effects of statins.Adverse Effects* 1. Hepatotoxicity (dose related) with increase in serum transaminase levels. 2. Headache and sleep disturbances. 3. Myopathy: Muscle pain and weakness with raised plasma creatinine kinase activ-ity. Rhabdomyolysis may occur. 4. Gastrointestinal: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.Statins should not be taken in pregnancy.Uses.  Statins are the commonly used drugs for treatment of primary hyperlipidaemias with increased LDL and cholesterol levels. They are also used in secondary hyperlipidae-mias due to diabetes or nephrotic syndrome.Drug interactions.  Statins /H11003 cyclosporine/erythromycin/azoles: They inhibit the me-tabolism of statins (except pravastatin) n increased blood levels of statins n increased incidence of myopathy.Bile Acid–Binding Resins (Bile Acid Sequestrants)They are cholestyramine, colestipol and colesevelam.In the liver, cholesterol is converted to bile acidsTransported to intestineReabsorption of bile acids in intestineLiver(enterohepatic cycling)*Mnemonic for adverse effects of statins – HMG

140PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESResins bind bile acids in the gut and interrupt their enterohepatic circulation, thus promote conversion of cholesterol to bile acids in the liver. They also stimulate the  formation of hepatic LDL-receptors which take up more LDL-cholesterol from the  circulation. The net effect is reduction of LDL levels with little effect on HDL level.Uses.  Resins are used in the treatment of primary hypercholesterolaemia. Resins should be taken orally with water or fruit juice before meals. They are also useful to  relieve itching of obstructive jaundice.Adverse Effects.  Since resins are not absorbed through the gut, systemic adverse effects are not seen. The common adverse effects are unpalatability, bloating, nausea, ﬂatulence and constipation. They also bind to other drugs (thiazides, digitalis, anticoagulants, pro-pranolol, thyroxine, fat-soluble vitamins, etc.) in the gut and reduce their absorption.Fibrates (Fibric Acid Derivatives)Some of the ﬁbrates are cloﬁbrate, gemﬁbrozil, bezaﬁbrate and fenoﬁbrate.They activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor /H9251 (PPAR-/H9251) present in the liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle.Mechanism of Action
↓ Plasma TG  levelsFibratesActivate PPAR-α↑ Lipoprotein lipase  synthesis and activity ↑ Clearance of  VLDL •↑ LDL receptors in the liver•↑ LDL uptake and degradation ↑ Fatty acidoxidation↓ TG levels↑ HDL levels
Fibrates also inhibits TG synthesis in liver. Fibrates are well absorbed after oral admin-istration, widely distributed and concentrated in liver, kidney and intestine; metabolized in liver and excreted in urine.Uses.  Fibrates are very effective in type III hyperlipoproteinaemia and severe hypertri-glyceridaemia.Adverse Effects.  Fibrates are usually well tolerated. The common side effects are dys-pepsia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, muscle pain and headache. There is an increased incidence of gallstones with cloﬁbrate. Fibrates can potentiate the effect of warfarin and oral hypoglycaemic drugs. Use of combination of gemﬁbrozil with statins increases the risk of myopathy. (Fenoﬁbrate/bezaﬁbrate can be combined with statins.) Fibrates are contraindicated in pregnancy.Nicotinic Acid (Niacin)Niacin is a B-complex vitamin. In larger doses, it has hypolipidaemic effect; it reduces plasma TGs, VLDL, LDL, and increases HDL levels. Lipoprotein(a) is decreased.

In liverIn adipose tissueNiacin−TriglyceridesFree fatty acidsVLDL↑ Hydrolysis ofVLDL↑ Lipoprotein lipaseactivity↓ VLDL andTG levelsNiacin inhibits lipolysis in adipose tissue, thus reduces hepatic TG and VLDL synthe-sis. Niacin is the most effective agent for increasing HDL level. It should be started at a low dose and taken with meals to delay absorption. Niacin is mainly used in patients with both hypertriglyceridaemia and low HDL levels.Adverse Effects.  The main adverse effects are ﬂushing and dyspepsia. Flushing (pros-taglandin-mediated vasodilation) can be reduced either by combining niacin with aspirin or starting with a low dose of niacin. The other side effects are itching, headache, hyper-pigmentation, peptic ulcer, hyperuricaemia, hepatotoxicity, hyperglycaemia and rarely atrial arrhythmias. Niacin may potentiate the effects of warfarin. It is contraindicated in pregnancy.Ezetimibe (Cholesterol Absorption Inhibitor)It inhibits the absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol in the intestine. It reduces LDL cholesterol.Uses.  Ezetimibe is mainly used with a statin, when the LDL levels are not controlled with statin monotherapy. The combination of ezetimibe and statins has a beneﬁcial ef-fect. Statins inhibit cholesterol synthesis but increase intestinal cholesterol absorption. Ezetimibe inhibits intestinal cholesterol absorption but increases cholesterol synthesis. Combined use of these drugs prevents the increase in cholesterol absorption caused by statins and increased cholesterol synthesis caused by ezetimibe. The combination pro-duces an additive reduction in LDL cholesterol levels.HMG CoA reductase StatinsHMG CoALiverIntestineMevalonateCholesterolCholesterolEzetimibe/H17054/H17054Adverse Effects.  There is a low incidence of hepatic dysfunction with ezetimibe.Monoclonal antibodies: Alirocumab and evolocumab inhibit antibodies to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), thus increasing hepatic clearance of LDL and lower plasma LDL levels. They are used as adjunct to statin therapy. They are administered parenterally; should be avoided in pregnancy and lactating mother.

142PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESOmega-3 Fatty AcidsThey are effective in the treatment of hypertriglyceridaemia. They are present in ﬁsh oils. Omega-3 fatty acids activate PPAR-/H9251 and reduce triglyceride levels. Nausea and belching may occur.Plasma Volume Expanders  PH1.25Plasma volume expanders are solutions used for temporary maintenance of blood vol-ume in emergency situations. Colloidal solutions are commonly used as plasma expand-ers. Colloidal solutions have a high-molecular weight and exert a high oncotic pressure. The important colloidal solutions are human albumin, dextran, polyvinylpyrrolidone, hetastarch and degraded gelatin polymer.Requirements of an Ideal Plasma Expander 1. The oncotic pressure, pH and viscosity of the solution should be same as that of plasma. 2. It should be retained in the circulation for an adequate period. 3. It should be nonpyrogenic and nonantigenic. 4. It should be stable and cheap. 5. It should not interfere with blood grouping and cross-matching of blood.HUMAN ALBUMINAlbumin and plasma protein fraction, which are prepared from pooled human plasma are the commonly used plasma expanders. About 25 g of 5% albumin is osmotically equivalent to about 500 mL of fresh frozen plasma. This is valuable to restore colloidal osmotic pressure in hypovolaemic states, such as burns, haemorrhage and surgical pro-cedures. There is no risk of hepatitis B/hepatitis C/HIV infections. It can cause hyper-sensitivity and overloading of circulation. Plasma protein fraction contains globulin in addition to albumin.DEXTRANDextran is a water-soluble glucose polymer produced by bacteria grown on sucrose media. It is available as dextran 40 and dextran 70. Dextrans increase plasma colloidal oncotic pressure similar to that of plasma proteins.Dextran 40.  It is given by i.v. infusion as a 10% solution. It acts rapidly but has a relatively transient effect. It reduces blood viscosity and inhibits sludging of RBCs in small blood vessels. It also improves microcirculation.Dextran 70.  It is infused as a 6% solution and is preferred when small volumes are required. It produces less expansion of plasma volume than dextran 40. It has a longer duration of action because of its slow renal excretion. It also reduces blood viscosity and inhibits sludging of RBCs.Dextrans may induce rouleaux formation and this interferes with blood grouping and cross-matching. They can interfere with platelet function and coagulation. The adverse effects of dextran are hypersensitivity, fever, joint pain, urticaria, hypotension, bronchospasm and rarely anaphylactic reaction. The anticoagulant effect of heparin may be enhanced by dextran.

1433—DRUGS AFFECTING CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTIONHYDROXYETHYL STARCH OR HETASTARCHIt is derived from starch. It acts by increasing oncotic effect similar to that of plasma albumin. It is stable at room temperature and has a long duration of action. Hetastarch has also been used to improve granulocyte harvesting during leukapheresis procedures. It does not interfere with blood grouping and cross-matching of blood. The adverse ef-fects are ﬂu-like syndrome (headache, fever and myalgia), itching, urticaria and anaphy-lactoid reactions.DEGRADED GELATIN POLYMERGelatin is a polypeptide obtained from ox collagen. Gelatin in degraded form is  used commonly as a plasma expander. It exerts oncotic pressure similar to that of  albumin. Plasma expansion lasts for about 12 hours. It does not interfere with  blood grouping and cross-matching of blood. Gelatin has also been used as a  haemostatic in surgical procedures. It can cause ﬂushing, itching, urticaria, broncho-spasm and hypotension. Severe reactions can occur with urea-linked gelatin, e.g.  Haemaccel.POLYVINYLPYRROLIDONEThis is a synthetic polymer. It interferes with blood grouping and cross-matching of blood. It binds to drugs such as insulin and penicillin in circulation and reduces their effect. It is rarely used now.Uses of Plasma Expanders.  They are used to maintain circulating volume in burns, haemorrhage, severe trauma, etc. when blood/plasma is not readily available.Contraindications.  They are severe anaemia, bleeding disorders, CHF, renal failure and hepatic failure.

151CHAPTER 4Renal PharmacologyKidney is mainly a regulatory organ; it also has excretory function. The functional unit of kidney is nephron. Each kidney contains about 1 million nephrons. The functions of kidney are as follows: 1. Regulatory: Acid–base, ﬂuid and electrolyte balance. 2. Excretory: Excretion of nitrogenous waste products. 3. Hormonal: Activation of vitamin D, production of renin and erythropoietin.Mechanism of Urine Formation  PH1.24It consists of the following steps 1. Glomerular ﬁltration 2. Tubular reabsorption 3. Active tubular secretionUrine formation begins with glomerular ﬁltration. The volume of ﬂuid ﬁltered is about 180 L/day, of which more than 99% gets reabsorbed in the renal tubules; urine output is about 1–1.5 L/day. After ﬁltration, ﬂuid traverses in the renal tubules. The tubular ﬂuid contains Na/H11001, K/H11001, Cl/H11002, HCO3/H11002, amino acids, glucose, etc.PROXIMAL CONVOLUTED TUBULE: SITE 1 (Fig. 4.1)Most of the ﬁltered Na/H11001 is actively reabsorbed; chloride is reabsorbed passively along with sodium. Carbonic anhydrase plays an important role in the reabsorption of bicar-bonate and secretion of H/H11001. The Na/H11001–H/H11001 exchanger in the proximal tubular cells trans-ports Na/H11001 from the lumen into the cell and H/H11001 from the cell into the tubular ﬂuid. Potassium, glucose, amino acids, etc. are also reabsorbed in proximal convoluted tubule (PCT). Proportionately, water also gets reabsorbed, so tubular ﬂuid in the PCT remains isotonic.DESCENDING LIMB OF LOOP OF HENLEThe descending limb is impermeable to Na/H11001 and urea and highly permeable to water. Hence, ﬂuid in this segment becomes hypertonic.THICK ASCENDING LIMB OF LOOP OF HENLE: SITE 2 (Fig. 4.1)The thick ascending limb is impermeable to water but highly permeable to Na/H11001 and Cl/H11002. Active reabsorption of sodium and chloride occurs by Na/H11001–K/H11001–2Cl/H11002 cotransporter. This is selectively blocked by loop diuretics. Ca2/H11001 and Mg2/H11001 are also reabsorbed at this site. The tubular ﬂuid becomes hypotonic.

This is blocked by thiazides.LATE DISTAL TUBULE AND COLLECTING DUCT: SITE 4 (Fig. 4.1)Sodium is actively reabsorbed; chloride and water diffuse passively. Exchange of  Na/H11001–K/H11001, H/H11001 ions occur. The Na/H11001–K/H11001 exchange is under the inﬂuence of aldosterone (aldosterone promotes Na/H11001 absorption and K/H11001 depletion). Absorption of water in col-lecting duct (CD) is under the inﬂuence of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). In the absence of ADH, the CD becomes impermeable to water and a large amount of dilute urine is excreted. Normally, H/H11001 ions present in urine convert NH3 to NH4/H11001, which is excreted.Diuretics  PH1.24Diuretics are drugs that promote excretion of Na/H11001 and water in urine.CLASSIFICATION ACCORDING TO PRIMARY SITE OF ACTION IN THE NEPHRON (Fig. 4.1) 1.

Drugs acting on entire nephron (main site of action is loop of Henle)Osmotic diuretics: Mannitol, glycerol, isosorbide.Carbonic Anhydrase InhibitorsMechanism of Action.  CO2 a n d  H2O from the tubular lumen diffuse into tubular cell where H2CO3 is formed under the inﬂuence of carbonic anhydrase (Fig. 4.2). Carbonic acid (H2CO3) dissociates into H/H11001 a n d  H C O3/H11002. The bicarbonate ions are transported into the interstitium. The H/H11001 ions exchange with luminal Na/H11001 (Na/H11001–H/H11001 antiporter). In the lumen, H/H11001 ions combine with the ﬁltered HCO3/H11002 to form H2CO3. The H2CO3 dissociates into CO2 and H2O with the help of carbonic anhydrase, which is present near the brush border. The main site of action of acetazolamide is proximal tubule (site 1); it also acts in the CD.  Acetazolamide, by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase enzyme, prevents the formation of H/H11001 ions. Thus, Na/H11001–H/H11001 exchange is prevented. Na/H11001 is excreted along with HCO3/H11002 in urine.In the DCT, increased Na/H11001–K/H11001 exchange leads to loss of K/H11001. The net effect is loss of Na/H11001, K/H11001 and HCO3/H11002 in urine resulting in alkaline urine.Uses.  Acetazolamide is not used as diuretic because of its low efﬁcacy. It is used in the following: 1. Glaucoma: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors decrease intraocular pressure (IOP) by reducing the formation of aqueous humour. Acetazolamide is used in acute con-gestive glaucoma by oral and i.v. routes. T opical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (dorzolamide and brinzolamide) are used in chronic simple glaucoma (see p. 58). 2. T o alkalinize urine in acidic drug poisoning. 3. Acute mountain sickness: Acetazolamide can be used both for symptomatic relief and prophylaxis of acute mountain sickness. It is better to administer it prophy-lactically. The beneﬁcial effect may be due to a decrease in pH and formation of cerebrospinal ﬂuid.Tubular fluid Tubular cell

These include hypersensitivity reactions (skin rashes, fever, nephritis, etc.), drowsiness, paraesthesia, hypokalaemia, metabolic acidosis, headache and renal stones.Contraindications 1. Liver disease: Hepatic coma may be precipitated in patients with cirrhosis due to decreased excretion of NH3 in alkaline urine. 2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): Worsening of metabolic acido-sis is seen in patients with COPD.Osmotic DiureticsThese include mannitol, glycerol and isosorbide.Mannitol: Mannitol is administered intravenously. It is neither metabolized in the body nor signiﬁcantly reabsorbed from the renal tubules. It is pharmacologically inert and is freely ﬁltered at the glomerulus.Glycerol: Glycerol can be used orally to reduce IOP in acute congestive glaucoma.Mechanism of Action.  Osmotic diuretics draw water from tissues by osmotic action. This results in increased excretion of water and electrolytes. Their site of action is in the loop of Henle and proximal tubule.

1554—RENAL PHARMACOLOGYUses of Osmotic Diuretics 1. Mannitol is used to reduce the elevated intracranial tension (ICT) following head injury or tumour. It draws ﬂuid from the brain into the circulation by osmotic effect, thus lowering ICT. 2. Mannitol 20% (i.v.), glycerol 50% (oral) and isosorbide (oral) are used to reduce the elevated IOP in acute congestive glaucoma. They draw ﬂuid from the eye, by osmotic effect, into blood – IOP is decreased. 3. Mannitol is used to prevent acute renal shutdown in shock, cardiovascular sur-gery, haemolytic transfusion reactions, etc. 4. Mannitol is useful to maintain the osmolality of ECF after dialysis.Adverse Effects 1. T oo rapid and too much quantity of i.v. mannitol can cause marked expansion of ECF volume which can lead to pulmonary oedema. 2. Headache, nausea and vomiting may occur. 3. Glycerol can cause hyperglycaemia.Contraindications.  Mannitol is contraindicated in congestive cardiac failure (CCF) and pulmonary oedema because it expands ECF volume by increasing the osmolality of extracellular compartment and increases the load on heart, thus, aggravating the above condition. Other contraindications are chronic oedema, anuric renal disease, active  intracranial bleeding and acute tubular necrosis.Loop Diuretics (High-Ceiling Diuretics)The important loop diuretics are furosemide, bumetanide and torsemide.Mechanism of Action (Fig. 4.3).  Site of action is the thick ascending limb of loop of Henle (site 2). Loop diuretics bind to luminal side of Na/H11001–K/H11001–2Cl/H11002 cotransporter and block its function. There is an increased excretion of Na/H11001 a n d  C l/H11002 in urine. The tubular ﬂuid reaching DCT contains large amount of Na/H11001. Hence, more Na/H11001 exchanges with K/H11001, leading to K/H11001 loss. Furosemide has weak carbonic anhydrase–inhibiting activity, hence, increases the excretion of HCO3/H11002. Loop diuretics also increase the excretion of Ca2/H11001 and Mg2/H11001.Tubular fluid Interstitium–blood Tubular cellCl–Cl–Cl–Na+K+, Na+Na+, K+K+   potential in           lumen)  Loop diuretics cotransporter(positive          –

156PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESLoop diuretics are called high-ceiling diuretics because they are highly efﬁcacious – have maximal Na/H11001 excreting capacity when compared to thiazides and potassium-sparing diuretics.The loop diuretics are rapidly absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract. Furose-mide and bumetanide are administered by oral, i.v. and i.m. routes. T orsemide is given orally and intramuscularly. Furosemide has a rapid onset of action within 2–5 minutes of i.v.; 10–20 minutes after i.m. and 30–40 minutes after oral administration. The  duration of action of furosemide is short (2–4 hours).Bumetanide and TorsemideI Can be administered orally and parenterally.I Are more potent than furosemide.I Have better oral bioavailability than furosemide.I T orsemide: Longer half-life than others.Therapeutic Uses of Loop Diuretics 1. During the initial stages of renal and cardiac oedema, loop diuretics are preferred. They are also useful in hepatic oedema – vigorous diuresis should be avoided to prevent hepatic coma. 2. Intravenous furosemide, along with isotonic saline (to prevent volume depletion), is used in hypercalcaemia as it promotes the excretion of Ca2/H11001 in urine. 3. Acute pulmonary oedema – loop diuretics act in the following way:Intravenous furosemide↑ PG synthesis and release↑ Renal blood  ﬂow↑ Systemic venous capacitance due to vasodilationResults in shift of blood from central pulmonary to systemic vessels, ↓ left ventricular ﬁlling pressureProduces quick relief from pulmonary oedema 4. Loop diuretics may be used in cerebral oedema but i.v. mannitol is the preferred drug. 5. Hypertension: Loop diuretics can be used in hypertension associated with CCF/renal failure and in hypertensive emergencies. Furosemide is not preferred in  uncomplicated primary hypertension because of its short duration of action. 6 .

Electrolyte disturbances are the common adverse effects seen with loop diuretics. They are as follows: (a) Hypokalaemia: It is the most important adverse effect. It can cause fatigue, muscular weakness and cardiac arrhythmias. Hypokalaemia can be prevented by using a combination of loop diuretic with potassium-sparing diuretic. It can be treated by K/H11001 supplementation. (b) Hyponatraemia: Loop diuretics can cause depletion of sodium from the body.

1574—RENAL PHARMACOLOGY (c) Hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia: These are due to the increased urinary excretion of Ca2/H11001 and Mg2/H11001, respectively. Hypomagnesaemia can predispose to cardiac arrhythmias. 2. The metabolic disturbances include: (a) Hyperglycaemia: This can occur due to decreased insulin secretion. (b) Hyperuricaemia: These drugs decrease the renal excretion of uric acid and may precipitate attack of gout. (c) Hyperlipidaemia: They increase plasma triglycerides and LDL cholesterol levels. 3. Ototoxicity manifests as deafness, vertigo and tinnitus and is due to damage to hair cells in inner ear. The symptoms are usually reversible on stoppage of therapy. The risk of ototoxicity is increased in patients with renal impairment and in those receiving other ototoxic drugs like cyclosporine and aminoglycosides. 4. Hypersensitivity: Skin rashes, eosinophilia, photosensitivity, etc. may occur.Drug Interactions 1. Furosemide/thiazides /H11003 digoxin: These diuretics cause hypokalaemia which increases the binding of digoxin to Na/H11001-K/H11001-ATPase leading to digoxin toxicity. 2. Furosemide /H11003 aminoglycosides: Both are ototoxic drugs and cause enhanced toxicity when used together. 3. Furosemide /H11003 nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs): NSAIDs in-hibit PG synthesis and block prostaglandin-mediated haemodynamic changes of loop diuretics. Chronic use of NSAIDs leads to Na/H11001 and H2O retention and di-minish the antihypertensive effect of loop diuretics/thiazides. 4. Furosemide/thiazides /H11003 lithium: Diuretics cause hyponatraemia resulting in compensatory increase in reabsorption of sodium and lithium in the PCT leading to lithium toxicity. 5. Furosemide/chlorthalidone /H11003 amiloride: Furosemide/chlorthalidone causes hypokalaemia, whereas amiloride conserves potassium. The combination of  these diuretics does not alter plasma potassium levels; also improves diuretic  response – synergistic effect.Thiazides (Benzothiadiazides) and Thiazide-Related DiureticsThiazides are medium-efﬁcacy diuretics.Mechanism of Action.  Thiazides inhibit Na/H11001–Cl/H11002 symport in early distal tubule (site 3) and increase Na/H11001 and Cl/H11002 excretion (Fig. 4.4). There is increased delivery of Na/H11001 to late distal tubule. Hence, there is increased exchange of Na/H11001–K/H11001 which results in K/H11001 loss. Some of the thiazides also have weak carbonic anhydrase inhibitory action and  increase HCO3/H11002 l o s s .  T h e r e f o r e ,  t h e r e  i s  a  n e t  l o s s  o f N a/H11001, K/H11001, Cl/H11002, HCO3/H11002 i n  u r i n e .  Unlike loop diuretics, thiazides decrease Ca2/H11001 excretion.Pharmacokinetics.  Thiazides are administered orally. They have long duration of action and are excreted in urine.Uses 1 . Hypertension: Thiazides are used in the treatment of essential hypertension (see p. 104). 2. Oedema: Thiazides are used in combination with loop diuretics in severe CHF. They are not very effective in hepatic oedema. Most thiazides, except metolazone, are not effective when glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR) is low. 3. Hypercalciuria: Thiazides are used in calcium nephrolithiasis as they reduce the urinary excretion of calcium. 4. Diabetes insipidus (DI) (see p. 163).

Goodman: Goodman & Gilman’s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 13th edition, McGraw Hill, 2018.)Adverse Effects 1. Thiazides cause electrolyte disturbances which include hypokalaemia, hypona-traemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypercalcaemia. (a) Hypokalaemia is more common with thiazides than loop diuretics because of their long duration of action. (b) Hypercalcaemia is due to decreased urinary excretion of Ca2/H11001. 2. The metabolic disturbances are similar to that of loop diuretics – hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia and hyperuricaemia. 3. They may cause impotence; hence, thiazides are not the preferred antihyperten-sives in young males. 4. Others: Skin rashes, photosensitivity, gastrointestinal disturbances like nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea can occur. Diuretics should be avoided in pregnancy as they reduce placental perfusion by decreasing blood volume which can cause fetal death.Thiazide-Related DiureticsChlorthalidone is a frequently used thiazide-related diuretic in hypertension as it has a long duration of action. Indapamide and metolazone are longer acting than thiazides. They are used in hypertension. Metolazone and xipamide are also used for treatment of oedema. Metolazone can be used in severe renal failure.Potassium-Sparing DiureticsAldosterone Antagonists Spironolactone.  Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist. It is a synthetic steroid and structurally related to aldosterone.Aldosterone enters the cell and binds to speciﬁc mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in the cytoplasm of late distal tubule and CD cells (site 4). The hormone receptor complex (MR–AL) enters the cell nucleus, where it induces synthesis of aldosterone-induced proteins (AIPs). The net effect of AIPs is to retain sodium and excrete potassium (Fig. 4.5).Spironolactone competitively blocks the MR and prevents the formation of AIPs. Therefore, spironolactone promotes Na/H11001 excretion and K/H11001 retention. Spironolactone 

1594—RENAL PHARMACOLOGY
is most effective when circulating aldosterone levels are high. It also increases Ca2/H11001 excretion.Pharmacokinetics.  Spironolactone is administered orally, gets partly absorbed and is highly bound to plasma proteins; extensively metabolized in liver and forms active metabolite, canrenone, which has a long plasma half-life.Uses 1. In oedematous conditions associated with secondary hyperaldosteronism (CCF, hepatic cirrhosis and nephrotic syndrome). 2. CCF: Spironolactone is often used in moderate-severe heart failure because it blocks the effects of aldosterone. It prevents hypokalaemia, ventricular remodel-ling and retards the progression of the disease. 3. Spironolactone is often used with thiazides/loop diuretics: Serum potassium level is maintained and antihypertensive efﬁcacy is enhanced. 4. Resistant hypertension due to primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn’s syndrome).Adverse Effects.  Hyperkalaemia is the major adverse effect of aldosterone antagonists. The risk is greater in patients with renal disease or in those receiving ACE inhibitors, ARBs, /H9252-blockers, NSAIDs, etc.The other adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, peptic ulcer, drowsi-ness, mental confusion, menstrual disturbances, gynaecomastia and decreased libido (antiandrogenic effect).Drug InteractionI ACE inhibitors /H11003 spironolactone: Dangerous hyperkalaemia can occur.Eplerenone, an aldosterone antagonist, is more selective for MR. Hence, it is less likely to cause gynaecomastia. Its therapeutic uses include hypertension and chronic heart failure.Amiloride and Triamterene (Directly Acting Drugs).  Both are directly acting potassium-sparing diuretics. They directly block Na/H11001 channels in the luminal membrane of the cells of late distal tubule and CD. The net effect of these drugs is to increase Na/H11001 excretion Spironolactone(antagonist)MRALAldosterone(agonist)

Amiloride inhibits H/H11001 secretion in CD – acidosis can occur. Both are low-efﬁcacy diuretics. Amiloride is more potent and longer acting than triamterene. Triamterene is extensively metabolized while amiloride is excreted unchanged in urine.Uses 1. Potassium-sparing diuretics are used with thiazides/loop diuretics for the treatment of hypertension. The combination therapy increases diuretic and anti-hypertensive effects of thiazides or loop diuretics. They also correct hypokalaemia due to thiazides/loop diuretics. 2. Amiloride is used for the treatment of lithium-induced nephrogenic DI. It blocks lithium transport through Na/H11001 channels in the cells of the CD. 3. Amiloride (aerosol) improves mucociliary clearance in patients with cystic ﬁbrosis.Adverse Effects.  These include hyperkalaemia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, dizziness, muscle cramps, etc.Various diuretics with their site and mechanism of action are shown in Table 4.1.Diuretic ResistanceIt is said to occur when the oedema does not respond to a diuretic. Decrease in diuretic response usually due to long-term therapy is common with thiazides; can also occur with loop diuretics. Prolonged use of diuretics causes some pathological changes in the renal tubules, which may lead to development of diuretic resistance.Diuretic resistance is mainly seen in elderly patients due to age-related declined renal function.Elderly patients•  ↓ GFR•  ↓ Renal functionDiuretic cannot reachthe site of actionDecreased diuretic responseDiureticsSite of actionMechanism  of actionEfﬁcacyAcetazolamidePCTCarbonic anhydrase  inhibitorLowLoop diureticsThick ascending limb  of loop of HenleInhibit Na/H11001–K/H11001–2Cl/H11002 cotransportHighThiazidesEarly distal tubuleInhibit Na/H11001–Cl/H11002 symportMediumPotassium- sparing  diureticsDT and CD• Aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone and eplerenone)• Directly acting (amiloride and triamterene)LowMannitolLoop of Henle and PCTOsmotic effectHighTable 4.1   Diuretics with their site and mechanism of action

It is administered by i.v., i.m., s.c. or intranasal routes and has a short duration of action (Table 4.2).Vasopressin AnaloguesDesmopressin: It is a selective V2 receptor agonist and is more potent than vasopres-sin as an antidiuretic. It has negligible vasoconstrictor action. It is administered by oral, nasal and parenteral routes.Other factors include chronic renal failure, liver diseases, heart failure and co-administration of diuretic with a NSAID. Resistance can be overcome to some  extent by: i) Increasing the dose and frequency of a diuretic ii) Taking diuretic before meal iii) Salt-restricted diet iv) Proper bed rest v) Use of combination of diuretics

162PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES
Lypressin: It acts on both V1 and V2 receptors. It is less potent but longer acting than vasopressin. It is administered parenterally.T erlipressin: It is a prodrug of vasopressin with selective V1 action. It is administered intravenously.Uses of Vasopressin Analogues 1. For emergency control of bleeding oesophageal varices: T erlipressin is preferred to vasopressin because it is safer. It acts on V1 receptor n constricts mesenteric blood vessels n decreases blood ﬂow to portal vessels n reduces pressure in the varices n stops bleeding. 2. Vasopressin may be used before abdominal radiography to expel intestinal gas by acting on V1 receptor in the intestine. 3. Central (neurogenic) DI – desmopressin (V2-mediated action) is the drug of choice (see Table 4.3). It is not effective in nephrogenic DI. (a) Haemophilia and von Willebrand’s disease – Desmopressin, administered intravenously, controls bleeding by promoting release of factor VIII and von Willebrand’s factor (by acting on V2 receptors). (b) Primary nocturnal enuresis – Administration of desmopressin at bedtime reduces nocturnal urine volume (V2-mediated action).DI is a condition characterized by excretion of large volume of dilute urine either due to decreased secretion of ADH from the neurohypophysis (neurogenic DI) or due to an inadequate renal tubular response to ADH (nephrogenic DI).Adverse Effects of Vasopressin Analogues 1. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, belching and abdominal cramps. 2. Backache is due to uterine contraction. 3. Vasopressin can precipitate an attack of angina by constricting coronary blood vessels. Hence, it is contraindicated in patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease. 4 .  Intranasal administration of desmopressin may cause local irritation and ulceration. 5. Fluid retention and hyponatraemia can occur (V2-mediated). It should not be given to patients with acute renal failure.Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH) SecretionIn SIADH, there is impaired water excretion along with hyponatraemia and low plasma osmolality due to inappropriate ADH secretion.

Its action  on V2 receptors in the cells of collect-ing duct results in a decrease  in urine volume.Other drugs, if patient does not  tolerate desmopressin.Chlorpropamide (oral antidiabetic agent): Increases antidiuretic effect  of ADH on kidney.Carbamazepine (antiepileptic drug): Decreases urine volume in high doses.Thiazides are also useful in central DI as they decrease urine volume; they act paradoxically in these  patients.• ADH levels are normal, but renal tubules (CD) fail to respond to ADH.• Drugs:Thiazides: Exact mechanism of action of thiazides in DI is not clear.  Thiazides probably act by depleting sodium and ECF volume which  results in a compensatory increase in proximal tubular reabsorption  of Na/H11001 and water leading to a decrease in urine volume. Moreover, action of thiazides in the early distal tubule results in the formation of less dilute urine.Amiloride is the preferred drug for lithium-induced nephrogenic DI as  it blocks lithium and sodium entry into the renal epithelial cells.Indomethacin reduces urine volume in nephrogenic DI by inhibiting renal prostaglandin synthesis.Table 4.3   Types of diabetes insipidus with their treatment

Hypnotic is a drug that produces sleep-resembling normal sleep.SLEEPThe phases of sleep include nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye move-ment (REM) sleep. NREM sleep is divided into the following stages: 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. Normally, about 50% of sleep time is spent in stage 2. Slow wave sleep includes stages 3 and 4. REM sleep constitutes about 30% of the sleep time and lasts for 5–30 minutes in each cycle of sleep.Types of sleep disorders and their treatment are given in Table 5.1.CLASSIFICATION OF SEDATIVES AND HYPNOTICS 1 .

1675—DRUGS ACTING ON CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEMPharmacological Actions and Therapeutic Uses 1. Sedation and hypnosis: BZDs decrease time required to fall asleep (sleep latency). The total sleep time is increased. They shorten all stages of NREM sleep except stage 2, which is prolonged. The duration of REM sleep is usually decreased. BZDs reduce night awakenings and produce refreshing sleep.At present, BZDs are preferred to barbiturates for treatment of short-term insomnia because:I They have a wide therapeutic index.I They cause near-normal sleep; less rebound phenomena on withdrawal.I They produce minimal hangover effects (headache and residual drowsiness on waking).I They cause minimal respiratory depression.I They are less likely to cause tolerance and dependence when used for short period.I They have no enzyme-inducing property; hence, drug interactions are less.I They have a speciﬁc BZD-receptor antagonist, ﬂumazenil, for the treatment of overdosage.Long-term use of BZDs for insomnia is not recommended because of develop-ment of tolerance, dependence and hangover effects; but these drugs are ideal for occasional use by air travellers, shift workers, etc. 2 .  Anticonvulsant: Diazepam, lorazepam, clonazepam, clobazam, etc. have anti-convulsant effect. Intravenous (i.v.) diazepam/lorazepam is used to control life-threatening seizures in status epilepticus, tetanus, drug-induced convul-sions, febrile convulsions, etc. Clonazepam is used in the treatment of absence seizures. 3. Diagnostic (endoscopies) and minor operative procedures: i.v. BZDs are used because of their sedative–amnesic–analgesic and muscle relaxant properties. 4. Preanaesthetic medication and general anaesthesia (GA): These drugs are used as preanaesthetic medication because of their sedative–amnesic and anxiolytic effects. Hence, the patient cannot recall the perioperative events later. i.v. diaze-pam, lorazepam, midazolam, etc. are combined with other CNS depressants to produce GA. 5. Antianxiety (anxiolytic) effect: Some of the BZDs (diazepam, oxazepam, alpra-zolam, lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide, etc.) have selective antianxiety action at low doses. The anxiolytic effect is due to their action on limbic system. T olerance to antianxiety action of BZDs develops only on prolonged use. 6. Muscle relaxant (centrally acting): They reduce skeletal muscle tone by inhibiting polysynaptic reﬂexes in the spinal cord. The relaxant effect of BZDs is useful in spinal injuries, tetanus, cerebral palsy and to reduce spasm due to joint injury or sprain. 7. To treat alcohol-withdrawal symptoms: Long-acting BZDs, such as chlordiaz-epoxide and diazepam are used. 8. Conscious sedation: See p. 181.

The rate of absorption following oral administration is variable; absorption is erratic from intramuscular (i.m.) site of administration; hence rarely used. They have a large volume of distribution. They have a short duration of action on  occasional use because of rapid redistribution, hence, are free of residual (hangover) effects, even though elimination half-life is long. BZDs are metabolized in liver. Some undergo enterohepatic recycling. Some of them produce active metabolites which have long half-life; hence, cumulative effects may be seen. Oxazepam is not signiﬁcantly me-tabolized in liver. The metabolites are excreted in urine. BZDs cross placental barrier.Adverse EffectsBZDs have a wide margin of safety. They are generally well tolerated. The common side effects are drowsiness, confusion, blurred vision, amnesia, disorientation, tolerance and drug dependence. Withdrawal after chronic use causes symptoms like tremor, insomnia, restlessness, nervousness and loss of appetite. Use of BZDs during labour may cause respiratory depression and hypotonia in newborn (Floppy baby syndrome). In some patients, these drugs may produce paradoxical effects, i.e. convulsions and anxiety.Important features of BZDs are given in T able 5.2.Inverse Agonist (/H9252-Carboline).  Its interaction with BZD receptors will produce anxiety and convulsions.Benzodiazepine Antagonist (Flumazenil).  Flumazenil competitively reverses the effects of both BZD agonists (CNS depression) and BZD inverse agonists (CNS stimulation, Fig. 5.4). Flumazenil is not used orally because of its high ﬁrst-pass metabolism. It is given by i.v. route and has a rapid onset of action. Flumazenil is used in the treatment of BZD overdosage and to reverse the sedative effect of BZDs during GA. It can also be used to reverse the hypnotic effect of zolpidem, zaleplon and eszopiclone.

effects include confusion, dizziness and nausea. It may precipitate withdrawal symptoms (anxiety and convulsions) in dependent subjects.Barbiturates  PH1.19All barbiturates are derivatives of barbituric acid. They are nonselective CNS  depressants and act at many sites, ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) being the main site.Mechanism of ActionBarbiturates have GABA facilitatory action – they potentiate inhibitory effects of GABA.BarbituratesBind to GABAA receptor(different from BZD-binding site)The duration of Cl− channel kept open is increasedIncrease in GABA-mediated chloride currentMembrane hyperpolarizationCNS depressionAt high concentrations, barbiturates have GABA-mimetic effect (i.e. barbiturates can directly increase Cl/H11002 conductance into the neuron).Pharmacological Actions and Uses 1. Sedation and hypnosis: Barbiturates were used in the treatment of insomnia. They decrease sleep latency, duration of REM sleep, stage 3 and 4 of NREM sleep. They cause marked alteration of sleep architecture. At present, barbiturates are not recommended because:I They have a low therapeutic index.I They cause rebound increase in REM sleep on stoppage of therapy.Flumazenil (antagonist)BZDRBZD agonistsBZD inverse agonistsFig. 5.4 Competitive antagonism. BZDR, Benzodiazepine receptor.

1715—DRUGS ACTING ON CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEMI They cause marked respiratory depression.I They produce marked hangover effects (headache and drowsiness next day morning).I They cause high degree of tolerance and drug dependence.I They are potent enzyme inducers and cause many drug interactions.I They have no speciﬁc antidote. 2. General anaesthesia (GA): Ultrashort-acting barbiturates (thiopentone and methohexitone) may be used for induction of GA. 3. Anticonvulsant: Phenobarbitone has anticonvulsant effect and is used in the treatment of status epilepticus and generalized tonic–clonic seizures (GTCS, grand mal epilepsy). 4. Neonatal jaundice of nonhaemolytic type: Phenobarbitone may be used to re-duce serum bilirubin levels. It induces glucuronyl transferase enzyme and hastens the metabolism of bilirubin.Adverse Effects 1. The common side effects are drowsiness, confusion, headache, ataxia, hypotension and respiratory depression. 2. Hypersensitivity reactions like skin rashes, itching and swelling of face may occur. 3. T olerance develops to their sedative and hypnotic actions on repeated use. 4. Physical and psychological dependence develops on repeated use. 5. Prolonged use of phenobarbitone may cause megaloblastic anaemia by interfering with absorption of folic acid from gut. 6. They may precipitate attacks of acute intermittent porphyria by inducing ALA synthase that catalyses the production of porphyrins; hence, barbiturates are con-traindicated in porphyria. 7. Acute barbiturate poisoning: The signs and symptoms are drowsiness, restlessness, hallucinations, hypotension, respiratory depression, convulsions, coma and  death.Treatment of acute barbiturate poisoningI Maintain airway, breathing and circulation.I Maintain electrolyte balance.I Gastric lavage – after stomach wash, administer activated charcoal that may enhance the elimination of phenobarbitone. Endotracheal intubation  is performed before gastric lavage to protect the airway in unconscious  patients.I Alkaline diuresis – there is no speciﬁc antidote for barbiturates; main treat-ment is alkaline diuresis. i.v. NaHCO3 alkalinizes urine. Barbiturates are weakly acidic drugs. In alkaline urine, barbiturates exist in ionized form, so they are not reabsorbed while passing through renal tubules and are rapidly excreted in urine.I Haemodialysis is employed in severe cases.Drug InteractionsBarbiturates are potent inducers of hepatic microsomal enzymes and reduce the effec-tiveness of co-administered drugs (e.g. oral contraceptives [OCs], oral anticoagulants and oral hypoglycaemics).

172PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESNonbenzodiazepine Hypnotics  PH1.19They include zolpidem, zopiclone, zaleplon, eszopiclone and etizolam. They have less potential for abuse than BZDs.They have less antianxiety, anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant effects than BZDs. Effect on REM sleep is less as compared to BZDs.ZOLPIDEMZolpidem mainly produces hypnotic effect – decreases sleep latency and increases duration of sleep time in insomnia. It produces near-normal sleep like BZDs with minimal alteration in REM sleep; causes minimal hangover effects and rebound insomnia; less likely to produce tolerance and drug dependence; lacks anticonvul-sant, antianxiety and muscle relaxant effects. It is given orally, well absorbed,  metabolized in liver and excreted in urine. It has a short duration of action and is used for short-term treatment of insomnia. The actions of zolpidem are antagonized by ﬂumazenil. The common side effects are headache, confusion, nausea and vomiting.Mechanism of ActionZolpidem, zopiclone, zaleplon, eszopiclone(nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics)Bind selectively toBZD binding site on GABAA receptorFacilitate GABA-mediatedneuronal inhibitionCNS depressionZOPICLONEIt is orally effective and is used for short-term treatment of insomnia. It produces near-normal sleep like BZDs. The side effects are headache, drowsiness, GI disturbances and metallic taste.ZALEPLONIt is useful in sleep onset insomnia. It is the shortest acting non-BZD hypnotic.ESZOPICLONEIt is used orally for short- and long-term treatment of insomnia.ETIZOLAMIt is a BZD analogue with hypnotic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant and antianxiety ef-fects. It is useful for short-term treatment of insomnia.

1735—DRUGS ACTING ON CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEMMELATONINIt is the hormone secreted by the pineal gland; involved in the maintenance of sleep–wake cycle and circadian rhythm.RAMELTEONIt is a melatonin-receptor (MT1 and MT2) agonist, can be used orally for the treatment of sleep onset insomnia. It reduces sleep latency and prolongs total duration of sleep. There is no rebound insomnia on withdrawal; does not cause tolerance on chronic use. The important adverse effects are fatigue and dizziness.TASIMELTEONIt is another melatonin-receptor agonist used for the treatment of circadian rhythm disorder in blind patients.SUVOREXANTIt prevents orexin from maintaining wakefulness by blocking orexin receptors. It is use-ful in chronic insomnia.General Anaesthetics  PH1.18GA refers to drug-induced reversible loss of consciousness and all sensations. The fea-tures of GA are as follows: 1. Reversible loss of consciousness. 2. Reversible loss of sensation. 3. Analgesia and amnesia. 4. Muscle relaxation and abolition of reﬂexes.There is no single anaesthetic agent that can produce all the above effects. Hence, anaesthetic protocol includes: 1. Premedication. 2. Induction of anaesthesia (e.g. propofol). 3. Maintenance of anaesthesia (e.g. N2O /H11001 isoﬂurane). 4. Skeletal muscle relaxation. 5. Analgesia – as premedication, during and after the operation. 6. Use of other drugs:I T o reverse neuromuscular blockade.I T o reverse the residual effects of opioids (naloxone) and BZDs (ﬂumazenil).Minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) is the minimum concentration of an anaes-thetic in alveoli required to produce immobility in response to a painful stimulus in 50% patients. It indicates the potency of inhalational general anaesthetics (N2O /H11022 100%, halothane 0.75%).MECHANISM OF ACTION OF GENERAL ANAESTHETICSThe main site of action of anaesthetics is reticular formation, which normally maintains a state of consciousness. Most anaesthetics decrease transmission in reticular formation by enhancing the activity of inhibitory transmitters like GABA (e.g. BZDs, barbiturates 

174PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES
and propofol) and blocking the activity of excitatory transmitters (e.g. blockade  of N-methyl-D-aspartate [NMDA] glutamate receptors by ketamine and nitrous oxide).Stages of GA (Table 5.3): Stages I–IV are seen mainly with ether because of its slow action. Stage II is the most dangerous period. Surgical procedures are performed in  stage III. The aim of induction is to reach stage III as early as possible followed by main-tenance anaesthesia and muscle relaxation.CLASSIFICATIONInhalationalV olatile liquids• Ether• Halothane• Isoﬂ  urane• Desﬂ  urane• Sevoﬂ  uraneGas• Nitrous    oxideParenteralInducing drugs••• P r o p o f o l E t o m i d a t e Thiopentone Methohexitone•Slow-acting drugs• Benzodiazepines: Diazepam, lorazepam, midazolam• Ketamine• Opioids: Fentanyl, alfentanil, sufentanil, remifentanilGeneral anaesthetics

Irritation of respiratory passages 10. Postoperative nausea and vomiting 11. Other pointsI Use of ether is obsolete.I Halothane sensitizes the myocardium to the arrhythmogenic effect of catechol-amines.I Speed of induction and recovery depends on solubility of anaesthetic agent in blood and fat.I Anaesthetics with low blood solubility produce rapid induction and recovery (e.g. N2O and desﬂurane).I Anaesthetics with high solubility in blood produce slow induction and recovery (e.g. ether).I Desﬂurane, isoﬂurane and ether irritate respiratory passages and can induce cough.I The basis for combining halothane/isoﬂurane and nitrous oxide: (a) The concentration (MAC) of halothane/isoﬂurane required to produce anaes-thesia is reduced when given with N2O because of second gas effect. As the concentration of halothane/isoﬂurane required is reduced, the side effects of halothane/isoﬂurane (hypotension and respiratory depression) are reduced.Second gas effect: N2O rapidly diffuses, whereas halothane/isoﬂurane diffuses poorly into the blood (alveoli ↔blood ↔brain). When these (halothane/isoﬂurane and N2O) anaesthetics are administered simultaneously, halo-thane/isoﬂurane also enters the blood rapidly along with rapidly diffusible gas (N2O). This is known as ‘second gas effect’ . (b) Because of reduction in the dosage, recovery will be faster. (c) Halothane/isoﬂurane is a potent anaesthetic and poor analgesic, whereas N2O is a good analgesic and poor anaesthetic; hence, the combined effect of these two drugs results in potent anaesthesia and good analgesia.Diffusion Hypoxia.  Nitrous oxide has low blood solubility – when the administration of N2O is discontinued, it rapidly diffuses from the blood into alveoli and causes marked reduction of PaO2 in the alveoli resulting in hypoxia which is known as diffusion hypoxia. It can be avoided by giving 100% O2 for a few minutes immediately after N2O is discontinued.Comparative features of halogenated anaesthetics are given in Table 5.5.PARENTERAL GENERAL ANAESTHETICSInducing DrugsPropofol.  It is available as 1% emulsion for i.v. administration. Propofol is a commonly used, popular, rapidly acting anaesthetic.Propofol acts on GABA receptors to increase chloride conductance and hyperpolar-ization of neurons, thus produces CNS depression. It has a rapid onset and short dura-tion of action; for long procedures – it can be given in repeated doses or as continuous

It is highly bound to plasma protein; crosses placental barrier and  can be used in pregnant woman. It is metabolized in liver and excreted rapidly in  urine. 1. Induction of anaesthesia and recovery are rapid. Residual symptoms are less. 2. Most suitable for outpatient surgical procedures. 3. No irritation of air passages; suitable for use in asthmatics. 4. Has antiemetic effect; hence, postoperative nausea and vomiting are rare. 5. Can be used for both induction and maintenance of anaesthesia. 6 .  Frequently used to sedate patients in ICU (intensive care unit) who are intubated. 7. It is used in status epilepticus when not controlled by other drugs. 8. Causes respiratory depression and fall in BP . 9. Pain on injection occurs – can be reduced with lignocaine. 10. In high doses, can cause acidosis and rise in blood lipid levels.Note: Propofol – Popular, Rapid acting, preferred for OP surgical procedures, causes FOL (fall) in BP .Thiopentone Sodium (Fig. 5.5). It is an ultra short-acting barbiturate. It is a commonly used i.v. anaesthetic for induction of anaesthesia. It is highly lipid soluble, hence has a rapid onset and short duration (5–8 minutes) of action. It is highly alkaline (pH 10.5–11), hence highly irritant. It should be prepared as a fresh solution before injection. It is injected as 2.5% solution.After a single i.v. dose, it rapidly enters highly perfused organs like brain, liver and heart, and produces anaesthesia. As blood level of the drug falls rapidly, it diffuses out of the central nervous system into the blood and then to less perfused organs like skel-etal muscle and adipose tissue. This redistribution results in termination of drug action. Repeated doses will result in accumulation and delayed recovery.Uses 1. Thiopentone sodium is used for induction of anaesthesia. 2. It is occasionally used as anticonvulsant in cases not controlled by other drugs. 3. In subanaesthetic doses, thiopentone can be used for narcoanalysis in psychiatry.Advantages of Thiopentone 1. Rapid induction of anaesthesia and rapid recovery. 2. Does not sensitize the myocardium to circulating catecholamines.

1795—DRUGS ACTING ON CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEMDisadvantages/Adverse Effects of Thiopentone 1. Depresses the respiratory centre. 2. Depresses the vasomotor centre and myocardium. 3. Poor analgesic. 4. Poor muscle relaxant. 5. Causes laryngospasm. 6. Accidental intra-arterial injection causes vasospasm and gangrene of the arm. 7 .  It can precipitate acute intermittent porphyria by inducing the synthesis of ALA synthase, hence contraindicated in susceptible individuals (absolute contraindication).Etomidate.  It is an i.v. anaesthetic used for induction – has a rapid onset and short du-ration of action. It causes minimal cardiovascular and respiratory depression.Disadvantages/Adverse Effects 1. Has poor analgesic effect. 2. High incidence of pain on injection, postoperative nausea and vomiting. 3. Restlessness and rigidity are common.Slow-Acting DrugsKetamine.  It produces ‘dissociative anaesthesia’ , which is characterized by sedation, amne-sia, marked analgesia, unresponsiveness to commands and dissociation from the sur-roundings. It acts by blocking NMDA type of glutamate receptors. It is commonly given by i.v. route; other routes are i.m., oral and rectal. Ketamine has good analgesic effect. It causes bronchodilatation, suitable for use in asthmatics. Ketamine causes sympathetic stimulation – heart rate, BP, cardiac output and skeletal muscle tone are usually increased. It is used in patients with hypovolaemia. It is well tolerated by children.Site of action: cortex and subcortical areas.Ketamine is highly lipid soluble, rapidly enters highly perfused organs like brain, liver and heart; later, it redistributes to less perfused organs. It is metabolized in liver; ex-creted in urine and bile.Uses 1. For operations on the head, neck and face. 2. For dressing burn wounds. 3. Well suited for children/asthmatics undergoing short procedures.Adverse Effects and Contraindications 1. Increases BP and heart rate, hence is contraindicated in patients with hyperten-sion and ischaemic heart disease. 2. Increases intracranial pressure. 3. Causes emergence delirium and hallucinations.Benzodiazepines.  BZDs are slow-acting parenteral anaesthetics. They include diazepam, lorazepam and midazolam. Use of large doses delays recovery and prolongs amnesia. They have poor analgesic effect. They do not cause postoperative nausea and vomiting. The effects of BZDs can be reversed by ﬂumazenil.

To reduce anxiety and apprehension: BZDs like diazepam, lorazepam or midazolam are preferred because of their sedative, amnesic, calming, anxiolytic effects and wide margin of safety. They reduce anxiety by acting on limbic  system. 2. To prevent vagal bradycardia and to reduce salivary secretion caused by anaes-thetics: Antimuscarinic agents such as atropine or glycopyrrolate are used to prevent vagal bradycardia and hypotension. They also prevent laryngospasm by reducing respiratory secretion. Glycopyrrolate is preferred because it is potent, does not produce CNS effects and causes less tachycardia. 3. To relieve pre- and postoperative pain: Opioid analgesics such as morphine, pethidine or fentanyl may be used to relieve pain. The limitations with opioids are respiratory depression, hypotension, nausea, vomiting, constipation, biliary spasm and bronchospasm in asthmatics. NSAIDs like diclofenac can also be used. 4. For antiemetic effect: Metoclopramide, domperidone or ondansetron may be used to control vomiting. Acute dystonias and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) are the main side effects of metoclopramide; domperidone rarely produces EPS. 5-HT3 antagonist like ondansetron is the preferred antiemetic as it rarely causes adverse effects and is well tolerated. 5. To prevent acid secretion and stress ulcer: H2-blocker such as ranitidine or proton-pump inhibitor like omeprazole may be used to reduce gastric acid secre-tion and aspiration pneumonia especially before prolonged surgery. 6. To hasten gastric emptying before emergency surgery: Metoclopramide or dom-peridone may be used. They are prokinetic drugs – increase the tone of lower oesophageal sphincter and accelerate gastric emptying, thus prevent aspiration pneumonia.

1815—DRUGS ACTING ON CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEMCONSCIOUS SEDATIONIt is a level of CNS depression where a patient does not lose consciousness but is able to communicate and cooperate during the procedure/treatment. It is used in: 1. Uncooperative patients. 2. Anxious patients. 3. Emotionally compromised patients.It should be avoided in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pregnancy, prolonged surgery, psychoses, etc. The drugs used are BZDs such as diazepam (oral, i.v.), midazolam (i.v.) and temazepam (oral); nitrous oxide /H11001 oxygen (inhalation); propofol (i.v. infusion) and fentanyl (i.v.).Local Anaesthetics  PH1.17Local anaesthetics (LAs) are drugs which, when applied topically or injected locally, block nerve conduction and cause reversible loss of all sensation in the part supplied  by the nerve. The order of blockade of nerve function proceeds in the following  manner – pain, temperature, touch, pressure and ﬁnally skeletal muscle power.CHEMISTRY (Fig. 5.6)LAs are weak bases. They consist of three parts: (i) hydrophilic amino group; (ii) lipophilic aromatic group; and (iii) intermediate ester or amide linkage.CLASSIFICATION OF LOCAL ANAESTHETICS 1. According to clinical use (a) Surface anaesthetics: Cocaine, lignocaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, oxethazaine, proparacaine, butylaminobenzoate. (b) Injectable anaesthetics (i) Short acting with low potency: Procaine, chloroprocaine. (ii) Intermediate acting with intermediate potency: Lignocaine, mepivacaine, prilocaine, articaine. (iii) Long acting with high potency: T etracaine, bupivacaine, dibucaine, ropivacaine. 2. According to structure (a) Esters*: Cocaine, procaine, chloroprocaine, benzocaine, tetracaine. (b) Amides*: Lignocaine, mepivacaine, bupivacaine, prilocaine, articaine, ropivacaine.

182PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESMECHANISM OF ACTIONLAs act on voltage-sensitive Na/H11001 channels. Sodium channels exist in resting, open and inactivated states (resting n open n inactivated state). The channels have to recover from the inactivated state to resting state before they can be opened in response to an impulse.The LAs in ‘unionized’ form easily penetrate nerve sheath and axon membrane. Within the axoplasm, the molecules become ‘ionized’ and block the voltage-gated Na/H11001 channels.Local anaesthetics are weak basesAt tissue pH (7.4)Partly ionizedPartly unionizedPenetrate the nerve membraneEnter the axon (axonal pH is low)Reionization of local anaestheticsLAs block the voltage-gated Na+ channel from inside; binds more tightly toPrevent entry of Na+ ions into the neuron – decreasing the rate of depolarizationPrevent generation of action potentialNo generation and conduction of impulses to CNSLocal anaesthesiaLA  gains access to its  receptor in the open state of the channel inactivated  state, prolongs the inactivated state
I Blockade is frequency dependent.I Action of LA is pH dependent and the penetrability of LA is increased at alkaline pH (i.e. when the unionized form is more). Penetrability is very poor at acidic pH of tissues. In infected tissues, there is a low pH, which causes ionization of the drug. This reduces penetration of LA through the cell membrane, thus decreases the ef-fectiveness of LAs. Therefore, LAs are less effective in inﬂamed and infected areas.I Diameter of nerve ﬁbres: LAs block small ﬁbres ﬁrst followed by larger ﬁbres.I Myelinated ﬁbres are blocked earlier than nonmyelinated nerves of the same diameter.I Sensory ﬁbres are blocked earlier than motor ﬁbres because of their high ﬁring rate and longer duration of action potential.

1835—DRUGS ACTING ON CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEMI Fibres in the centre are blocked later than the ones located in the circumference of the nerve bundle.FACTORS AFFECTING LOCAL ANAESTHETIC ACTION 1. pKa: Higher the pKa, more is the ionized fraction of the drug at physiological pH. Hence, onset of action is slow and vice versa, e.g. the pKa of procaine is 9.1. So, it has slow onset of action; whereas pKa of lignocaine is 7.7 – it has rapid onset of action. Although pKa of chloroprocaine is 9.1, it has a rapid onset of action. 2. Degree of plasma protein binding: Higher the plasma protein binding, longer the duration of action of the drug, e.g. procaine is poorly bound to plasma proteins, hence has a short duration of action, whereas bupivacaine is highly plasma protein bound and has longer duration of action. 3. Rate of diffusion from the site of administration: It depends on the initial con-centration gradient of the drug. Higher the concentration, rapid is the onset of action. 4. Lipid solubility: Higher the lipid solubility, more is the potency of the drug, e.g. lignocaine is more potent than procaine as it is more lipid soluble. 5. Presence of vasoconstrictor: Prolongs the duration of action of LAs. The com-monly used vasoconstrictor with LAs is adrenaline.COMBINATION OF VASOCONSTRICTOR WITH LOCAL ANAESTHETICAddition of a vasoconstrictor (e.g. adrenaline) to the LA has the following advantages: 1. Slow absorption from the local site which results in prolonged duration of action of LAs. 2. Decreased bleeding in the surgical ﬁeld. 3. Slow absorption of LA reduces its systemic toxicity.Disadvantages and contraindications of combining vasoconstrictor with LA: 1. Intense vasospasm and ischaemia in tissues with end arteries may cause gangrene of the part (e.g. ﬁngers, toes, penis, ear lobule and tip of the nose). Hence, use of vasoconstrictors is contraindicated in these sites. 2. Absorption of adrenaline can cause systemic toxicity – tachycardia, palpitation, rise of BP and precipitation of angina or cardiac arrhythmias. Hence, combined preparation (LA with adrenaline) should be avoided in patients with hyperten-sion, congestive cardiac failure (CCF), arrhythmias, ischaemic heart disease and uncontrolled hyperthyroidism. 3. May delay wound healing by reducing the blood ﬂow to the affected area.PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIONS 1. Nervous system (a) Peripheral nerves: Autonomic ﬁbres are blocked earlier than somatic ﬁbres. Sensation of pain disappears ﬁrst followed by temperature, touch, pressure and motor functions. (b) CNS: Most of the LAs cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) – initially they cause CNS stimulation and then depression in higher doses. They cause ex-citement, tremor, twitching, restlessness and convulsions. Large doses can cause respiratory depression, coma and death.

184PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES 2. Cardiovascular system (a) Heart: LAs, by blocking Na/H11001 channels, decrease abnormal pacemaker activity, contractility, conductivity, excitability, heart rate, cardiac output and increase effective refractory period. (i) At higher concentrations, i.v. administration of LAs may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias. (ii) Bupivacaine is more cardiotoxic than other LAs – may cause cardiovas-cular collapse and death. (iii) Lignocaine decreases automaticity and is useful in ventricular arrhythmias. (b) Blood vessels: LAs produce hypotension due to vasodilatation and myocardial depression.PHARMACOKINETICSMost of the ester-linked LAs are rapidly metabolized by plasma cholinesterase, whereas amide-linked drugs are metabolized mainly in liver. LAs (procaine, lignocaine, etc.) are not effective orally because of high ﬁrst-pass metabolism. In liver diseases, the metabo-lism of lignocaine may be impaired; hence, dose must be reduced accordingly.Comparative features of esters and amides are shown in Table 5.6.ADVERSE EFFECTS 1. CNS: LAs initially cause CNS stimulation followed by depression. They are rest-lessness, tremor, headache, drowsiness, confusion, convulsions followed by respi-ratory depression, coma and death. 2. CVS: Bradycardia, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias and rarely cardiovascular collapse and death. Bupivacaine is highly cardiotoxic. 3. Allergic reactions: These are skin rashes, itching, erythema, urticaria, wheezing, bronchospasm and rarely anaphylactic reaction. The incidence of allergic reac-tions is more with ester-linked LAs than with amide-linked LAs. 4. Mucosal irritation (cocaine) and methaemoglobinaemia (prilocaine) may be seen. 5. Methylparaben, preservative in LA preparation, may cause allergic reaction.Important properties of LAs are given in Table 5.7. 6.

186PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESProcaine (see T able 5.6).  It is a prototype drug for esters. It is rarely used now because of availability of better agents.Cocaine.  It is an alkaloid; excellent surface anaesthetic but rarely used because of its addiction liability.Chloroprocaine has a pKa of 9.1, but has rapid onset of action.T etracaine.  An ester type of LA, it has long duration but slow onset of action. It is useful for spinal anaesthesia because of its long duration of action. It is mainly used as a surface anaesthetic for eye, nose and upper respiratory tract.Lignocaine.  It is a prototype agent for amides. It is a very popular anaesthetic used widely for topical application, inﬁltration, spinal and conduction block anaesthesia. It is also available as a patch – can be used to control severe pain of postherpetic neuralgias.Bupivacaine.  It is a widely used LA. It is potent and has a long duration of action. It produces more sensory than motor blockade, hence very popular for obstetric analgesia. It is highly cardiotoxic and may precipitate ventricular arrhythmias.Levobupivacaine: It is similar to bupivacaine; but less cardiotoxic and less likely to cause seizures.Ropivacaine.  It is less potent and less cardiotoxic than bupivacaine. Its duration of ac-tion is similar to bupivacaine. It is used for both epidural and regional anaesthesia. It is more selective for sensory ﬁbres than motor ﬁbres, hence used in obstetric analgesia.Prilocaine.  It is an amide type of LA. It has intermediate onset and duration of action. It has poor vasodilatory effect, hence can be used without a vasoconstrictor. Prilocaine is not suitable for labour pain because of the risk of neonatal methaemoglobinaemia. It is mainly used for inﬁltration and i.v. regional anaesthesia.Eutectic Mixture (EMLA – Eutectic Mixture of Local Anaesthetics – Lignocaine [2.5%] and Prilocaine [2.5%]).  The melting point of the mixture is less than that of either com-pound alone. It can anaesthetize intact skin. EMLA has to be applied 1 hour before the procedure and is used for dermal anaesthesia during venesection and skin graft proce-dures. It should not be used on mucous membranes or abraded skin. It is contraindi-cated in patients with methaemoglobinaemia and infants.Dibucaine.  It is a very potent, highly toxic and the longest acting LA. It is rarely used for spinal anaesthesia, and is also available for topical application on mucous membrane and skin.Benoxinate.  It is a surface anaesthetic; useful for corneal anaesthesia.Benzocaine and Butylaminobenzoate.  Surface anaesthetics; cause minimal systemic toxicity; available as ointment and lozenges; used for haemorrhoids, anal ﬁssure and sore throat.Oxethazaine.  It is a topical anaesthetic and is used to anaesthetize gastric mucosa. It produces symptomatic relief in gastritis. It is available in combination with antacids.

1875—DRUGS ACTING ON CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEMTECHNIQUES OF LOCAL ANAESTHESIA (Table 5.8)Surface Anaesthesia (Topical Anaesthesia)LA is applied on the abraded skin and mucous membrane of the nose, mouth, eyes, throat, upper respiratory tract, oesophagus, urethra, ulcers, burns, ﬁssures, etc. Motor function is intact. T etracaine 2%, lignocaine 2%–10%, benzocaine 1%–2%, etc. are used for topical application. Surface anaesthetics are available as solution, ointment, gel, jelly, cream, spray, lozenges, etc.Addition of adrenaline does not prolong the duration of surface anaesthesia because of poor penetration. T opical anaesthetics are useful in many diagnostic procedures like tonometry in eye and during endoscopies.EMLA is used to anaesthetize the intact skin and structures in the superﬁcial subcu-taneous tissues.Inﬁltration AnaesthesiaLA is injected directly into tissues to be operated; it blocks sensory nerve endings. The most frequently used LAs for inﬁltration are lignocaine (0.5%–1%), procaine (0.5%–1%) and bupivacaine (0.125%–0.25%). Addition of adrenaline to LA (1:50,000–250,000) prolongs the duration of anaesthesia.Inﬁltration anaesthesia is suitable only for small areas. The main disadvantage of inﬁltration anaesthesia is the requirement of large amounts of the drug to anaesthetize relatively small area. It can be used for drainage of an abscess, excision of small swelling, LA techniqueDrugsTherapeutic  application (uses)Surface  anaesthesia (topical)• Lignocaine (2%–10%)• Tetracaine (2%)• BenzocaineAnaesthetize mucous membrane of the eyes, nose, mouth, cor-nea, urinary and upper respira-tory tracts, ﬁssures, ulcers, etc.Inﬁltration  anaesthesiaMost of the anaesthetics• Lignocaine (0.5%–1%)• Procaine (0.5%–1%)• Bupivacaine (0.125%–0.25%)• Ropivacaine• Abscess drainage• Excision of small swellings (e.g. lipoma)• Suturing of cut wounds, episiotomy, etc.Nerve block anaesthesiaMost of the anaestheticsUsed for surgery and neuralgiasSpinal anaes-thesia• Lignocaine (1.5%–5%)• Tetracaine (0.25%–0.5%)• Bupivacaine (0.5%–0.75%)Surgery on lower limbs, lower  abdomen, perineum, etc.,  caesarean sectionEpidural anaes-thesia• Lignocaine (2%)• Bupivacaine (0.5%–0.75%)• RopivacaineObstetric analgesiai.v. regional  anaesthesia (Bier’s block)• Lignocaine (0.5%)• Prilocaine (0.5%)For upper and lower limb  surgeriesTo anaesthetize gastric  mucosa• OxethazainePeptic ulcerTable 5.8   Methods of administration and uses of local anaesthetics

188PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESsuturing of cut wounds, episiotomy, etc. Inﬁltration anaesthesia is contraindicated, if there is local infection and clotting disorders.Conduction Block(i) Field Block Anaesthesia.  It is achieved by injecting an LA subcutaneously, which anaesthetizes the area distal to the injection. This principle is used in case of minor procedures of scalp, anterior abdominal wall, upper and lower extremities in which a smaller dose produces larger area of anaesthesia.(ii) Nerve Block Anaesthesia.  LA is injected very close to or around the peripheral nerve or nerve plexuses. It produces larger areas of anaesthesia than ﬁeld block. 1. Brachial plexus block for procedures on upper limb. 2. Cervical plexus block for surgery of the neck. 3. Intercostal nerve block for anterior abdominal wall surgery. 4. Sciatic and femoral nerve block for surgery distal to the knee.In this procedure, the requirement of LA is less than that of ﬁeld block and inﬁltra-tion anaesthesia.Spinal AnaesthesiaIt is one of the most popular forms of anaesthesia. LA is injected into the subarachnoid space to anaesthetize spinal roots.Site of Injection. The anaesthetic is injected into the space between L2 and L3 or L3 and L4 below the lower end of the spinal cord. The level of anaesthesia is inﬂuenced by (i) site of injection, (ii) amount of ﬂuid injected, (iii) force of injection, (iv) speciﬁc gravity of the drug solution (hyperbaric [in 10% glucose], hypobaric [in distilled water] or isobaric) and (v) position of the patient – lying prone/lateral or tilted with head-down position.LAs Used for Spinal Anaesthesia.  They are lignocaine, tetracaine, bupivacaine, etc. Ad-dition of adrenaline to spinal anaesthetic increases the duration or intensity of block.Uses.  Spinal anaesthesia can be used for surgical procedures below the level of umbili-cus, i.e. lower limb surgery, caesarean section, obstetric procedures, prostatectomy, sur-gery on perineum, appendicectomy, etc.Advantages of Spinal Anaesthesia.  No loss of consciousness, good muscle relaxation and good analgesia. Patients with cardiac, pulmonary and renal disease tolerate spinal anaes-thesia better than GA.Complications 1. Headache is due to leakage of CSF and can be reduced by using very ﬁne needle. 2. Hypotension is due to blockade of sympathetic vasoconstrictor ﬁbres to blood vessels. Venous return to the heart is reduced due to paralysis of skeletal muscles in the legs. Hypotension is treated by raising foot end and administration of sym-pathomimetics such as ephedrine, mephentermine and phenylephrine. 3. Respiratory paralysis: It is due to paralysis of intercostal muscles. Respiratory fail-ure may occur due to respiratory centre ischaemia as a result of hypotension. 4. Septic meningitis and nerve injury are extremely rare at present, because of good anaesthetic practice. 5. Postoperative urinary retention may occur.Contraindications.  Spinal anaesthesia should not be used in young children, vertebral abnormalities, sepsis in the region of lumbar puncture site, hypotension and shock.

1895—DRUGS ACTING ON CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEMEpidural AnaesthesiaLA is injected into epidural space (thoracic or lumbar region or sacral canal) where it acts on spinal nerve roots. Lignocaine and bupivacaine are commonly used. It is safer, but the technique is more difficult than spinal anaesthesia. Epidural anaesthe-sia is slower in onset than spinal anaesthesia. It requires a much larger amount of the drug. Epidural analgesia is being used in obstetrics during labour. Low concen-tration of bupivacaine or ropivacaine is used to block pain sensation without sig-nificant motor block. Ropivacaine is less cardiotoxic and motor blockade is less than bupivacaine.Intravenous Regional Anaesthesia (Bier’s Block)It is mainly used in anaesthetizing the upper limb. Lignocaine and prilocaine are com-monly used. LA is injected into vein of the limb in which the blood ﬂow is occluded by a tourniquet.Drug Interactions 1. Lignocaine /H11003 propranolol: Propranolol by reducing hepatic blood ﬂow, impairs the clearance of lignocaine, which may result in toxicity. 2. Procaine /H11003 sulphonamides: Procaine is hydrolysed to PABA – reduces the effect of sulphonamides.Alcohols (Ethanol and Methanol)  PH1.20The actions of alcohol are depicted in Fig. 5.7.I Ethyl alcohol follows zero-order kinetics of elimination.I In chronic alcoholics, increased amount of toxic metabolite of paracetamol is formed as a result of induction of its metabolizing enzyme, CYP2E1.I As alcohol is present in exhaled air, it can be detected by breath analyser.Diuresis due toinhibition of ADH releaseKidneyCNSGITLocallyCVSRespiratorycentreLiverFall in bodytemperatureDose-dependent CNS depressionInitially apparent stimulation andlater depression• ↑Appetite• ↑Gastric acid secretion• Gastritis• Aggravation of peptic ulcer

190PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESTHERAPEUTIC USES OF ALCOHOL 1. Antiseptic: 70% ethyl alcohol is used as an antiseptic on skin before giving injec-tion and surgical procedure. Its antiseptic efﬁcacy decreases above 90%. It should not be used on open wounds, mucosa, ulcers and on scrotum as it is highly irri-tant. It is not useful for disinfecting instruments as it promotes rusting. 2. Trigeminal and other neuralgias: Injection of alcohol directly into nerve trunk relieves pain by destroying them. 3. Prevent bedsores: Alcohol is used locally to prevent bedsores in bedridden patients. 4. Methanol poisoning: Ethanol competes with methanol for metabolic enzymes and saturates them. Hence, it prevents the formation of toxic metabolites of methanol (formaldehyde and formic acid). 5. Fever: Alcoholic sponges are useful to reduce body temperature.Acute Ethanol Overdosage (Acute Alcohol Intoxication).  The signs and symptoms of acute alcohol intoxication are drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, ataxia, hypotension, respira-tory depression, hypoglycaemia, etc.Treatment (Note A–G).  It is a medical emergency. The main aim of therapy is to prevent severe respiratory depression and aspiration of vomitus. 1. Maintain Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Fluid and Electrolyte balance, and Gastric lavage if necessary. 2. Intravenous glucose to correct hypoglycaemia. 3. Thiamine is administered as i.v. infusion in glucose solution. 4. HaemoDialysis helps to hasten the recovery.Withdrawal Syndrome.  Sudden reduction/stoppage of alcohol in chronic alcoholics results in alcohol withdrawal syndrome. It manifests as restlessness, tremors, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, hallucinations, delirium, convulsions and collapse.Treatment of Alcohol Withdrawal SyndromeI BZDs (diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, etc.) are used to control anxiety, tremor, pal-pitation, sleep disturbances, confusion and convulsions associated with alcohol withdrawal.I Psychological support.Treatment of Chronic Alcoholism  PH1.23I Psychotherapy, occupational therapy and rehabilitationI Drug treatment of chronic alcoholism (a) Disulﬁram (alcohol aversion therapy): It causes aversion to alcohol.AlcoholAcetaldehydeAcetic acidAldehyde dehydrogenaseAlcohol dehydrogenaseDisulfiramDisulﬁram inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase and causes accumulation of acet-aldehyde in blood and tissues (acetaldehyde syndrome). The signs and symptoms include nausea, vomiting, ﬂushing, headache, sweating, tachycar-dia, palpitation, breathlessness, chest pain, hypotension, hypoglycaemia, confusion, shock and even death. This reaction is unpleasant; hence, person on disulﬁram develops aversion to alcohol.

1915—DRUGS ACTING ON CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEMDrugs like metronidazole, griseofulvin and cefoperazone also have disulﬁram-like action and produce similar reaction with alcohol. Doctors should warn the patient not to take alcohol and alcohol-containing products when they are on above-mentioned drugs. (b) Naltrexone (opioid antagonist): It reduces alcohol craving and helps to maintain abstinence. (c) Acamprosate: It activates GABAA receptors and reduces relapse. (d) Ondansetron (5-HT3 antagonist): It reduces alcohol consumption. (e) Topiramate: It decreases craving for alcohol.METHANOL POISONING (METHYL ALCOHOL POISONING)  PH1.21This occurs when methylated spirit is consumed or when liquor is adulterated  with methyl alcohol. Methanol is a mild CNS depressant. It is metabolized to formalde-hyde and formic acid which, in turn, cause metabolic acidosis and injury to retina.  The signs and symptoms of methanol poisoning are nausea, vomiting, abdominal  pain, headache, vertigo, confusion, hypotension, convulsions and coma. Metabolic aci-dosis is due to formic acid which also causes dimness of vision, retinal damage and blindness.Treatment 1. Patient is kept in a dark room to protect the eyes from light. 2. Maintain airway, breathing and circulation. 3. Gastric lavage is done after endotracheal intubation. 4. Intravenous sodium bicarbonate is given to correct acidosis and to prevent retinal damage. 5. Ethanol (10%) is administered via nasogastric tube. Ethanol competes with methanol for metabolic enzymes and saturates them, thus prevents formation of toxic metabolites (formaldehyde and formic acid). Methanol is excreted un-changed in urine and breath.Formic acidFormaldehydeAlcohol dehydrogenaseMethanolAldehyde dehydrogenaseEthanolAcetaldehydeAcetic acidRespiratory  depressionRetinal  damageAcidosis 6. Fomepizole, an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor, is the preferred agent for the treatment of methanol poisoning. CNS depression is rare with fomepizole as com-pared to ethanol. It can also be used in ethylene glycol poisoning. 7. Calcium leucovorin is administered intravenously (folate adjuvant therapy) to enhance metabolism of formate, thereby decreasing its levels. 8. Haemodialysis is done to promote excretion of methanol and its toxic metabolites.

192PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESAntiepileptic Drugs  PH1.19Epilepsy is a Greek word that means convulsions. Epilepsy is a disorder of brain func-tion characterized by paroxysmal cerebral dysrhythmia. Major types of epilepsy are shown below.Generalized seizures1. Generalized tonic–clonic seizures2. Absence seizures3. Myoclonic seizuresPartial seizures 1. Simple partial seizures2. Complex partial seizuresEpilepsy
GENERALIZED SEIZURES 1 .  Generalized tonic–clonic seizures (GTCS, grand mal epilepsy): It is charac-terized by the following sequence of symptoms: Aura–epileptic cry–loss of  consciousness–fall to the ground–tonic phase–clonic phase–period of relaxation–postepileptic automatism with confusional states. 2. Absence seizures (petit mal epilepsy): It is characterized by sudden onset of star-ing, unresponsiveness with momentary loss of consciousness. 3. Myoclonic seizures: It consists of single or multiple sudden, brief, shock-like con-tractions.PARTIAL SEIZURES 1. Simple partial seizures (SPS): The manifestations depend on the region of cortex involved. There may be convulsions (focal motor symptoms) or paraesthesia (sen-sory symptoms) without loss of consciousness. 2. Complex partial seizures (CPS, temporal lobe epilepsy, psychomotor epilepsy): It is characterized by aura–amnesia–abnormal behaviour and automatism with impaired consciousness.CHEMICAL CLASSIFICATION OF ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS 1.

MECHANISM OF ACTION OF ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS (Fig. 5.8A and B)Phenytoin (Diphenylhydantoin)Phenytoin is one of the most commonly used antiepileptic drugs. It has a selective anti-epileptic effect and does not produce signiﬁcant drowsiness.Mechanism of Action.  Phenytoin acts by stabilizing neuronal membrane (Fig. 5.9) and prevents spread of seizure discharges. The sodium channels exist in three forms: resting, activated and inactivated states. Phenytoin delays recovery of Na/H11001 channels from inac-tivated state, thereby reduces neuronal excitability (Fig. 5.9) and inhibits high-frequency ﬁring.At high concentrations, phenytoin inhibits Ca2/H11001 inﬂux into neuron, reduces gluta-mate levels and increases responses to GABA.Pharmacokinetics.  Phenytoin is absorbed slowly through the GI tract, widely distributed and highly (about 90%) bound to plasma proteins. It is almost completely metabolized in liver by hydroxylation and glucuronide conjugation. Repeated administration of  phenytoin causes enzyme induction and increases the rate of metabolism of co- administered drugs. Phenytoin exhibits dose-dependent elimination, i.e. at low concen-tration (/H1102110 mcg/mL), elimination occurs by ﬁrst-order kinetics and plasma half-life is

10–24 hours; as the rate of administration increases, the metabolizing enzymes get  saturated, kinetics changes to zero order, and plasma half-life increases to 60 hours;  the plasma concentration increases markedly with slight increase in dose resulting  in toxicity. Hence, therapeutic monitoring of phenytoin is essential for adjustment of dosage.

Fig. 5.9 Mechanism of action of phenytoin.Uses.  Phenytoin is used for the treatment of: 1. Generalized tonic–clonic seizures (grand mal epilepsy). 2. Partial seizures. 3. Trigeminal and other neuralgias. 4. Status epilepticus: Phenytoin is administered intravenously in normal saline (it precipitates in glucose solution).Adverse Effects (Note the ‘H’s).  Phenytoin has dose-dependent toxicity. The adverse ef-fects are as follows: 1. Hypertrophy and Hyperplasia of gums (due to defect in collagen catabolism) – seen on chronic therapy and can be minimized by proper oral hygiene. 2. Hypersensitivity reactions include skin rashes, neutropenia and rarely Hepatic necrosis. 3. Hirsutism – due to increased androgen secretion. 4. Hyperglycaemia – due to decreased insulin release. 5. Megaloblastic anaemia – due to folate deﬁciency. 6. Osteomalacia – due to increased metabolism of vitamin D. 7. Hypocalcaemia – due to decreased absorption of Ca2/H11001 from the gut. 8. Fetal Hydantoin syndrome – cleft lip, cleft palate, digital Hypoplasia, etc. due to use of phenytoin during pregnancy.At high concentration, phenytoin may cause the following side effects: 1. CNS: Vestibulocerebellar syndrome – vertigo, ataxia, tremor, headache, nystag-mus, psychological disturbances, etc. occur on chronic therapy. 2. CVS: Hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias may occur on i.v. administration; extravasation of the drug causes local tissue necrosis. 3. GIT: Nausea, vomiting and dyspepsia can be minimized by giving phenytoin after food.FosphenytoinIt is a prodrug of phenytoin, which is converted to phenytoin by phosphatases. Dose of fosphenytoin is expressed as phenytoin equivalents (PE). It is available for i.m. and i.v. 

196PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESadministration. Fosphenytoin can be administered in normal saline or glucose. It has signiﬁcantly less irritant effect on the veins than phenytoin. It is preferred to phenytoin in status epilepticus because of above advantages. The rate of i.v. infusion should not exceed 150 mg PE/minute. Hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias may occur with rapid administration.Carbamazepine (Iminostilbene)Carbamazepine is chemically related to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).Mechanism of Action.  Like phenytoin, carbamazepine slows the rate of recovery of Na/H11001 channels from inactivation, thereby reduces neuronal excitability.Pharmacokinetics.  Carbamazepine is absorbed slowly and erratically from GI tract, binds to plasma proteins, is well distributed in the body including the cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) and metabolized in liver. One of its metabolites retains anticonvulsant activity. Repeated use causes enzyme induction and reduces the effectiveness of the drug itself (autoinduc-tion) as well as that of valproate, phenytoin, lamotrigine, topiramate, OC pills, etc.Adverse Effects.  The common adverse effects of carbamazepine include sedation, drowsiness, vertigo, ataxia, diplopia, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting and confusion. Hypersensitivity re-actions are skin rashes, eosinophilia, lymphadenopathy and hepatitis. Rarely, it causes bone marrow depression with neutropenia, aplastic anaemia and agranulocytosis. On chronic therapy, it may cause water retention due to the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH).Uses 1. Carbamazepine is one of the most commonly used antiepileptic drugs. It is the drug of choice in GTCS and partial (SPS and CPS) seizures. 2. Carbamazepine is the drug of choice in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgias. It inhibits high-frequency discharges. The other drugs useful are phenytoin, gabap-entin, TCAs (amitriptyline), etc. Other treatment options are surgical division, cryosurgery, injection of alcohol or phenol in close proximity to nerve or ganglia. It is not effective for diabetic neuropathy. 3. It is used in the treatment of acute mania and bipolar disorder.Oxcarbazepine (Iminostilbene)Oxcarbazepine is an analogue of carbamazepine. Mechanism of action and therapeutic uses are similar to carbamazepine. It is a prodrug and is converted to active form after administration. Its enzyme-inducing property is much less; hence, drug interactions are few. It is less potent and less hepatotoxic than carbamazepine.EslicarbazepineIt is similar in structure to carbamazepine. It is useful for treatment of partial seizures.Phenobarbitone (Barbiturate)Phenobarbitone is a barbiturate and was widely used as an antiepileptic drug. Its use has declined because of availability of safer drugs. It acts by potentiating GABA activity. Phenobarbitone is absorbed slowly but completely after oral administration; about 50% is bound to plasma proteins. Repeated administration causes enzyme induction and reduces the effectiveness of co-administered drugs.Adverse Effects.  The most common side effect of phenobarbitone is sedation, but tolerance develops gradually with continued administration. The other side effects are 

1975—DRUGS ACTING ON CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEMnystagmus, ataxia, confusion, megaloblastic anaemia and skin rashes. On chronic  therapy, it may cause behavioural disturbances with impairment of memory in children (see Pharmacological actions of barbiturates on pp. 170–171).Uses.  Phenobarbitone is effective in GTCS and partial seizures. It is the cheapest antiepileptic drug. It is also useful in the prophylactic treatment of febrile convulsions. In status epilepticus, phenobarbitone is injected intravenously when convulsions are not controlled with diazepam and phenytoin.Ethosuximide (Succinimide)It is effective for the treatment of absence seizures. It acts by inhibiting T-type Ca2/H11001 current in thalamic neurons. It is completely absorbed after oral administration. The common side effects are GI disturbances like nausea, vomiting and anorexia. The other side effects are headache, hiccough, eosinophilia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia with bone marrow depression and rarely skin rashes.Valproic Acid (Sodium Valproate): Carboxylic Acid DerivativeSodium valproate is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug.Mechanism of Action 1. Like phenytoin and carbamazepine, valproate delays the recovery of Na/H11001 channels from inactivation. 2. Like ethosuximide, it blocks T-type Ca2/H11001 current in thalamic neurons. 3. Increases the activity of GABA in the brain by: (a) Increased synthesis of GABA by stimulating GAD (glutamic acid decarboxyl-ase) enzyme. (b) Decreased degradation of GABA by inhibiting GABA-T (GABA-transaminase) enzyme.Pharmacokinetics.  Valproate is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the GI tract, highly (about 90%) bound to plasma proteins, metabolized in liver and excreted in urine.Adverse Effects (Note the Mnemonic V ALPROATE) 1. The common side effects related to GI tract are nausea, Vomiting, Anorexia and abdominal discomfort. 2. CNS side effects include sedation, ataxia and tremor. 3. A rare but serious complication is fulminant hepatitis (Liver), hence avoided in children younger than 3 years. Monitoring of hepatic function is essential during valproate therapy; Elevation of liver enzymes occurs. 4. Teratogenicity: Orofacial and digital abnormalities; neural tube defects with in-creased incidence of spina biﬁda, so it should not be given during pregnancy. 5. The other adverse effects include skin Rashes, Alopecia and curling of hair; acute Pancreatitis may occur rarely.Uses.  Sodium valproate is highly effective in absence, myoclonic, partial (SPS and CPS) and generalized tonic–clonic seizures. Other uses of valproate are mania, bipolar disor-der and migraine prophylaxis.Divalproex: It contains valproic acid and sodium valproate in 1:1 ratio. It is adminis-tered orally. It causes less GI side effects than valproic acid.

198PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESDiazepam, Lorazepam, Clonazepam (Benzodiazepines)Diazepam and lorazepam are effective in controlling status epilepticus. Intravenous  diazepam is used in the emergency treatment of status epilepticus, tetanus, eclamptic convul-sions, febrile convulsions, drug-induced convulsions, etc. Diazepam has a rapid onset but short duration of action; hence, repeated doses are required. Diazepam can be administered rectally in children during emergency. Lorazepam is preferred in status epilepticus because: 1. It has a rapid onset and long duration of action. 2. It has less damaging effect on injected vein.Clonazepam, a long-acting BZD, is used in absence and myoclonic seizures.Mechanism of Action (See p. 166)Adverse Effects.  Intravenous  diazepam and lorazepam may cause hypotension and respi-ratory depression. The main side effects of clonazepam are sedation and lethargy, but tolerance develops on chronic therapy. Other side effects are hypotonia, dysarthria, dizzi-ness and behavioural disturbances like irritability, hyperactivity and lack of concentration.Newer AntiepilepticsThese are lamotrigine, topiramate, zonisamide, lacosamide, gabapentin, pregabalin,  tiagabine, vigabatrin and levetiracetam.

AnalgesicsAnalgesics are drugs that relieve pain without signiﬁcantly altering consciousness. They relieve pain without affecting its cause.AnalgesicsOpioid(narcotic analgesics)Nonopioid(nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs)Opioid Analgesics  PH1.19Morphine is the most important alkaloid of opium – the dried juice obtained from the capsules of Papaver somniferum. Opium contains many other alkaloids, e.g. codeine, thebaine, papaverine, etc. The term ‘opiates’ refers to drugs derived from opium poppy, whereas ‘opioid analgesic’ applies to any substance (endogenous peptides or drugs), which produces morphine-like analgesia.

202PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESCLASSIFICATION OF OPIOIDS 1. Opioid agonists (a) Natural opium alkaloids: Morphine, codeine, thebaine,* papaverine,* noscapine.* (b) Semisynthetic opiates: Heroin, pholcodine,* hydromorphone, oxymorphone. (c) Synthetic opioids: Pethidine, tramadol, tapentadol, methadone, dextropro-poxyphene, fentanyl, alfentanil, sufentanil, remifentanil. 2. Opioid agonist–antagonists: Pentazocine, butorphanol, nalorphine, nalbuphine. 3. Partial /H9262-receptor agonist and /H9260-receptor antagonist: Buprenorphine.Note: *Have no analgesic activity.OPIOID RECEPTORSThe three main types of opioid receptors are /H9262 (mu), /H9260 (kappa) and /H9254 (delta). These receptor-mediated effects are given below./H9262: Analgesia (spinal /H11001 supraspinal level), respiratory depression, dependence, sedation, euphoria, miosis, decrease in GI motility./H9260: Analgesia (spinal /H11001 supraspinal level), respiratory depression, dependence, dysphoria, psychotomimetic effect./H9254: Analgesia (spinal /H11001 supraspinal level), respiratory depression, proconvulsant action.OPIOID AGONISTSMechanism of ActionMorphine and other opioids produce their actions by interacting with various opioid receptors – mu (/H9262), delta (/H9254) and kappa (/H9260). They are located at spinal, supraspinal (medulla, midbrain, limbic system and cortical areas) and peripheral nerves. Morphine is the prototype drug.Pharmacological Actions of Morphine.  Morphine has mainly CNS-depressant effects but also has stimulant effects at certain sites in the CNS. 1. CNS (a) The depressant effects: (i) Analgesic effect: M ediated mainly thr ough /H9262-receptors at spinal and supraspinal sites (central action), it is the most important action of morphine. At the spinal level, it decreases release of excitatory neu-rotransmitters from primary pain afferents in substantia gelatinosa of dorsal horn. The excitability of neurons in dorsal horn is decreased. In the supraspinal level, it alters transmission of pain impulses. It is a very potent and efficacious analgesic. It causes sedation, drowsiness, eupho-ria, makes the person calm and raises the pain threshold. Perception of pain and reaction to it (fear, anxiety and apprehension) are altered by these drugs. Moderate doses of morphine relieve dull and continuous pain, whereas sharp, severe intermittent pain such as traumatic or vis-ceral pain requires larger doses of morphine. Opioids also act peripher-ally to alter the sensitivity of small nerve endings in the skin to painful stimuli associated with tissue injury/inflammation.

• Fear• Anxiety• Apprehension (reaction to pain)Sick feeling associated with illness (because of euphoriant effect)MorphinerelievesPainTherefore, morphine relieves ‘total pain’ . (ii) Euphoria (feeling of well-being): It is an important component of anal-gesic effect. Anxiety, fear, apprehension associated with painful illness or injury are reduced by opioids. (iii) Sedation: Morphine, in therapeutic doses, causes drowsiness and de-creases physical activity. (iv) Respiratory depression: It depresses respiration by a direct effect on the respiratory centre in the medulla; both rate and depth are reduced be-cause it reduces sensitivity of respiratory centre to CO2. Respiratory de-pression is the commonest cause of death in acute opioid poisoning. (v) Cough suppression: It has a direct action on cough centre in the medulla. (vi) Hypothermia: In high doses, morphine depresses temperature-regulating centre and produces hypothermia. (b) The stimulant effects: (i) Miosis: Morphine produces constriction of pupils due to stimulation of III cranial nerve nucleus. Some tolerance develops to this action. Pin-point pupils are an important feature in acute morphine poisoning. Miosis is not seen on topical application of morphine to the eye. (ii) Nausea and vomiting: It is due to direct stimulation of the CTZ in  medulla. 5-HT3 antagonists are the drugs of choice to control opioid-induced nausea and vomiting. H1-blockers, such as cyclizine or pro-chlorperazine may also be used.*Mnemonic for actions of morphine: ‘MARPHINE CVS’ .

204PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES (iii) Vagal centre: It stimulates vagal centre in the medulla and can cause bradycardia. (c) Other effects:Physical and psychological dependence: Repeated use of opioids causes phys-ical and psychological dependence. 2. CVS: Morphine produces vasodilatation and fall of BP .MorphinecausesDepression of VMCHistamine releaseDirect action on blood vesselVasodilatationHypotensionIt mainly causes vasodilatation of peripheral vessels, which results in shift of blood from pulmonary to systemic vessels leading to relief of pulmonary oedema associated with acute left ventricular failure. 3. GIT: It causes constipation by direct action on GI tract and CNS – decreases GI motility and increases tone of the sphincters. 4. Urinary bladder: It may cause urinary retention by increasing tone of urethral sphincter. 5. Biliary tract: It increases intrabiliary pressure by increasing tone of sphincter of Oddi. 6. Histamine release: Morphine is a histamine liberator and causes itching, skin rashes, urticaria, vasodilatation, bronchoconstriction, etc.Pharmacokinetics.  On oral administration, morphine is absorbed slowly and errati-cally. It also undergoes extensive ﬁrst-pass metabolism; hence, oral bioavailability of morphine is poor. Morphine is commonly administered by i.v., i.m. or s.c. routes. It can also be administered by oral, epidural or intrathecal routes. It is widely distributed in the body, crosses placental barrier and is metabolized in liver by glucuronide conjugation. Morphine-6-glucuronide has more potent analgesic action than morphine and is ex-creted in urine.Adverse Effects  PH1.19 1. Nausea, vomiting and constipation. 2. Respiratory depression. 3. Hypotension due to vasodilatation. 4. Drowsiness, confusion and mental clouding. 5. Itching (due to histamine release) and skin rashes. 6. Difﬁculty in micturition. 7. Respiratory depression in newborn due to administration of morphine to the mother during labour. 8. Drug tolerance develops to most of the effects of morphine (some tolerance develops to miotic effect). There is cross-tolerance among the opioids. 9. Seizure threshold is lowered. 10. Drug dependence (physical and psychological dependence) is the main draw-back of opioid therapy. Psychological dependence is associated with intense crav-ing for the drug. Physical dependence is associated with the development  of withdrawal symptoms (abstinence syndrome) when administration of an  opioid is stopped abruptly. The symptoms and signs are irritability, body shakes, 

2055—DRUGS ACTING ON CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEMyawning, lacrimation, sweating, fever, diarrhoea, palpitation, insomnia, rise in BP , loss of weight, etc. (the symptoms are just opposite to morphine actions). Dependence is mediated through /H9262-receptors.Treatment of  morphine dependence: (a) Hospitalization of the patient. (b) Gradual withdrawal of morphine. (c) Substitution therapy with methadone. Opioid agonist like methadone is preferred because: (i) It is orally effective. (ii) It has longer duration of action. (iii) Withdrawal symptoms are mild.1 mg of methadone will substitute 4 mg of morphine. Later, methadone is gradually reduced and completely stopped within 10 days. Bu-prenorphine can also be used for the treatment of opioid dependence. (d) Pure opioid antagonist like naltrexone is used after detoxiﬁcation to produce opioid blockade to prevent relapse in patients who have a sincere desire to leave the habit. It is the preferred antagonist because it is orally effective and has a long duration of action. (e) Psychotherapy, occupational therapy, community treatment and rehabilitation.    PH1.23 11. Acute morphine poisoning: The characteristic triad of symptoms are respiratory depression, pinpoint pupils and coma. The other signs and symptoms are  cyanosis, hypotension, shock and convulsions. Death is usually due to respiratory depression.Treatment of  acute morphine poisoning: 1. Hospitalization. 2. Maintain airway, breathing and circulation. 3. Ventilatory support (positive pressure respiration). 4. Gastric lavage with potassium permanganate. 5. Speciﬁc antidote: Naloxone 0.4–0.8 mg intravenously; dose is repeated till respiration becomes normal. Naloxone is a pure antagonist, competitively blocks opioid receptors and rapidly reverses the respiratory depression  (Fig. 5.10). The duration of action of naloxone is short; hence, repeated administration is needed.Note: Administration of naloxone to morphine addicts should be done with caution because it may precipitate severe withdrawal symptoms.Contraindications 1. Head injury: Morphine is contraindicated in cases with head injury because: (a) Vomiting, miosis and mental clouding produced by morphine interfere with assessment of progress in head injury patients. (b) Morphine n Respiratory depression n CO2 retention n Cerebral vasodila-tion nhh Intracranial tension. 2. Bronchial asthma: Morphine may cause severe bronchospasm due to histamine release.Morphine(Agonist)Opioid receptors Naloxone(Antagonist)Fig. 5.10 Competitive antagonism.

206PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES 3 .  COPD: It should be avoided in patients with low respiratory reserve – emphysema, chronic bronchitis, cor pulmonale, etc. 4. Hypotensive states: It should be used cautiously in shock or when there is reduced blood volume. 5. Hypothyroidism and hypopituitarism: There is a prolonged and exaggerated response to morphine. 6. Infants and elderly: They are more prone to respiratory depressant effect of morphine. In elderly male, there is an increased chance of urinary retention. 7. Undiagnosed acute abdominal pain: Morphine, if given before diagnosis interferes with diagnosis by masking the pain. Its spasmogenic effect may aggravate the pain (biliary colic).Codeine: Natural Opium Alkaloid 1. Codeine has analgesic and cough-suppressant effects; it is administered orally. 2. Compared to morphine: (a) It is less potent and less efﬁcacious as an analgesic. (b) It has less respiratory depressant effect. (c) It is less constipating. (d) It has low addiction liability. 3. It has selective cough suppressant effect (antitussive), hence used to suppress dry cough. 4. It potentiates analgesic effect of aspirin and paracetamol.Codeine is used for relief of moderate pain. The main side effects are constipation and sedation.Pholcodine: see p. 255Pethidine (Meperidine) (Table 5.12).  Pethidine is a synthetic opioid; it has some anticho-linergic actions. Dry mouth and tachycardia can occur.It can be administered by oral, i.v., s.c. and i.m. routes. It is well absorbed from the GI tract, but bioavailability is about 50% because of ﬁrst-pass effect; widely distributed in the body, crosses placental barrier and is metabolized in liver. The metabolites are excreted in urine.Adverse Effects.  The adverse effects of pethidine are similar to those of morphine. It can cause tremors, hallucinations, muscle twitches and rarely convulsions due to its metabolite, norpethidine. T olerance, physical and psychological dependence can also develop with pethidine.Diphenoxylate.  It is a pethidine congener and is useful in the treatment of diarrhoea. It is available in combination with atropine. It is rarely used at present because of its side effect (paralytic ileus).Loperamide.  Loperamide is a pethidine congener. It reduces GI motility and secretions but increases the tone of anal sphincter. It is used in the symptomatic treatment of diar-rhoea. Common side effects are constipation and abdominal cramps.Therapeutic Uses of Opioids 1. As analgesic (Fig. 5.11): Morphine and other opioids are potent and efﬁcacious analgesics, hence used for moderate to severe painful conditions, such as acute myocardial infarction (MI), burns, pulmonary embolism, fracture mandible and

In renal and biliary colic, atropine is used with morphine to counteract spasmogenic effect of morphine. Opioids are the preferred analge-sics in severe painful conditions (WHO analgesic ladder) (Fig. 5.11).Patient controlled analgesia: This allows the patient to control the delivery of s.c., epidural or i.v. analgesic in a safe and effective way through a pump. The patient should inform nurse when he or she takes a dose so that it can be replaced.

208PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES 2. Preanaesthetic medication: Opioids like morphine and pethidine are used about half an hour before anaesthesia because of their sedative, analgesic and euphoric effects; the dose of anaesthetic required is reduced. 3. Acute pulmonary oedema (cardiac asthma): i.v. morphine relieves breathlessness associated with acute left ventricular failure due to pulmonary oedema by: (a) Reducing preload on heart by peripheral vasodilatation. (b) Shifting blood from pulmonary to systemic circulation. (c) Reducing anxiety, fear and apprehension associated with illness. 4. Postanaesthetic shivering – pethidine is effective. 5. Cough: Codeine and dextromethorphan are used for suppression of dry cough. 6. Diarrhoea: Synthetic opioids such as loperamide and diphenoxylate are used for symptomatic treatment of diarrhoea.Other OpioidsThe route of administration, uses and important features are represented in Table 5.13.OpioidActions and usesImportant adverse  effects• Codeine (p.o.) metabolized to morphine• Analgesia – less potent than morphine• Cough suppressant – more selective for cough centre• Constipation• Low addiction liabilityPethidine (i.m., i.v., s.c.)• Synthetic opioid• Rapid but short acting• No signiﬁcant antitussive effectAnalgesic – less potent than morphine• Similar to morphine (urinary retention, consti-pation less common)• Anticholinergic effects – dry mouth, tachycardia• Seizures, tremors (due to norpethidine)• With SSRI n serotonin syndromeAction on smooth muscleHistamine  release}Less than morphineMethadone (p.o., i.m.)• µ-Receptor agonist• Oral route: well absorbed• Long duration of action• Repeated dosing: persistent action• Substitution therapy in opioid dependence• Actions similar to morphine• Tolerance, dependence more slowly than morphine• Withdrawal symptoms – mild• 1 mg methadone substituted for 4 mg of morphine• Uses – substitution therapy in opioid dependent subjects; for chronic painSimilar to morphine

210PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESTramadol.  It is a synthetic codeine derivative with weak agonistic activity at /H9262-receptors. It also inhibits the reuptake of NA and 5-HT. It decreases seizure threshold.T apentadol. It is a /H9262-agonist. It also predominantly inhibits reuptake of NE than 5-HT into the neurons. It is useful in mild to moderate pain. Adverse effects are similar to tramadol but vomiting is less.Fentanyl.  It is a synthetic opioid with a potent /H9262-agonistic effect (100 times more potent than morphine as an analgesic).Pharmacological actions are similar to morphine. Alfentanil, sufentanil and remifen-tanil are short-acting fentanyl analogues. They are useful for short procedures where intense analgesia is required.Methadone.  It is a synthetic opioid with agonistic effect at /H9262-receptors and has a long duration of action. Pharmacological actions are similar to morphine.Dextropropoxyphene.  It is structurally similar to methadone. The side effects are nausea, constipation, sedation, abdominal pain, etc. It may cause cardiotoxicity and pulmonary oedema.Opioid Agonist–Antagonists and Partial AgonistsPentazocine.  Pentazocine is an opioid agonist–antagonist. It has agonistic action at /H9260- and weak antagonistic action at /H9262-receptors. In low doses, its pharmacological actions are almost similar to that of morphine. In higher doses, it causes sympathetic stimulation.Buprenorphine.  It is a partial /H9262-receptor agonist and /H9260-receptor antagonist; it is about 25 times more potent than morphine as analgesic. The pharmacological actions are qualitatively similar to morphine but it has a delayed onset and prolonged duration of action. It can be administered by parenteral and sublingual routes.Opioid Antagonists: Naloxone, Naltrexone and Nalmefene (Fig. 5.10)They are pure opioid antagonists. These drugs have no agonistic activity.Naloxone, naltrexone and nalmefene competitively reverse the effects of both natural and synthetic opioids, but do not completely reverse buprenorphine-induced respira-tory depression. Naloxone also blocks analgesic effect of placebo and acupuncture, and effects of endogenous opioid peptides. It is orally not effective because of high ﬁrst-pass metabolism. It is short acting. On i.v. administration, it immediately antagonizes all the actions, especially respiratory depression, of morphine and other opioids. i.v. naloxone precipitates withdrawal symptoms in morphine and heroin addicts.Uses of Naloxone 1. The main therapeutic use of naloxone is for the treatment of morphine and other opioid poisoning (see p. 205). 2. In the treatment of opioid overdosage, i.v. naloxone rapidly reverses respiratory depression induced by opioids (except buprenorphine where it causes partial  reversal of respiratory depression). 3. T o treat neonatal asphyxia due to use of opioids in the mother during labour.Uses of Naltrexone.  Naltrexone is orally more potent and has longer duration of action than naloxone.

2115—DRUGS ACTING ON CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM 1. Naltrexone is used for opioid blockade therapy to prevent relapse in opioid-dependent individuals. 2. It is also used for the treatment of alcoholism, as it reduces the urge to drink.Methylnaltrexone, a derivative of naltrexone, has only peripheral actions. It can be used for treatment of constipation due to opioids.NalmefeneI It is administered intravenously.I It is longer acting than naloxone.I It is useful in the treatment of opioid overdosage.Endogenous Opioid PeptidesEndorphins, enkephalins and dynorphins are naturally occurring substances present in the brain and other body tissues. They are called endogenous opioid peptides because their effects are similar to opium alkaloids (e.g. morphine) in their actions. These  peptides appear to be involved in placebo and acupuncture-induced analgesia.Antiparkinsonian Drugs  PH1.19Parkinson disease (PD) was ﬁrst described by Sir James Parkinson. It is characterized by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia (slowness of movements) and the loss of postural reﬂexes.In idiopathic parkinsonism, there is degeneration of the dopamine-containing neu-rons in the substantia nigra, resulting in dopamine deﬁciency. Hence, the balance be-tween inhibitory dopaminergic neurons and excitatory cholinergic neurons is disturbed resulting in relative cholinergic overactivity (Fig. 5.12).CLASSIFICATION 1. Drugs inﬂuencing brain dopaminergic system: (a) Dopamine precursor: Levodopa (L-Dopa). (b) Dopamine agonists: Bromocriptine, pramipexole, ropinirole. (c) NMDA-receptor antagonist: Amantadine. (d) Monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitors: Selegiline (deprenyl), rasagiline. (e) Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors: T olcapone, entacapone. 2. Drugs inﬂuencing brain cholinergic system (a) Centrally acting anticholinergic drugs: Benztropine, benzhexol (trihexypheni-dyl), procyclidine, biperiden. (b) Antihistaminics (H1-blockers) with anticholinergic activity: Promethazine, diphenhydramine, orphenadrine.The main aim of drug therapy in parkinsonism is to either enhance dopamine activ-ity or reduce cholinergic activity in the striatum.DAAChLDAAChLLDA-inﬂuencing drugsAnticholinergic drugs(A)(B)(C)Fig. 5.12 (A) Normally, there is a balance between DA and ACh in the striatum; (B) parkinsonism – deﬁciency of DA leads to a relative increase in ACh activity; (C) balance between DA and ACh is restored with the use of antiparkinsonian drugs.

212PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESDopamine Precursor: LevodopaL-Dopa is the main drug for the treatment of idiopathic parkinsonism. Dopamine does not cross BBB; hence, its immediate precursor L-Dopa (prodrug) is used. It is converted to dopamine by decarboxylase enzyme in the dopaminergic neurons of the striatum. Dopamine produced then interacts with D2-receptors in the basal ganglia to produce antiparkinsonian effect. In early stages of the disease, improvement is almost complete. All the clinical symptoms (rigidity, bradykinesia and tremor) of parkinsonism improve, but the progression of the disease is not stopped. A large amount of the drug is con-verted to dopamine in the peripheral tissues by peripheral decarboxylase enzyme. Only a small amount (2%–3%) of L-Dopa enters the brain. Therefore, L-Dopa is used in combination with carbidopa/benserazide (peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor) which does not cross the BBB; the peripheral metabolism of L-Dopa is reduced, thus increasing its bioavailability in the basal ganglia (Fig. 5.13).Pharmacokinetics.  On oral administration, L-Dopa is rapidly absorbed from the small intestine by an active transport system. Amino acids present in food may interfere with the absorption of L-Dopa; hence, it should be given 30–60 minutes before meal. Active transport of L-Dopa into the brain may be inhibited by competition from dietary amino acids. The main metabolic products of L-Dopa are homovanillic acid (HV A) and 3,4- dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) (Fig. 5.14). The metabolites are excreted in urine.Adverse Effects 1. GIT: Nausea, vomiting and anorexia are common during initial treatment with L-Dopa. T olerance to emetic effect develops slowly. 2. CVS: The commonest cardiovascular side effect is postural hypotension, which is usually asymptomatic. It can also cause tachycardia, palpitation and rarely cardiac arrhythmias. 3. Dyskinesias (abnormal involuntary movements): Tics, tremors and choreoathe-toid movements may occur. T olerance does not develop to abnormal movements. 4. Alteration in taste sensation. 5. Mental changes like insomnia, confusion, delusions, euphoria, depression, anxiety, hallucinations and nightmares.Relieves symptoms of parkinsonismBBBIn the basal gangliaDopaInteracts withD2-receptorsLevodopadecarboxylaseDopamineCTZ D2-receptors• Nausea• VomitingPeripheralDopa-decarboxylaseDopamine• Tachycardia• PalpitationCarbidopa/benserazideBlood vessel• Postural hypotensionIn the peripheryLevodopaFig. 5.13 L-Dopa–carbidopa in parkinsonism.

(Source: Adapted from Alfred Gilman Sr. and Louis S. Goodman: Goodman & Gilman’s The Pharmaco-logical Basis of Therapeutics, 12th edition, p. 615, Fig. 22.5, McGraw Hill, 2018.) 6 .  Fluctuations in response: After 3–5 years of therapy, with progressing disease, con-trol becomes poor and ﬂuctuations in symptoms occur frequently. Wearing off (end-of-dose) is due to decrease in plasma concentration of L-Dopa towards the end-of-a-dose interval. Patient may show ﬂuctuation in response – being ‘off’ (loss of beneﬁcial effect of the drug) and being ‘on’ (relief of most of the symptoms but with disabling dyskinesias) called the on/off phenomenon. Sustained release formu-lation of L-Dopa –carbidopa produces more stable plasma L-Dopa levels and helps to reduce ﬂuctuation in response (on/off phenomena). End-of-dose deterioration can also be improved by administering L-Dopa in smaller and more frequent doses.Peripheral Decarboxylase Inhibitors: Carbidopa and BenserazideCarbidopa and benserazide are peripheral decarboxylase inhibitors. These drugs do not cross BBB. L-Dopa is always given in combination with carbidopa/benserazide. The cur-rently used combinations are as follows:I L-Dopa /H11001 carbidopa (4:1 or 10:1 ratio).I L-Dopa /H11001 benserazide (4:1 ratio).The advantages of these ﬁxed-dose combinations are as follows: 1. Increased bioavailability of dopamine in the basal ganglia (Fig. 5.13). Hence, the dose of L-Dopa can be reduced by 75%. 2. Prolongation of plasma half-life of L-Dopa. 3. Reduction in the incidence of GI side effects like nausea and vomiting.

214PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES 4. Cardiovascular side effects like tachycardia, hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias are minimized. 5. Better patient compliance. 6. Sustained release preparation of L-Dopa –carbidopa helps to reduce on/off phe-nomenon.Dopamine-Receptor Agonists: Bromocriptine, Ropinirole and PramipexoleThese drugs have direct action on dopamine receptors. Like L-Dopa, they can relieve signs and symptoms of parkinsonism. They are administered orally. The duration of action of these drugs is longer than that of L-Dopa and these are used particularly in patients who have frequent ﬂuctuation of symptoms (on/off phenomena).Bromocriptine.  Bromocriptine is an ergot derivative; it has agonistic action at D2- and partial agonist at D1-receptors.Adverse Effects.  Adverse effects include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, pos-tural hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, digital vasospasm, dyskinesias, headache, confu-sion, hallucinations and nasal congestion. It is contraindicated in patients with history of mental illness, recent MI, peptic ulcer and peripheral vascular diseases.Ropinirole and Pramipexole.  These are nonergoline derivatives; hence, ergot-related side effects are not seen. These drugs are often used in the initial treatment of parkin-sonism. They can be used as monotherapy in mild parkinsonism or in combination with  L-Dopa –carbidopa. They also exert neuroprotective effect. Dyskinesias and ﬂuctuation in response are less with these drugs than L-Dopa. The other indication of these noner-golines is in ‘restless leg syndrome’ .BromocriptineRopiniroleStrong D2-agonist andpartial agonist at D1More selective for D3PramipexoleD2-agonistAdverse Effects.  Nausea, vomiting, confusion, fatigue, somnolence, hallucinations, postural hypotension, dyskinesia and rarely, sudden attacks of irresistible sleep during day time. GIT side effects are lower as compared to bromocriptine.COMT Inhibitors: Tolcapone, EntacaponeT olcapone and entacapone are reversible COMT inhibitors. By inhibiting the peripheral metabolism of L-Dopa to 3-O-methyldopa, they increase the half-life of L-Dopa and also enhance its bioavailability in the CNS. The ‘on’ time is prolonged and the dose of L-Dopa can be reduced. T olcapone has both peripheral and central actions with rela-tively longer duration of action, whereas entacapone inhibits COMT only in the periph-ery (Fig. 5.14). These drugs are used as adjunct to L-Dopa –carbidopa for advanced cases of PD. Combined preparation of L-Dopa /H11001 carbidopa /H11001 entacapone is available.Adverse Effects.  These include dyskinesia, nausea, diarrhoea, confusion, hypotension and hallucinations. T olcapone may rarely cause fulminant hepatitis; hence, it should be avoided in patients with liver disease. Entacapone does not cause hepatotoxicity.MAO-B Inhibitors: Selegiline (Deprenyl) and RasagilineThey selectively and irreversibly inhibit MAO-B enzyme in the brain (Fig. 5.14). They are administered orally. They do not inhibit MAO in the periphery. They retard the  metabolism of DA in the brain and prevent the formation of toxic metabolites. Thus, they 

2155—DRUGS ACTING ON CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEMproduce neuroprotective effect in idiopathic PD and retard the progression of disease. They are used as an adjunct with L-Dopa. They enhance as well as prolong the effect of L-Dopa, thus reducing the dose of L-Dopa required. They also reduce ‘on-off ’ and ‘wear-ing off’ phenomena. Rasagiline is more potent and longer acting than selegiline; hence, single daily dose is adequate. The metabolites of selegiline are amphetamine and metham-phetamine which cause side effects like insomnia, anxiety, nausea and vomiting.NMDA-Receptor Antagonist: AmantadineAmantadine is an antiviral drug used for the treatment and prophylaxis of inﬂuenza A. It is also used in parkinsonism. It facilitates the synthesis and release of dopamine from dopaminergic neurons in the brain. It also has NMDA-receptor antagonist action –  decreases glutamate neurotransmission in the basal ganglia which could contribute to its beneﬁcial effect in parkinsonism. It is less effective than L-Dopa and hence used for the initial treatment of mild parkinsonism. Its therapeutic activity may be increased by combining with L-Dopa. It is given by oral route and is well tolerated.Adverse Effects.  They include headache, heart failure, hypotension, hallucinations, nau-sea, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, insomnia and livedo reticularis (discoloured patches on the skin).Central AnticholinergicsCentrally acting anticholinergics like benzhexol (trihexyphenidyl) and benztropine are the treatment of choice in drug-induced parkinsonism and are also effective in idio-pathic parkinsonism. They have mainly central anticholinergic action with minimal peripheral action. They act by reducing the increased cholinergic activity in the stria-tum. They are less effective than L-Dopa, but are cheap and better tolerated. They are mainly effective in relieving tremor and rigidity of parkinsonism with little effect on hypokinesia. Adverse effects are dry mouth, confusion, constipation, blurring of vision, drowsiness, hallucinations and urinary retention.Antihistaminics with anticholinergic action like promethazine, diphenhydramine and orphenadrine are also effective in decreasing cholinergic overactivity in basal ganglia.L-Dopa is not effective in drug-induced parkinsonism, because: (a) Dopamine receptors are blocked. (b) There is no deﬁciency of dopamine.Drug Interactions 1. L-Dopa /H11003 MAO inhibitors (nonselective): Inhibition of MAO retards the metabolism of dopamine n plasma concentration of dopamine increases n may precipitate hypertensive crisis. 2. L-Dopa /H11003 pyridoxine: Pyridoxine promotes the peripheral conversion of L-Dopa to dopamine and reduces the therapeutic effect of L-Dopa. 3. L-Dopa /H11003 antihypertensive agents: Worsening of postural hypotension. 4. L-Dopa /H11003 metoclopramide: Metoclopramide crosses the BBB, blocks the D2-receptors in the basal ganglia and causes drug-induced parkinsonism (i.e. inter-feres with antiparkinsonian effect of L-Dopa); domperidone poorly crosses BBB; hence, there is no interference with therapeutic effect of L-Dopa.Drugs for Alzheimer’s DiseaseIt is a degenerative disease of the cerebral cortex with decreased cholinergic transmis-sion. Drugs used are donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine. They are cerebroselective

2215—DRUGS ACTING ON CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEMClozapine and Olanzapine 1. Atypical antipsychotic drugs. 2. Mainly block 5-HT2 receptors. 3. Have weak D2-blocking effect. 4. Also block /H92511-receptors, H1- and muscarinic receptors. 5. Cause sedation and hypotension. 6. Rarely cause EPS.Adverse Effects (T able 5.17)  Side effects of clozapine are sedation, salivation, seizures, weight gain and hypotension. The dangerous side effect is agranulocytosis; hence, regular monitoring of blood counts is required during clozapine therapy. Side effects of olanzapine are dry mouth, constipation, weight gain and rarely EPS. It does not cause agranulocytosis.Uses.  Clozapine is a reserve drug for the treatment of schizophrenia because of the risk of agranulocytosis. Olanzapine is used for the treatment of schizophrenia and mania associated with bipolar disorder. They suppress both positive symptoms (thought disor-der, hallucinations, delusions, etc.) and negative symptoms (social withdrawal, lack of motivation and ﬂattening of emotions) of schizophrenia.Risperidone 1. Atypical antipsychotic drug. 2. Blocks D2-, 5-HT2, /H92511-adrenergic and H1-receptors. 3. EPS is rare at low doses. 4. Used for the treatment of schizophrenia and short-term treatment of mania associated with bipolar disorder.Other atypical antipsychotics are aripiprazole, ziprasidone, quetiapine and amisul-pride (Table 5.17).Therapeutic Uses 1. Schizophrenia: The neuroleptics are the only efﬁcacious drugs available for the treatment of schizophrenia (for effects in schizophrenia, see p. 218).The atypical antipsychotics are commonly prescribed owing to the lower risk of EPS. Risperidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone and quetiapine are frequently used. Clozapine is reserved for resistant cases of schizophrenia.  Of the older agents, haloperidol and ﬂuphenazine are commonly used. 2 .  Mania: Acute mania can be treated with a neuroleptic (chlorpromazine or haloperi-dol); lithium is used for maintenance therapy. Atypical antipsychotics like olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine and aripiprazole are commonly used for acute mania. If par-enteral therapy is required, older agents like chlorpromazine or haloperidol are used. 3. As antiemetic: These drugs (phenothiazines, haloperidol, etc.) produce anti-emetic effect by blocking D2-receptors in CTZ. However, they are not routinely used as antiemetics because of their side effects. Phenothiazine, such as prochlor-perazine, is useful for prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with migraine or emesis due to anticancer drugs. 4. Intractable hiccough has been treated with chlorpromazine. 5. As adjuvant with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in anxiety.Antianxiety Agents  PH1.19 1. Benzodiazepines (BZDs): BZDs are the preferred anxiolytic drugs. Chlordiaz-epoxide, diazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam, alprazolam, nitrazepam, ﬂurazepam, 

222PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESetc. are used as anxiolytic agents. They act on limbic system and facilitate the  inhibitory effect of GABA. BZDs are mainly useful for short-term treatment  of anxiety. They act rapidly and are most commonly used for acute anxiety.  Adverse effects are sedation, impairment of memory, confusion and dependence. T olerance may develop to anxiolytic effect on long-term use. 2. Buspirone: Buspirone is a partial agonist of 5-HT1A receptor and causes selective anxiolytic effect. It has no sedative, anticonvulsant or muscle relaxant effects. It does not potentiate the central effects of alcohol or other CNS depressants. There is no tolerance or drug dependence. It does not affect GABA transmission. Buspi-rone is well absorbed from GI tract; but bioavailability is low because of ﬁrst-pass metabolism. It produces active metabolites. Enzyme inducers (rifampin) and in-hibitors (erythromycin) alter its plasma levels. It is mainly used in the treatment of generalized anxiety states. But its effect is delayed and may take 2 weeks to fully develop. So, it is not effective for acute cases. 3 .  /H9252-Blockers: Propranolol and other nonselective /H9252-blockers are used mainly to re-duce the symptoms of anxiety, such as tachycardia, palpitation, tremor and sweating. 4. SSRIs and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI, venlafaxine): These are the preferred agents for most of the anxiety disorders, except acute anxiety. Response is delayed. 5. H1-blocker: Hydroxyzine is a highly sedative ﬁrst-generation H1-blocker; it has selective antianxiety action. It also has antiallergic, antiemetic and anticholinergic actions.Antidepressants  PH1.19Depression is a common clinical condition associated with feeling of sadness, loss of interest, self-neglect, anorexia, sleep disturbances, suicidal feelings in severe cases, etc. Various hypotheses have been proposed for pathogenesis of depression.I Decrease in levels or function of monoamines (5-HT, NE, DA) in cortical and limbic system.I Decrease in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).I Abnormalities in HPA axis, thyroid function and sex steroid levels.CLASSIFICATION 1.

All types of antidepressants take at least 2–3 weeks to produce beneficial effects. ↑5HT/NE in synaptic cleft → stimulation of presynaptic 5-HT1A/α2-receptors initially. Later, receptor desensitization occurs.

MOA, Mechanism of action; EC, effector cell; NE, norepinephrine; 5-HT serotonin; CNS, central nervous system.Pharmacokinetics.  TCAs are well absorbed through the GI tract and are highly bound to plasma proteins. They are widely distributed in tissues including CNS. They are  metabolized in liver. Some of them (imipramine, amitriptyline, etc.) produce active metabolites which are responsible for the long duration of action of these drugs. These drugs are excreted mainly in urine as inactive metabolites.Adverse Effects and Contraindications of Tricyclic Antidepressants (Fig. 5.16) 1. ‘Atropine-like’ side effects: Dryness of mouth, blurring of vision, constipation, urinary retention, etc. 2. /H92511-Adrenergic blocking effects: Postural hypotension, tachycardia, cardiac ar-rhythmias, etc. 3. H1-blocking effects: Sedation and confusion. 4. Other effects: Increased appetite, weight gain and may precipitate convulsions (seizure threshold is lowered).

224PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESTCAs are contraindicated in patients with glaucoma, epilepsy, ischaemic heart disease and enlarged prostate.Other antidepressants are shown in Table 5.18.MAO InhibitorsMAO is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the metabolism of biogenic amines. There are two isoforms of MAO. MAO-A is responsible mainly for the metabolism of NA, 5-HT and tyramine. MAO-B is more selective for dopamine metabolism.Moclobemide.  A selective and reversible inhibitor of MAO-A (RIMA) is relatively free of food and drug interactions. Hence, cheese reaction is rare.

So,  very little tyramine reaches systemic circulation. When a patient on MAO inhibitor consumes food stuff rich in tyramine, it may result in fatal hypertensive crisis and cere-brovascular accidents. The reaction can be treated with i.v. phentolamine (Fig. 5.17).

Depression: Antidepressants are used in the treatment of endogenous depression (major depression) and during the phase of depression in bipolar illness. Patient starts taking interest in daily activities, mood is elevated, concentration improves and agitation decreases. Patient becomes more responsive. SSRIs are preferred to TCAs because of: (a) Better tolerability. (b) Less side effects (do not cause hypotension and sedation; do not have anticho-linergic effects and no precipitation of convulsions, do not cause cardiac  arrhythmias). (c) Longer duration of action. 2. Anxiety disorders: SSRIs are used for the treatment of generalized anxiety disor-der. Onset of action is slow; hence, BZDs are co-administered for a short period to control anxiety during this period. SNRIs like venlafaxine and duloxetine are also useful in anxiety. 3. Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD): Clomipramine (TCA) and ﬂuvoxamine (SSRI) are highly effective. 4. ADHD: TCAs (imipramine, nortriptyline, etc.) are used in ADHD. Atomoxetine, methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine can also be used in this disorder. 5. Nocturnal enuresis: Imipramine is effective.

2275—DRUGS ACTING ON CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM 6. Prophylaxis of migraine: Amitriptyline is effective. 7. Chronic pain including neuralgias: TCAs are effective in trigeminal, herpetic and postherpetic neuralgias. Venlafaxine and duloxetine (SNRIs) are used in the treat-ment of ﬁbromyalgia. 8. Atopic dermatitis: T opical doxepin is useful; it has antipruritic action. 9 .  Premature ejaculation: SSRIs like paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline citalopram and dapoxetine are effective. Dapoxetine is taken 1 hour before intercourse  as it acts rapidly. If SSRIs are not tolerated, TCA like clomipramine can be used.Drugs for Bipolar Disorder  PH1.19Bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness) is a psychiatric disorder in which depression alternates with mania. Mania is an affective disorder that manifests as elation, agitation, hyperactivity, uncontrolled thought and speech.Drugs used in bipolar disorder are lithium, carbamazepine, sodium valproate, olan-zapine, risperidone, haloperidol, etc.LITHIUMLithium was the ﬁrst drug used for the treatment of mania. The antiepileptic drugs such as carbamazepine, sodium valproate and gabapentin have been approved for the treat-ment of bipolar disorder.Actions and MechanismLithium reduces motor activity, decreases euphoria, relieves insomnia and stabilizes the mood in patient with bipolar disorder.In the neuronal membrane:LithiumIP2IP1IP3DAGEffectsInositol/H11002/H11002IP2, inositol bisphosphate; IP1, inositol monophosphate; IP3, inositol triphosphate, DAG, diacylglycerol. 1. Lithium, by inhibiting the above steps, reduces the release of IP3 and DAG, which are second messengers for both /H9251-adrenergic and muscarinic transmission. 2. Lithium is a monovalent cation that can mimic the role of Na/H11001. 3. Lithium also decreases the release of NA and DA in the brain.Other ActionsI Lithium may produce nephrogenic diabetes insipidus by blocking the action of ADH on collecting duct.I Increases total WBC count (leukocytosis).I Inhibits the release of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4).

228PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESPharmacokineticsLithium carbonate is effective orally, does not bind to plasma proteins and is distributed throughout the total body water. It is not metabolized and gets excreted in urine, saliva, sweat, etc. Lithium is a monovalent cation. The kidney handles lithium in the same way as Na/H11001. About 80% of the ﬁltered lithium is reabsorbed in the proximal tubules. Sodium depletion reduces the rate of excretion of lithium and increases its toxicity. Lithium has low therapeutic index; hence, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is essential for opti-mal therapy (normal levels: 0.5–1.5 mEq/L). Estimation of salivary concentration can be used for noninvasive monitoring of lithium.Adverse Effects 1. GIT: Nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. 2. CNS: Tremor, ataxia, drowsiness, headache, muscular weakness and slurred speech. 3. Renal: Polyuria, polydipsia due to inhibition of ADH action. 4. Goitre with hypothyroidism may occur. 5. Acute lithium toxicity manifests as confusion, convulsions, cardiac arrhythmias, coma and death.Treatment 1. Lithium should be stopped immediately, and its serum level is estimated. 2. i.v. mannitol to promote lithium excretion. 3. i.v. normal saline to restore Na/H11001 levels, which in turn promotes the excretion of lithium. 4. Haemodialysis is indicated if the serum levels are very high (/H110224 mEq/L).Uses of LithiumIt is used as a prophylactic agent for bipolar disorder. It decreases the frequency and severity of both manic and depressive attacks; hence, it is called mood stabilizer. Lithium has a slow onset of action, hence not used for acute mania. Lithium is also useful in the prophylaxis of unipolar depression.Drug Interactions 1. Lithium /H11003 thiazides/furosemide: Thiazides and furosemide cause hyponatrae-mia. As a result, there will be a compensatory increase in the reabsorption of  Na/H11001 in PCT. Along with Na/H11001, reabsorption of lithium is also increased leading to toxicity. 2. Neuromuscular blockade induced by depolarizing (succinylcholine) and nonde-polarizing (pancuronium) neuromuscular blockers is prolonged in patients on lithium. 3. Lithium /H11003 haloperidol: Long-term lithium therapy may cause rigidity and potentiates the EPS of haloperidol.Other Drugs Used in Mania and Bipolar DisorderI Sodium valproate: It is the preferred drug for treatment of acute mania because of its rapid action, wider therapeutic index and better tolerability than lithium. It is also used prophylactically for bipolar disorder. It is used in combination with lithium or an antipsychotic. Divalproex can also be used.I Carbamazepine: Carbamazepine, an antiepileptic drug, has mood-stabilizing effect and is used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. It may be used alone or in 

2295—DRUGS ACTING ON CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEMcombination with lithium or valproate. It is less effective than valproate/lithium. It is used prophylactically in bipolar disorder as adjunct to lithium.I Antipsychotics: Olanzapine, risperidone, aripiprazole, quetiapine, etc. are preferred agents to control acute attack of mania. They can be used alone or  combined with BZD/sodium valproate/lithium in acute mania. Conventional an-tipsychotics like haloperidol and ﬂuphenazine are also useful.I Lamotrigine, newer antiepileptic agent, is found to be useful only for prophylaxis of depression in bipolar disorder. It can also be used with lithium.I BZDs like lorazepam or clonazepam are used as adjuncts if patient is agitated.

230CHAPTER 6Autacoids and Respiratory SystemAutacoids are produced by cells and act locally. Hence, they are also called ‘local  hormones’ . Various autacoids are histamine, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]), prostaglandins (PGs), leukotrienes, angiotensin, kinins and platelet-activating  factor (PAF).Histamine and Antihistamines  PH1.16Histamine is a biogenic amine present in many animal and plant tissues. It is also pres-ent in venoms and stinging secretions. It is synthesized by decarboxylation of the amino acid, histidine. It is mainly present in storage granules of mast cells in tissues like skin, lungs, liver, gastric mucosa and placenta. It is one of the mediators involved in inﬂammatory and hypersensitivity reactions.MECHANISM OF ACTION AND EFFECTS OF HISTAMINEHistamine exerts its effects by binding to histamine (H) receptors.HISTAMINEH3-Presynaptic  autoreceptorscAMPHistamine levels in brain, lungs, skin, gastric mucosaH2-Receptors cAMPGastric acid secretionH1-Receptors Ca2/H11001Smooth muscle contraction, increase in capillary permeabilitycAMPH4-ReceptorsChemotaxis, cytokine secretionHISTAMINE LIBERATORSMany agents release histamine from mast cells (Fig. 6.1).UsesHistamine has no valid clinical use.BETAHISTINEIt is a histamine analogue that is used orally to treat vertigo in Meniere’s disease. It prob-ably acts by improving blood ﬂow in the inner ear. The side effects are nausea, vomiting, headache and pruritus. It should be avoided in patients with asthma and peptic ulcer.

232PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES 2. They have antiallergic action; hence, most of the manifestations of type I reactions are suppressed. 3. They have anticholinergic actions – cause dryness of mouth, blurring of vision, constipation, urinary retention.PharmacokineticsH1-antihistamines are well absorbed after oral and parenteral administration. They are distributed widely throughout the body, metabolized extensively in liver and  excreted in urine.Adverse Effects 1 .  The common adverse effects are sedation, drowsiness, lack of concentration, headache, fatigue, weakness, lassitude, psychomotor incoordination, etc. Hence, H1-antihistamines should be avoided while driving or operating machinery. These adverse effects are rare with second-generation antihistamines. 2. Gastrointestinal side effects are nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and epigastric discomfort. 3. Anticholinergic side effects such as dryness of mouth, blurring of vision, constipa-tion and urinary retention. These effects are not seen with second-generation antihistamines. 4. T eratogenic effects of some H1-blockers have been observed in animals. 5. Allergic reactions may occur rarely with these agents, especially contact dermatitis on topical application.Uses 1. Allergic diseases: H1-antihistamines are used to prevent and treat symptoms of allergic reactions. For example, pruritus, urticaria, dermatitis, rhinitis, conjunc-tivitis and angioedema of lips respond to these drugs. 2. Common cold: They produce symptomatic relief by sedative and anticholinergic actions. 3. Preanaesthetic medication: Promethazine is used for its sedative and anticholin-ergic effects. 4. As antiemetic: Promethazine, diphenhydramine, dimenhydrinate, etc. are useful for prophylaxis of motion sickness because of their anticholinergic action. They act probably on the vestibular apparatus or cortex. Sedative effect also contributes to their beneﬁcial effect. These drugs are useful in drug-induced and postoperative vomiting. Promethazine, in combination with other antiemetics, is used to control vomiting due to cancer chemotherapy and radiation therapy.MotionVestibularapparatus(M, H1)CerebellumVomiting centre  (M, H1) 5. Parkinsonism: Imbalance between dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (gDA or hACh) in the basal ganglia produces parkinsonism. Promethazine, diphenhydr-amine or orphenadrine are used to control tremor, rigidity (central action) and sialorrhoea of parkinsonism due to their anticholinergic and sedative properties. Promethazine and diphenhydramine are useful for the treatment of idiopathic and drug-induced parkinsonism. 6. H1-blockers are used to control mild blood transfusion and saline infusion reac-tions (chills and rigors) and as adjunct in anaphylaxis.

2336—AUTACOIDS AND RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 7. Cinnarizine, dimenhydrinate and meclizine are effective for controlling vertigo in Meniere’s disease and other types of vertigo. Their antihistaminic and anticho-linergic actions are useful in this condition. 8. Sedative and hypnotic: H1-antihistamines (e.g. promethazine and diphenhydr-amine) are used to induce sleep, especially in children during minor surgical procedures.SECOND-GENERATION H1-BLOCKERS (Table 6.1)Cetirizine, levocetirizine, loratadine, desloratadine, azelastine, fexofenadine, etc. are highly selective for H1-receptors and have the following properties. They: 1. Have no anticholinergic effects. 2. Lack antiemetic effect. 3. Do not cross blood–brain barrier (BBB), hence cause minimal/no drowsiness. 4. Do not impair psychomotor performance. 5. Are relatively expensive.Cetirizine is one of the commonly used second-generation antihistamines. In addi-tion to H1-blocking effect, it can also inhibit the release of histamine. It causes minimal/or no drowsiness. It is not metabolized in the body. Incidence of cardiac arrhythmias is rare with this drug.DrugRoute and  duration of actionImportant featuresCetirizinep.o., 12–24 hours• H1-blocker; inhibits histamine release; achieves good concentration in the skin; poorly crosses BBB; may cause drowsiness• Drug interactions rareLevocetirizinep.o., 12–24 hoursMore potent and produces less adverse effects than cetirizineLoratadineDesloratadineMizolastineEbastinep.o., 24 hours• Long acting, nonsedating agents• Cardiac arrhythmias have been noticed in animals treated with ebastine• No cardiac arrhythmias with loratadine and desloratadine• Loratadine may rarely cause seizuresFexofenadinep.o., 12–24 hours• Active metabolite of terfenadine• Nonsedating agent• Arrhythmias rare; avoid in patients with prolonged QT intervalAzelastineTopical (nasal  spray, eye drops), 12–24 hours• H1-blocker; inhibits histamine release• Produces active metabolite• Has a rapid onset and long duration of action• Taste alteration, burning sensation in the nose, drowsinessRupatadinep.o.H1-blocker /H11001 blocks actions of platelet-activating factor}Table 6.1   Second-generation H1-blockers

234PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESUsesSecond-generation H1-blockers are used in various allergic disorders, e.g. rhinitis, dermatitis, conjunctivitis, urticaria, eczema, drug and food allergies. For allergic rhi-nitis or hay fever, fexofenadine, cetirizine, mizolastine or rupatadine are used orally. Azelastine is used as nasal spray in allergic rhinitis. For urticaria, atopic dermatitis and other skin allergies, fexofenadine, cetirizine, mizolastine, loratadine and ebastine are useful. Azelastine and levocabastine are available as eye drops for allergic  conjunctivitis.ANTIVERTIGO DRUGSVertigo is a sensation of rotation or movement of one’s self or of one’s surrounding in any plane. Antivertigo drugs are cinnarizine, promethazine and diphenhydramine (H1-blockers), hyoscine (anticholinergic), prochlorperazine (phenothiazine), betahistine (H1-analogue), acetazolamide, thiazides and furosemide (diuretics), diazepam (benzo-diazepine), amitriptyline (tricyclic antidepressant [TCA]), glucocorticoids, etc. Cinnari-zine is a ﬁrst-generation H1-blocker. It decreases entry of calcium into vestibular cells and relieves vertigo. Antihistaminics, anticholinergics and prochlorperazine act as laby-rinthine suppressants. Corticosteroids decrease oedema in the labyrinth.5-Hydroxytryptamine: Agonists and Antagonists  PH1.165-HT (serotonin) is an important neurotransmitter, widely distributed in plants and animals. It is synthesized from an amino acid, tryptophan. High concentration of 5-HT is found in the intestine, platelets and brain. 5-HT is involved in several conditions such as migraine, affective disorders, psychoses, GI disorders and sleep. There are seven subtypes of serotonin receptors (1–7). All of them are G-protein–coupled receptors, except 5-HT3 (ligand-gated ion channel). The serotonin receptor subtypes are shown in Table 6.2.5-HT ANTAGONISTSCyproheptadineI H1-receptor and 5-HT2A blockerI Has sedative, antipruritic and anticholinergic effectsI Increases appetiteI Useful in carcinoid and postgastrectomy dumping syndrome (to control GI manifestations)I Dry mouth, drowsiness, weight gain are some of the side effectsKetanserinI 5-HT2A antagonist and /H92511-blockerI Has antihypertensive effectOndansetron and GranisetronThey are 5-HT3 receptor antagonists used as antiemetics.Atypical AntipsychoticsClozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, etc. are 5-HT2 blockers used in schizophrenia.

taken on a long-term basis, e.g. paracetamol, aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac and mefenamic acid. They are useful in mild and moderate migraine.Antiemetics (Oral or Parenteral).  They are used to treat nausea and vomiting associ-ated with the attack. They also improve absorption of oral medications used to treat migraine, e.g. metoclopramide, domperidone, prochlorperazine, promethazine and diphenhydramine.Ergot PreparationsErgotamine.  Oral/sublingual/suppository preparation is used at the onset of pain or warning symptoms. It is used in moderate to severe migraine.Mechanism of Action.  It acts as a partial agonist at 5-HT1B/1D receptors in cranial blood vessels n constriction of dilated cranial blood vessels, decreases inﬂammation and extravasation of plasma into perivascular space.Ergotamine is available in combination with caffeine. Caffeine increases absorption of ergotamine. It also has vasoconstrictor effect on cranial blood vessels like ergotamine.Dihydroergotamine.  It is administered parenterally (i.m., i.v., s.c.) at the time of attack. It is safer for parenteral use than ergotamine.DrugAction  on receptorEffectsUse with routeAdverse  effectsErgotamine (natural  alkaloid)Partial agonist/ antagonist  at /H9251, 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptorsContraction of smooth muscles – blood vessels, uterus, gut and other visceraAcute  migraine (oral, sublin-gual, rectal)Vomiting,  diarrhoea;  overdosage – severe vaso-spasm n gan-greneDihydroergot-amine (semi-synthetic)• Predominant /H9251-blockade• Weak 5-HT and /H9251-agonistic action• Smooth muscle contraction less than  ergotamine• Less vasocon-strictor effect (safer than  ergotamine for parenteral use)Acute  migraine (oral, i.m., s.c.)Nausea,  vomiting

Selective 5-HT1B/1D agonists, include sumatriptan, rizatriptan, eletriptan, almotriptan, zolmitriptan, naratriptan, frovatriptan, etc. They are used in moderate and severe migraine.Mechanism of Action of Triptans (Selective 5-HT1B/1D Agonists)• Triptans• Decrease 5-HT and vasoactive peptide release by acting on 5-HT1B/1D receptors on  presynaptic nerve endings• Inhibit  extravasation of plasma proteins in the perivascular spaceSelective 5-HT1B/1D agonistsConstrict dilated cranial blood vessels and arteriovenous shuntsRestore cerebral blood flowAbnormal dilatationof cranial blood vesselsCerebral ischaemiaMigraine attack
By inhibiting the release of inﬂammatory peptides from the nerve endings in the  perivascular space, they decrease inﬂammation. They are the preferred drugs for acute attack of migraine. All triptans are administered orally. Sumatriptan can also be  administered by s.c. and nasal routes; zolmitriptan can also be given by nasal route. Sumatriptan is rapid acting and has a half-life of 2 hours. Other triptans have a higher oral bioavailability than sumatriptan. Frovatriptan and naratriptan have longer  half-life than sumatriptan.Adverse Effects and Contraindications of Triptans.  They include paraesthesia, tightness in the chest, ﬂushing and dizziness. Nausea may occur. Pain at the site of injection is com-mon. They may cause a rise in BP and coronary vasospasm. Triptans are contraindicated in pregnancy, patients  with ischaemic heart disease, and those with peripheral vascular disease, hypertension and risk factor for coronary artery disease. Triptan and ergot preparations should not be coadministered; neither should triptans be taken within  24 hours of an ergot derivative.Prophylaxis of Migraine (Note ABCD)Prophylactic treatment may be required if migraine headaches occur two/three or more times in a month or if there is signiﬁcant functional impairment during the attack. The drugs used are as follows: 1. Beta-blockers: Propranolol, timolol, atenolol, metoprolol, etc. Propranolol is more effective than other /H9252-blockers; requires prolonged treatment. The mechanism of action is unknown. 2. Antidepressants: TCAs like amitriptyline help to reduce attacks of migraine; exact mechanism of action of antimigraine effect is not clear. TCAs produce undesirable side effects on prolonged therapy. 3. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs): For example, verapamil and ﬂunarizine. They reduce the frequency of attacks. Flunarizine is selective for cerebral calcium chan-nels; it also has Na/H11001 channel–blocking effect. CCBs should not be co-administered with /H9252-blockers. 4. Anticonvulsants: For example, gabapentin, sodium valproate and topiramate are used for migraine prophylaxis.Others: Methysergide and cyproheptadine are rarely used for prophylaxis of  migraine.

238PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESProstaglandins and Leukotrienes (Eicosanoids)  PH1.16PROSTAGLANDINSPGs are the products of long-chain fatty acids. Arachidonic acid is the precursor for bio-synthesis of all PGs. The enzyme involved in the formation of PGs from arachidonic acid is cyclooxygenase (COX). The main PGs are PGE2, PGF2/H9251 a n d  P G I2. Another class of substances obtained from arachidonic acid by the action of lipoxygenase is leukotrienes.There are two forms of COX, called COX-1 and COX-2 (Fig. 6.2). COX-1 is constitu-tive (it is always present) and is widely distributed. It participates in various physiologi-cal functions such as protection of gastric mucosa, homeostasis and regulation of cell division. COX-2 is induced during inﬂammation by cytokines and endotoxins.Pharmacological Actions and Uses (Fig. 6.3) 1. GI tract: PGE2 and PGI2 reduce acid secretion and increase the secretion of mucus in the stomach (cytoprotective action). Misoprostol (PGE1 analogue) is used for the prevention of NSAID-induced ulcers (Table 6.4). 2. Cardiovascular system: PGD2, PGE2 and PGI2 cause vasodilatation. PGF2/H9251 constricts pulmonary veins and arteries. TXA2 is a vasoconstrictor. (a) PGE1 (alprostadil) is used to maintain the patency of ductus arteriosus before surgery.

Other PGI2 analogues useful in this condition are treprostinil and iloprost. 3. Platelets: PGI2 inhibits platelet aggregation. Hence, it is useful during haemodi-alysis to prevent platelet aggregation. 4. Eye: PGF2/H9251 has been found to decrease intraocular tension. Its analogues, e.g. latanoprost, bimatoprost, travoprost and unoprostone, are used in glaucoma. 5. Uterus: (a) PGE2 (low concentration) and PGF2/H9251 contract pregnant uterus; PGs are mainly used in mid-trimester abortion, missed abortion and in hydatidiform mole (Table 6.4). (b) Induction of labour: PGE2 and PGF2/H9251 can induce labour at term. (c) Cervical priming: PGE2, PGE1 and PGF2/H9251 promote ripening of the cervix; make the cervix favourable for induction and facilitation of labour. (d) Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH): PGs increase tone as well as amplitude of uter-ine contractions. Carboprost (15-methyl PGF2/H9251) can be used to control PPH. 6. Male reproductive system: PGE1 (alprostadil) is useful in the treatment of erectile dysfunction.Therapeutic Uses of Prostaglandins in Obstetrics 1. Abortion: PGs stimulate uterine contractions and cause ripening of the cervix.I Dinoprostone (vaginal) is used for induction of mid-trimester abortion, missed abortion and hydatidiform mole.I Misoprostol (oral or vaginal) can be used in combination with mifepristone or methotrexate to induce abortion in early pregnancy.I Carboprost (i.m.) is used to induce abortion in second trimester of pregnancy.I Gemeprost (PGE1) and dinoprost (PGF2/H9251) are also useful for inducing abortion. 2. Induction of labour: PGs can be used to soften the cervix for induction of labour. PGE2 can facilitate labour by softening and dilatation of cervix. 3. PPH: Carboprost (i.m.) and misoprostol (oral) can be used to control PPH.Adverse EffectsThey are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, ﬂushing, hypotension and backache due to uterine contractions. Injections are painful due to sensitization of nerve endings.LEUKOTRIENESThese are obtained from arachidonic acid by the action of lipoxygenase.Leukotriene Antagonists (See p. 259)Nonsteroidal Anti-Inﬂammatory Drugs  PH1.16CLASSIFICATION 1. Nonselective COX inhibitors (a) Salicylates: Aspirin, diﬂunisal. (b) Propionic acid derivatives: Ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, ﬂurbiprofen. (c) Fenamic acid derivatives: Mefenamic acid, ﬂufenamic acid. (d) Acetic acid derivatives: Ketorolac, indomethacin. (e) Enolic acid derivatives: Piroxicam, tenoxicam, lornoxicam.

2416—AUTACOIDS AND RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 2. Preferential COX-2 inhibitors: Diclofenac, aceclofenac, nimesulide, meloxicam. 3. Highly selective COX-2 inhibitors: Etoricoxib, parecoxib. 4. Analgesic and antipyretics having weak anti-inﬂammatory effect: Paracetamol, nefopam.MECHANISM OF ACTIONCOX is the enzyme responsible for biosynthesis of various PGs. There are two well-recognized isoforms of COX: COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is constitutive, found in most tissues such as blood vessels, stomach and kidney. PGs have important physiological role in many tissues (Fig. 6.2). COX-2 is induced during inﬂammation by cytokines and endotoxins and is responsible for the production of prostanoid mediators of  inﬂammation.Aspirin and most of the NSAIDs inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms; thereby decrease PGs and thromboxane synthesis. The anti-inﬂammatory effect of NSAIDs  is mainly due to inhibition of COX-2. Aspirin causes irreversible inhibition of COX activity. Rest of the NSAIDs causes reversible inhibition of the enzyme.PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIONS OF ASPIRIN AND OTHER NSAIDsAspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is the prototype drug. The other nonselective NSAIDs vary mainly in their potency, analgesic, anti-inﬂammatory effects and duration of action. 1 .  Analgesic effect: N S A I D s  a r e  m a i n l y  u s e d  f o r  r e l i e v i n g  m u s c u l o s k e l e t a l  p a i n ,  dysmenorrhoea and pain associated with inﬂammation or tissue damage. Anal-gesic effect is mainly due to peripheral inhibition of PG production. They pre-vent sensitization of peripheral nerve endings by inﬂammatory mediators. They also increase pain threshold by acting at subcortical site. These drugs relieve pain without causing sedation, respiratory depression, tolerance or dependence. They are less efﬁcacious than opioids as analgesics. Aspirin produces analgesia at doses of 2–3 g/day. 2. Antipyretic effect: The thermoregulatory centre is situated in the hypothalamus. Fever occurs when there is a disturbance in hypothalamic thermostat. NSAIDs reset the hypothalamic thermostat and reduce the elevated body temperature  during fever. They promote heat loss by causing cutaneous vasodilatation and sweating. They do not affect normal body temperature. The antipyretic effect is mainly due to inhibition of PGs in the hypothalamus. The dose of aspirin for antipyretic effect is 2–3 g/day. 3. Anti-inﬂammatory effect: Anti-inﬂammatory effect is seen at high doses (aspirin: 4–6 g/day in divided doses). These drugs produce only symptomatic relief. They suppress signs and symptoms of inﬂammation such as pain, tenderness, swelling, vasodilatation and leukocyte inﬁltration but they do not affect the progression of underlying disease.The anti-inﬂammatory action of NSAIDs is mainly due to inhibition of PG synthesis at the site of injury. They also affect other mediators of inﬂamma-tion (bradykinin, histamine, serotonin, etc.), thus inhibit granulocyte adher-ence to the damaged vasculature. NSAIDs also cause modulation of T-cell function, stabilization of lysosomal membrane and inhibition of chemotaxis. 4 .  Antiplatelet (antithrombotic) effect: Aspirin in low doses (50–325 mg/day) ir-reversibly inhibits platelet TXA2 s y n t h e s i s  a n d  p r o d u c e s  a n t i p l a t e l e t  e f f e c t ,  which lasts for 8–10 days, i.e. the life time of the platelets. Aspirin in high doses 

242PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES(2–3 g/day) inhibits both PGI2 and TXA2 synthesis, hence antiplatelet effect is lost. Aspirin should be withdrawn 1 week prior to elective surgery because of the risk of bleeding.Aspirin(2–3 g/day)PGI2  (PGI2 causes vasodilatation    and inhibits platelet aggregation)TXA2  (TXA2 causes vasoconstriction and   promotes platelet aggregation)Low-dose aspirin(50–325 mg) 5. Acid–base and electrolyte balance: In therapeutic doses, salicylates cause respira-tory alkalosis, which is compensated by excretion of bicarbonate (compensated respiratory alkalosis). In toxic doses, the respiratory centre is depressed and can lead to respiratory acidosis. Later, there is uncompensated metabolic acidosis. 6. GIT: Aspirin irritates the gastric mucosa and produces nausea, vomiting and dys-pepsia. The salicylic acid formed from aspirin also contributes to these effects. Aspirin also stimulates CTZ and produces vomiting (Fig. 6.4).AspirinInhibits PGs in the gastric mucosaIncrease inHCl productionGastric irritation, peptic ulcerAcidicpH of stomachAspirinExists in unionized formEnters themucosal cellpH 7.1• Acute ulcers• Erosive gastritis• HaemorrhageLoss ofprotective actionIonized andbecomes indiffusible(within the mucosal cells) 7. CVS: Prolonged use of aspirin and other NSAIDs causes sodium and water reten-tion. They may precipitate CCF in patients with low cardiac reserve. They may also decrease the effect of antihypertensive drugs. 8. Urate excretion: Salicylates, in therapeutic doses, inhibit urate secretion into the renal tubules and increase the plasma urate levels. In high doses, salicylates inhibit the reabsorption of uric acid in the renal tubules and produce uricosuric effect.PHARMACOKINETICSSalicylates are rapidly absorbed from the upper GI tract. They are highly bound to plasma proteins but the binding is saturable. Salicylates are well distributed throughout 

2436—AUTACOIDS AND RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
the tissues and body ﬂuids; metabolized in liver by glycine and glucuronide conjugation. In low doses, elimination follows ﬁrst-order kinetics and with high doses as the me-tabolizing enzymes get saturated, it switches over to zero-order kinetics. After this, an increase in salicylate dosage increases its plasma concentration markedly and severe toxicity can occur. Alkalinization of urine increases the rate of excretion of salicylates.DOSAGE REGIMEN FOR ASPIRINAnalgesic dose: 2–3 g/day in divided doses after food.Anti-inﬂammatory dose: 4–6 g/day in divided doses after food.Antiplatelet dose: 50–325 mg/day (low-dose aspirin).ADVERSE EFFECTS 1. GIT: Nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, epigastric pain, acute gastritis, ulceration and GI bleeding. Ulcerogenic effect is the major drawback of NSAIDs, which is prevented/minimized by taking: (a) NSAIDs after food. (b) Buffered aspirin (preparation of aspirin with antacid). (c) Proton-pump inhibitors/H2-blockers/misoprostol with NSAIDs. (d) Selective COX-2 inhibitors. 2. Hypersensitivity: It is relatively more common with aspirin. The manifestations are skin rashes, urticaria, rhinitis, bronchospasm, angioneurotic oedema and rarely anaphylactoid reaction.Bronchospasm (aspirin-induced asthma) is due to increased production of leukotrienes. Incidence of hypersensitivity is high in patients with asthma, nasal polyps, recurrent rhinitis or urticaria. Therefore, aspirin should be avoided in such patients. 3. In people with G6PD deﬁciency, administration of salicylates may cause haemo-lytic anaemia. 4. Prolonged use of salicylates interfere with action of vitamin K in the liver n decreased synthesis of clotting factors (hypoprothrombinaemia) n predisposes to bleeding (can be treated by administration of vitamin K). 5. Reye’s syndrome: Use of salicylates in children with viral infection may cause hepatic damage with fatty inﬁltration and encephalopathy – Reye’s syndrome. Hence, salicylates are contraindicated in children with viral infection. 6. Pregnancy: These drugs inhibit PG synthesis, thereby delay onset of labour and increase chances of PPH. In the newborn, inhibition of PG synthesis results in premature closure of ductus arteriosus.Fig. 6.4 Action of aspirin on stomach and CTZ. /H17053, Stimulation; /H17054, inhibition; PGs, prosta-glandins.PGs↑HClAspirinSalicylic acidCTZ

244PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES 7. Analgesic nephropathy: Slowly progressive renal failure may occur on chronic use of high doses of NSAIDs. Renal failure is usually reversible on stoppage of therapy but rarely NSAIDs may cause irreversible renal damage.SalicylismSalicylate intoxication may be mild or severe. The mild form is called salicylism. The symptoms include headache, tinnitus, vertigo, confusion, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, sweating, hyperpnoea, electrolyte imbalance, etc. These symptoms are reversible on stoppage of therapy.Acute Salicylate PoisoningIt is common in children. Manifestations are vomiting, dehydration, acid–base and  electrolyte imbalances, hyperpnoea, restlessness, confusion, coma, convulsions, cardio-vascular collapse, pulmonary oedema, hyperpyrexia and death.Treat ment.  There is no speciﬁc antidote for salicylate poisoning. Treatment is symptomatic. 1. Hospitalization. 2. Gastric lavage followed by administration of activated charcoal (activated charcoal adsorbs the toxic material – physical antagonism). 3. Maintain ﬂuid and electrolyte balance. Correct acid–base disturbances. 4. Intravenous sodium bicarbonate to treat metabolic acidosis. It also alkalinizes the urine and enhances renal excretion of salicylates (since salicylates exist in ionized form in alkaline pH). 5. External cooling. 6. Haemodialysis in severe cases. 7. Vitamin K1 and blood transfusion if there is bleeding.DRUG INTERACTIONS 1. NSAIDs /H11003 glucocorticoids: Potentiation of GI complications – nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, epigastric pain, acute gastritis, ulceration and GI bleeding. 2. NSAIDs potentiate the effects of oral anticoagulants, oral hypoglycaemic agents (sulphonylureas) and methotrexate by displacing them from plasma protein bind-ing sites. 3. Some of the NSAIDs (e.g. piroxicam) can impair the clearance of lithium leading to its toxicity. 4. NSAIDs /H11003 thiazides/furosemide: NSAIDs by inhibiting PG synthesis promote Na/H11001 and water retention on chronic use. Thus, they decrease the diuretic efﬁcacy of thiazides/furosemide. 5 .  NSAIDs /H11003 antihypertensives: NSAIDs by inhibiting PG synthesis promote Na/H11001 and water retention on chronic use. Thus, they decrease the efﬁcacy of antihypertensives.CLINICAL USES OF NSAIDs (FOR BASIS AND EXPLANATION, SEE ‘PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIONS’) 1. As analgesic: In painful conditions like headache, toothache, backache, body ache, muscle pain, joint pain, bursitis, neuralgias and dysmenorrhoea. 2. As antipyretic: T o reduce elevated body temperature in fever, paracetamol is pre-ferred because: (a) Gastrointestinal symptoms are rare. (b) It does not cause Reye syndrome in children.

2456—AUTACOIDS AND RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 3. Osteoarthritis: In mild cases, paracetamol is used. In severe cases of osteoarthri-tis, other NSAIDs are more effective than paracetamol. T opical agents like methyl salicylate, diclofenac gel and capsaicin cream can also be used. 4. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA): NSAIDs have anti-inﬂammatory effects and can pro-duce only symptomatic relief but they do not alter the progression of disease. 5. Acute rheumatic fever: Aspirin is the preferred drug. It reduces fever, relieves swelling and joint pain, but does not affect the normal course of the disease. 6. Thromboembolic disorders: The antiplatelet effect of low-dose aspirin is made use of in the prophylactic treatment of various thromboembolic disorders, such as (a) Transient ischaemic attacks (b) Myocardial infarction (MI) (i) To reduce incidence of recurrent MI (ii) To decrease mortality in post-MI patients 7. Other uses: (a) Medical closure of patent ductus arteriosus (indomethacin is preferred). (b) Colon and rectal cancer: Regular use of aspirin is reported to reduce the risk of cancer. (c) Aspirin is reported to reduce the risk and retard the onset of Alzheimer’s disease. (d) To control radiation-induced diarrhoea. (e) To control pruritus and ﬂushing associated with the use of nicotinic acid. (f) Low dose of aspirin may be useful in preeclampsia.Aspirin per se is rarely used at present because of the following disadvantages: 1. It has a short duration of action, requires large doses and frequent administration. 2. Gastric irritation and ulcerogenic effect are the main drawbacks of NSAIDs. The incidence is high with aspirin. 3. Salicylates should be avoided in children with viral infection. 4 .  NSAIDs may precipitate bronchospasm in patients with bronchial asthma (aspirin-induced asthma).OTHER NSAIDs (Table 6.5)They have similar mechanism of action, pharmacological actions, therapeutic uses and adverse effects. They vary mainly in their potency, duration of action, analgesic and anti-inﬂammatory effects.NimesulideI Preferential COX-2 inhibitorI Has analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inﬂammatory effectsI Used in dysmenorrhoea, osteoarthritis, skin, soft tissue and bone inﬂammatory conditions, etc.DrugRoute and  formulations with oral doseOther points 1.

Uses 1. As antipyretic: T o reduce body temperature during fever. 2. As analgesic: T o relieve headache, toothache, myalgia, dysmenorrhoea, etc. 3. It is the preferred analgesic and antipyretic in patients with peptic ulcer, haemo-philia, bronchial asthma and children.Adverse Effects 1. Side effects are rare, occasionally causes skin rashes and nausea. 2. Hepatotoxicity: With acute overdose or chronic use. 3. Nephrotoxicity is commonly seen on chronic use.Acute Paracetamol Poisoning.  Acute overdosage mainly causes hepatotoxicity – the symp-toms are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, hypoglycaemia, hypotension, hypoprothrombinaemia, coma, etc. Death is usually due to hepatic necrosis.Mechanism of Toxicity and Its Treatment (Fig. 6.5)I The toxic metabolite of paracetamol is detoxiﬁed by conjugation with glutathione and gets eliminated.I High doses of paracetamol cause depletion of glutathione levels. In the absence of glutathione, toxic metabolite (N-acetyl-p-benzo-quinoneimine [NAPQI]) binds covalently with proteins in the liver and kidney and causes necrosis.I Alcoholics and premature infants are more prone to hepatotoxicity.I N-acetylcysteine or oral methionine replenishes the glutathione stores of the liver and protects liver cells.I Activated charcoal is administered to decrease the absorption of paracetamol from the gut.I Haemodialysis may be required in cases with acute renal failure.TOPICAL NSAIDsT opical formulations of NSAIDs are available. Systemic toxicity is minimal. Diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, etc. are useful topically for musculoskeletal pain. They are used in backache, osteoarthritis, sprain, etc. Flurbiprofen and diclofenac eye drops are used in ophthalmic practice.AspirinParacetamol (acetaminophen) 1. It is a salicylate derivative 2.

2496—AUTACOIDS AND RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
Drugs Used in the Treatment of Gout  PH1.16Gout is a disorder of purine metabolism in which plasma urate concentration is raised either due to overproduction or impaired excretion of uric acid. It is characterized by intermittent attacks of acute arthritis produced by deposition of sodium urate crystals in joints.Primary hyperuricaemia may be idiopathic or due to enzyme defects. Secondary hyperuricaemia can occur in leukaemias, chronic renal failure and during drug therapy (thiazides, loop diuretics, pyrazinamide, levodopa, cytotoxic agents, etc.).CLASSIFICATION 1. Acute gout (a) NSAIDs: Indomethacin, naproxen, diclofenac, aceclofenac, piroxicam, sulindac, etoricoxib (b) Colchicine (c) Glucocorticoids: Prednisolone, methylprednisolone, triamcinolone 2. Long-term control of gout or hyperuricaemia (a) Uricosuric agents: Probenecid, sulphinpyrazone (b) Uric acid synthesis inhibitors: Allopurinol, febuxostatTREATMENT OF ACUTE ATTACK OF GOUTNonsteroidal Anti-Inﬂammatory DrugsT o relieve an acute attack, NSAIDs like naproxen, indomethacin, piroxicam, diclofenac, aceclofenac and etoricoxib are used. They are better tolerated than colchicine.Fig. 6.5 Mechanism of paracetamol toxicity and its treatment.

250PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESColchicine.  It is an alkaloid. It is neither an analgesic nor a uricosuric agent, although it relieves pain in acute attack of gout. Deposition of urate crystals in the joint n chemotactic factors produced n migration of neutrophils into the joint n release factors which contribute to inﬂammation. Colchicine prevents release of chemotactic factors and inhibits migration of neutrophils to the affected area. It is administered  either orally or intravenously. It is rapid acting but poorly tolerated. They are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Chronic use may lead to myopathy, alopecia, aplastic anaemia and agranulocytosis.Glucocorticoids.  Glucocorticoids are effective, produce rapid response and are reserved for cases not responding to NSAIDs and colchicine. Prednisolone and methylpredniso-lone are used systemically in gout. If a single joint is affected, then intra-articular triam-cinolone is effective.TREATMENT OF CHRONIC GOUTUricosuric AgentsThey inhibit active tubular reabsorption of uric acid in proximal tubules and increase excretion of uric acid, e.g. probenecid and sulphinpyrazone. They are rapid acting but poorly tolerated. High ﬂuid intake is advised to prevent formation of urate crystals  in urine. Sulphinpyrazone is an alternative to probenecid. Uricosuric drugs should  not be given within 3 weeks of an acute attack of gout. They mobilize uric acid  from tophaceous deposits, hence there is ﬂuctuation in serum uric acid levels which  can precipitate an acute attack. These drugs are contraindicated in patients with renal failure. Side effects are rare, but GI toxicity (nausea, vomiting) and skin rashes may  occur.DRUG INTERACTIONSProbenecid /H11003 /H9252-Lactam Antibiotics (Penicillins, Cephalosporins)They are excreted by active tubular secretion. When they are administered simultane-ously, probenecid competes with penicillins/cephalosporins and blocks the tubular  secretion of /H9252-lactam antibiotics. Therefore, plasma levels of /H9252-lactam antibiotics and their duration of action increases. Thus, the treatment becomes more effective.Uric Acid Synthesis InhibitorsXanthineHypoxanthineXanthine oxidaseXanthine oxidaseUric acidAllopurinol.  Allopurinol prevents the synthesis of uric acid by inhibiting the enzyme xanthine oxidase, thus reduces the plasma urate levels. Its active metabolite, alloxan-thine, is a noncompetitive inhibitor of xanthine oxidase enzyme. It reduces urate crys-tals in the kidney, joints and soft tissue. There is an increase in the levels of xanthine and hypoxanthine in plasma which are effectively excreted in urine.Allopurinol is administered orally and is the drug of choice for asymptomatic gout. It is used in chronic gout as well as hyperuricaemia associated with cancer che-motherapy, radiation or renal disease. It should not be started within 3 weeks of an acute attack of gout, as it may precipitate another attack. Allopurinol is also useful in kala-azar.

2516—AUTACOIDS AND RESPIRATORY SYSTEMAdverse Effects 1. Hypersensitivity: Skin rashes, itching, erythema, headache, fever and rarely Stevens–Johnson syndrome may occur. 2. GIT: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and occasionally hepatotoxicity may also occur.Allopurinol is contraindicated in children, pregnancy, lactation, patients with liver and kidney diseases.Drug InteractionsAllopurinol /H11003 6-mercaptopurine6-Mercaptopurine  Thiouric acidAllopurinolXanthine oxidaseAllopurinol interferes with the metabolism of 6-mercaptopurine by inhibiting the  enzyme xanthine oxidase and increases its effect. Therefore, allopurinol is commonly used in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy to reduce hyperuricaemia, decrease the dose of 6-mercaptopurine and its side effects.Febuxostat.  It is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor n decreases formation of uric acid. It is administered orally (once daily dose is used) for chronic gout. Adverse effects include diarrhoea, headache and hepatotoxicity. Febuxostat can be used in gout in patients  intolerant to allopurinol.Rasburicase.  It is a urate oxidase produced by recombinant technology. It converts uric acid to soluble allantoin.Uric acidAllantoin(soluble)Excreted in urineRasburicase/H11001It is infused to decrease serum uric acid levels in children with leukaemia on anticancer drug therapy. Haemolysis, gastrointestinal disturbances, hypersensitivity reactions may occur.Pegloticase.  It converts uric acid to allantoin which is soluble and easily excreted in urine. It is administered as i.v. infusion in cases not responding to other drugs. Anaphylaxis can occur.Drugs Used in the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis  PH1.16Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic multisystem autoimmune disease of unknown cause. Although there are a variety of systemic manifestations, the main characteristic feature is persistent inﬂammatory synovitis of peripheral smaller joints. The course of the disease is prolonged with exacerbation and remissions. Pain and swelling of the 

252PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESjoints are mainly due to PGs, whereas cytokines are responsible for progressive damage to the joints leading to deformity.Drugs used in the treatment of RA: 1. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (i) NonbiologicsMethotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, chloroquine, hy-droxychloroquine, sulphasalazine, leﬂunomide, gold salts, d-penicillamine. (ii) Biologics (a) TNF-/H9251 antagonists: Etanercept, inﬂiximab, adalimumab (b) IL-1 antagonist: Anakinra (c) T-cell modulating agent: Abatacept (d) B-lymphocyte depleter: Rituximab 2. NSAIDs: Aspirin, ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, piroxicam, etoricoxib. 3. Glucocorticoids: Prednisolone, triamcinolone, methylprednisolone.M – MethotrexateE – EtanerceptD – D-PenicillamineI – InﬂiximabC – Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquineA – Anakinra, abataceptL – LeﬂunomideS – SulphasalazineR – RituximabGold compoundsNONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGSRapidly produce symptomatic relief – they reduce inﬂammation, pain, stiffness and swelling but they have little effect on the progression of bone and cartilage destruction.DISEASE-MODIFYING ANTIRHEUMATIC DRUGSNonbiologicsThey relieve symptoms as well as reduce disease activity in RA. The effects of DMARDs may take few weeks to several months to become evident. Once a diagnosis of RA is made, the patient should be started on a DMARD.MethotrexateIt is the preferred DMARD in the treatment of RA. It has relatively more rapid onset  of action than other DMARDs. It is a folate antagonist. The dose of methotrexate used in RA is much lower than the dose needed in cancer chemotherapy. It exerts anti- inﬂammatory effect. It inhibits chemotaxis of neutrophils and decreases production  of proinﬂammatory cytokines by activated T cells. Methotrexate is administered orally starting with a dose of 7.5–15 mg once weekly and increasing the dose by 2.5 mg weekly if there is no improvement. It can also be used in psoriasis, polymyositis, giant cell arte-ritis, dermatomyositis, etc.Adverse Effects.  They include nausea, vomiting, mucosal ulcers and dose-dependant hepatotoxicity. Hence, hepatic function should be monitored periodically. The adverse effects can be minimized by administration of folic acid or folinic acid. Methotrexate is contraindicated in pregnancy, liver disease and peptic ulcer.Chloroquine and HydroxychloroquineThese are antimalarial drugs – also useful in RA. The exact mechanism of action of  these drugs in RA is not clear. They decrease release of lysosomal enzymes and scavenge Note: Mnemonic for DMARDs – M E D I C A L S R Gold (E, I, A and R are biologics).

2536—AUTACOIDS AND RESPIRATORY SYSTEMfree radicals. They are well tolerated. They are administered orally, highly bound to  tissue proteins and deposited in melanin containing tissues, especially eye. Prolonged administration may cause corneal opacity and retinal damage. Hence, ophthalmologic examination should be done at least once a year in patients on chloroquine/ hydroxychloroquine. The other side effects are nausea, vomiting and skin rashes. The drug is relatively safe in pregnancy. They are used alone in patients with mild disease  or in combination with methotrexate and/or sulphasalazine.SulphasalazineIt is used alone in mild disease or in combination with other drugs in severe cases.  It causes remission in active RA and is also used for chronic inﬂammatory  bowel disease. It is administered orally and is split in the gut by colonic bacteria. Common side effects are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, skin rashes and leukopaenia.

It inhibits T-cell proliferation. Leﬂunomide is used alone or in combination with methotrexate for the treatment of RA. It is as effective as metho-trexate. It is completely absorbed after oral administration and has a long plasma half-life of about 2–3 weeks. Hence, a loading dose is given. Adverse effects include loose stools (diarrhoea), loss of hair, liver toxicity (hepatotoxicity), leukopaenia and skin rashes. It is contraindicated in children, in pregnant women and lactating mothers. (Note ‘L’s.)Gold CompoundsThey are not used because of their toxicity.D-PenicillamineIt is a metabolite of penicillin and rarely used now because of toxicity.Adverse effects are proteinuria, pruritus, pancytopaenia, pemphigus-like skin rashes, thrombocytopaenia and GI side effects.

BiologicsBiologics are preparations made from microorganisms, animals or human or their products. They are administered parenterally. These agents are used in case of RA not responding to nonbiological agents. They are also useful in other autoimmune disorders like psoriasis, Crohn disease, ankylosing spondylitis and scleroderma (Table 6.8).Prolonged use may produce opportunistic infections like tuberculosis, P. jiroveci infection and urinary tract infection.GLUCOCORTICOIDSThese are adjuvant drugs in RA. Their effects are prompt and they suppress  inﬂammation quickly. They are administered either systemically or topically (intra-articular). Glucocorticoids are also used for certain serious extra-articular manifesta-tions or during periods of exacerbation. Prolonged use of glucocorticoids leads to adverse effects.Respiratory System  PH1.33DRUGS USED IN THE TREATMENT OF COUGHCough is a protective reﬂex, intended to remove irritants and accumulated secretions from the respiratory passages. The drugs used in the symptomatic treatment of cough are as follows: 1. Antitussives: Codeine, pholcodine, noscapine, dextromethorphan, prenoxdia-zine, chlophedianol and antihistamines. 2.

Mucolytics: Bromhexine, acetylcysteine, carbocisteine, ambroxol.Cough may be: 1. Productive cough: Helps to clear the airway. Suppression of productive cough is harmful as it may lead to infections. Treatment includes antibiotics for infection, expectorants and mucolytics for cough. 2. Nonproductive cough: It should be suppressed.AntitussivesThey inhibit cough reﬂex by suppressing the cough centre in medulla. They are used  for symptomatic treatment of dry, unproductive cough. Antitussives should be avoided in children younger than 1 year. 1. Codeine: (a) Has cough centre suppressant effect. (b) Causes mild CNS depression, hence drowsiness can occur. (c) Causes constipation by decreasing intestinal movements. (d) Should be avoided in children and asthmatics.Codeine is administered orally, has mild analgesic effect and less addiction liability than morphine. 2. Pholcodine: Antitussive action is similar to codeine. It has no analgesic or addic-tion liability. It is administered orally and has a long duration of action. 3. Noscapine: It is an opium alkaloid and has potent antitussive effect. It is useful in spasmodic cough. It has no analgesic effect, does not cause constipation, addiction or CNS depression. The side effects are nausea and headache; bronchospasm can occur in asthmatics. 4. Dextromethorphan: It is a centrally acting antitussive agent. It has no analgesic property, does not cause constipation and addiction; mucociliary function in  respiratory passages is not affected. It may cause sedation and hallucinations. 5 . Antihistamines: Diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, promethazine, etc. are useful in cough due to their sedative, antiallergic and anticholinergic actions. They produce symp-tomatic relief in cold and cough associated with allergic conditions of respiratory tract. 6. Prenoxdiazine: It acts peripherally on stretch receptors on the airways.Pharyngeal DemulcentsSyrups, lozenges, linctuses or liquorice may be used when cough arises due to irritation above the larynx. They increase salivation and produce protective soothing effect on the inﬂamed mucosa.Syrup is a concentrated solution of sugar containing the drug to mask the bitter taste of the drug.Lozenge, solid dosage form placed in the mouth and sucked; it dissolves slowly to liberate the active ingredient. It soothes the irritated mucosa of the throat, e.g. dyclonine (local anaesthetic) lozenge for sore throat.Linctus, viscous liquid sipped slowly to allow it trickle down the throat; used for relief of cough, e.g. linctus codeine.Expectorants (Mucokinetics)They increase the volume of bronchial secretion and decrease viscosity of the sputum; hence, cough becomes less tiring and productive. They include iodides, chlorides, bicar-bonates, acetates, volatile oils, etc.

It may cause gastric irritation, hence should be avoided in patients with peptic ulcer.Drugs Used in the Treatment of Bronchial Asthma  PH1.32In bronchial asthma, there is impairment of airﬂow due to contraction of bronchial smooth muscle (bronchospasm), swelling of bronchial mucosa (mucosal oedema) and increased bronchial mucus secretion. There is inﬂammation and hyperresponsiveness of airways.Several factors may precipitate attacks of asthma in susceptible individuals. They include allergy, infection and psychological factors. The airway obstruction in asthma is mainly due to the release of mediators from sensitized mast cells in the lungs. They are histamine, 5-HT (serotonin), PGs, leukotrienes (LTC4 and LTD4), proteases, PAF, etc. Bronchial asthma may be either episodic or chronic.Acute Asthma.  It is characterized by episodes of dyspnoea associated with expiratory wheezing.Chronic Asthma.  There is continuous wheeze and breathlessness on exertion; cough and mucoid sputum with recurrent respiratory infection are common.Status Asthmaticus (Acute Severe Asthma).  When an attack of asthma is prolonged with severe intractable wheezing, it is known as acute severe asthma.CLASSIFICATION OF ANTIASTHMATIC DRUGS 1. Bronchodilators (a) SympathomimeticsSelective /H92522-adrenergic agonists: Salbutamol and terbutaline (short acting); bambuterol, salmeterol and formoterol (long acting). (b) Methylxanthines: Theophylline, aminophylline, etophylline, doxophylline. (c) Anticholinergics: Ipratropium bromide, tiotropium bromide. 2. Leukotriene receptor antagonists: Zaﬁrlukast, montelukast, zileuton. 3. Mast cell stabilizers: Sodium cromoglycate, ketotifen.

Adrenaline (Nonselective Sympathomimetic).  It produces prompt and powerful bronchodi-latation by acting through /H92522-adrenergic receptors. It is useful in acute attack of asthma (not responding to other drugs) – 0.2–0.5 mL of 1:1000 solution given subcutaneously. Its use has declined because of its dangerous cardiac side effects.Selective /H92522-Adrenergic Agonists (Table 6.9).  They are the ﬁrst-line drugs for bronchial asthma. For mechanism of action – see ﬂowchart given above.They are well tolerated when inhaled.

258PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESMethylxanthines.  Use of methylxanthines in asthma has markedly diminished because of their narrow margin of safety and availability of better antiasthmatic drugs (selective /H92522-agonists, inhaled steroids and leukotriene antagonists).Mechanism of Action of Methylxanthines• Bronchodilatation • Inhibit the release of histamine and SRS-A from mast cells• Improve mucociliary clearance in respiratory passages• Theophylline• AminophyllineInhibitphosphodiesterase(PDE)↑cAMPMethylxanthines inhibit phosphodiesterases (PDEs), thereby prevent degradation of cAMP and cGMP . This results in accumulation of intracellular cAMP and in some tissues, cGMP . Methylxanthines are competitive antagonists at adenosine receptors, which also results in bronchodilatation.Pharmacokinetics.  Methylxanthines are well absorbed after oral and parenteral administration; food delays the rate of absorption of theophylline. They are well distrib-uted all over the body; they cross placental and blood–brain barrier. They get metabo-lized in liver and excreted in urine. 1. Theophylline: It is poorly water soluble, hence not suitable for injection. It is available for oral administration. 2. Aminophylline: It is water soluble but highly irritant. It can be administered orally or slow intravenously. 3. Etophylline: It is water soluble and can be given by oral, i.m. or i.v. routes. 4. DoxophyllineI Methylxanthine derivativeI Orally administered – once or twice daily dose is usedI Less likely to cause GI and CNS side effectsAdverse Effects.  They have a narrow margin of safety. They can cause tachycardia, pal-pitation, hypotension and sometimes sudden death due to cardiac arrhythmias (Fig. 6.6).

Phenytoin/rifampicin/phenobarbitone /H11003 theophylline: They are enzyme induc-ers; hence, they accelerate the metabolism of theophylline and decrease its effect. 3. Cimetidine/ciproﬂoxacin/erythromycin /H11003 theophylline: They are enzyme inhibitors; hence, potentiate the effects of theophylline by interfering with its  metabolism.Uses of Methylxanthines 1. Bronchial asthma and COPD: Theophylline is used as an additional drug in mod-erate or severe persistent bronchial asthma. 2. Apnoea in premature infants: Aminophylline/caffeine is used intravenously to reduce the duration of apnoea episodes. Caffeine is safer than aminophylline.Anticholinergics.  Ipratropium bromide and tiotropium bromide are atropine substi-tutes. They selectively block the effects of acetylcholine in the bronchial smooth muscle and cause bronchodilatation. They do not affect mucociliary clearance. They have a slow onset of action and are less effective than sympathomimetic drugs in bronchial asthma. These anticholinergics are the preferred bronchodilators in COPD and can also be used in bronchial asthma. They are administered by inhalational route, and act primarily on larger airways. Tiotropium is longer acting and more efﬁcacious than ipratropium.Combined use of ipratropium with /H92522-adrenergic agonists produces greater and more prolonged bronchodilatation, hence used in acute severe asthma.Leukotriene-Receptor AntagonistsThese drugs competitively block the effects of cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC4 and LTD4) on bronchial smooth muscle.MontelukastZaﬁrlukast(antagonists)Cysteinyl –LT1-receptorsLeukotrienes – LTC4 andLTD(agonists)4Thus, they produce bronchodilatation, suppress bronchial inﬂammation and de-crease hyperreactivity. They are well absorbed after oral administration, highly bound to plasma proteins and metabolized extensively in the liver. They are effective for pro-phylactic treatment of mild asthma and moderate persistent asthma (in combination with other drugs). They are well tolerated, produce few adverse effects – headache, skin rashes and rarely eosinophilia.

They are not bronchodilators. They inhibit the release of various mediators – histamine, LTs, PGs, PAF, etc. by stabilizing mast cell membrane (Fig. 6.7). They also reduce bronchial hyperreactivity to some extent but the AG:AB reaction is not affected. Onset of action is slow.Sodium cromoglycate is not effective orally as it is poorly absorbed from the gut. In bronchial asthma, sodium cromoglycate is given by inhalation.Uses 1. Allergic asthma: As a prophylactic agent to prevent bronchospasm induced by allergens and irritants. 2. It can also be used in allergic conjunctivitis, allergic rhinitis, allergic dermatitis, etc. by topical route as a prophylactic agent.Adverse Effects.  Systemic side effects are rare; it may cause symptoms of local irritation – cough, bronchospasm, headache, nasal congestion, etc.Ketotifen.  Mechanism of action is similar to sodium cromoglycate, has additional H1-blocking effect. It is orally effective but has a slow onset of action.

Inhalational: Beclomethasone, budesonide, ﬂuticasone and ciclesonide.Glucocorticoids induce synthesis of ‘lipocortin’ , which inhibits phospholipase A2 and thereby prevent the formation of various mediators such as PGs, TXA2 and SRS-A. Glucocorticoids have antiallergic, anti-inﬂammatory and immunosuppressant effects. They: 1. Suppress inﬂammatory response to AG:AB reaction. 2. Decrease mucosal oedema. 3. Reduce bronchial hyperreactivity.Glucocorticoids do not have direct bronchodilating effect but they potentiate the effects of /H92522-adrenergic agonists. They also prevent development of tolerance to /H92522-adrenergic agonists.Inhaled glucocorticoids such as beclomethasone, budesonide, ﬂuticasone and cicle-sonide are used as prophylactic agents in bronchial asthma. Inhaled glucocorticoids are used in patients with persistent asthma who require inhaled /H92522-agonists frequently. Ciclesonide is a prodrug, gets activated by esterases in bronchial epithelium. They are well tolerated. Systemic side effects are minimal with these agents. The common side effects are hoarseness of voice, dysphonia and oropharyngeal candidiasis. These can be reduced by using a spacer, rinsing the mouth after each dose; oral thrush can be treated effectively by topical antifungal agent, nystatin or hamycin.Combination of long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) with steroid is available, e.g. ﬂuti-casone /H11001 salmeterol; budesonide /H11001 formoterol. They have synergistic action; used in bronchial asthma and COPD. They are used in moderate and severe persistent asthma.Systemic glucocorticoids are used in acute severe asthma and chronic severe asthma. Long-term use of systemic steroids produce severe side effects such as gastric irritation, Na/H11001 and water retention, hypertension, muscle weakness, osteoporosis and HPA axis suppression.Anti-IgE Monoclonal Antibody: OmalizumabOmalizumab prevents the binding of IgE to mast cell, thus prevents mast cell degranula-tion. It has no effect on IgE already bound to mast cells. It is administered parenterally. It is used in moderate to severe asthma and allergic disorders such as nasal allergy and food allergy. It is approved for use in patients older than 12 years. It causes local side effects such as redness, stinging, itching and induration.Inhalational Devices.  They areI Pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) – It is a handheld device which can be used alone or with spacer. It has a pressurized container (canister) with drug along with a propellant (hydroﬂuroalkane, HFA) and other substances as solution or suspension. A speciﬁc amount of drug is delivered as a ﬁne aerosol into the air-ways. The small particles reach the smaller airways whereas large ones are depos-ited in the oral cavity (minimized by using spacer). Proper coordination is re-quired between use of device and breathing (difﬁcult for children and elderly). Patient has to be trained on correct use of device.I Dry powder inhalers – Spinhaler and Rotahaler. A capsule (rotacap) containing the drug in ﬁne powder form is placed in the Rotahaler.I Nebulizers – useful in acute severe asthma, COPD and for delivering drug in young children and elderly. The drug is delivered in the form of a mist which can easily reach the airways. They are expensive but do not require coordination unlike pMDI.

262PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESAntiasthmatic agents available for inhalation are /H92522-adrenergic agonists (salbutamol, terbutaline, salmeterol and formoterol), anticholinergics (ipratropium bromide and tiotropium bromide), mast cell stabilizers (sodium cromoglycate) and glucocorticoids (ﬂuticasone, beclomethasone, budesonide, etc.).Treatment of Acute Severe Asthma (Status Asthmaticus) 1. Humidiﬁed oxygen inhalation. 2. Nebulized /H92522-adrenergic agonist (salbutamol 5 mg/terbutaline 10 mg) /H11001 anticho-linergic agent (ipratropium bromide 0.5 mg). 3. Systemic glucocorticoids: Intravenous hydrocortisone 200 mg i.v. stat followed by i.v. hydrocortisone 100 mg q6h or oral prednisolone 30–60 mg/day depending on the patient’s condition. 4. Inj salbutamol 0.4 mg i.m. 5. Intravenous ﬂuids to correct dehydration. 6. Potassium supplements: T o correct hypokalaemia produced by repeated doses of salbutamol/terbutaline. 7. Sodium bicarbonate to treat acidosis. 8. Antibiotics to treat infection.Drugs to be avoided in Patients with Bronchial Asthma 1. NSAIDs like aspirin, ibuprofen and diclofenac (paracetamol can be used). 2. /H9252-Adrenergic blockers. 3. Cholinergic agents.

263CHAPTER 7Drugs Used in the Treatment  of Gastrointestinal DiseasesEmetics and Antiemetics  PH1.34Nausea and vomiting are protective reﬂexes that help to remove toxic substances from the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). They are symptoms of altered function but are not diseases. Nausea denotes the feeling of impending vomiting, whereas vomiting refers to forceful expulsion of the contents of stomach and upper intestinal tract through mouth. Retching is the laboured rhythmic respiratory activity that usually precedes vomiting.MECHANISM OF VOMITINGThe act of vomiting is controlled by vomiting centre in the medulla. Stimuli are  relayed to this centre from peripheral areas, i.e. gastric mucosa and other parts of GIT. Sensory stimuli also arise within the central nervous system (CNS) itself (i.e. cerebral cortex and vestibular apparatus) – the impulses are transmitted to vomiting centre (Fig. 7.1).The lack of blood–brain barrier (BBB) at the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) al-lows it to be directly stimulated by blood-borne drugs and toxic substances. Nausea and vomiting may be the symptoms of pregnancy, serious organic disturbances of almost any of the viscera or may be produced by infection, drugs, radiation, painful stimuli, motion sickness, metabolic and emotional disturbances. The main neurotransmitters involved in the control of vomiting are acetylcholine (ACh), histamine, 5-hydroxytryp-tamine (5-HT) and dopamine.EMETICSThe drugs that cause vomiting are called emetics, e.g. mustard, common salt, ipecac and apomorphine. They cause emesis either by stimulation of CTZ or gastric irritation or both. Mustard and common salt are commonly used household emetics. Syrup ipecac is a safer emetic than apomorphine. Emetics are indicated in certain cases of poisoning.Contraindications for the use of emetics: 1. Unconscious patients because of risk of aspiration. 2. Corrosive and caustic poisoning – further damage to oesophageal lining occurs. 3. Poisoning due to CNS stimulants because of risk of precipitation of seizures. 4. Kerosene poisoning as aspiration may occur.ANTIEMETICSThe drugs that are used to prevent or control vomiting are called antiemetics (Table 7.1).

Their antiemetic effect is mainly due to  

266PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESblockade of 5-HT3-receptors on vagal afferents in the gut (peripheral action). In addition, they also block 5-HT3-receptors in the CTZ and solitary tract nucleus (central action).Anticancer drugs and radiotherapyTissue damage (in the gut)Release of serotonin (5-HT) from enterochromaffin cells of intestinal mucosaStimulates vagal afferents in the gut through 5-HT3 receptorsImpulses to CTZ and STNInduce vomiting5-HT3-antagonistsblockPharmacokinetics.  5-HT3 antagonists are well absorbed after oral administration. The metabolites are excreted in urine and faeces. These agents are also available for intravenous administration. Ondansetron can also be administered intramuscularly. Granisetron is more potent and longer acting than ondansetron. Transdermal patch of granisetron is available for prevention of cancer chemotherapy-induced vomiting. Palonosetron has the longest duration of action among (half-life is 40 hours) the 5-HT3 antagonists.Uses 1. 5-HT3 antagonists are the most effective agents for prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). They are effective  for prevention and control of acute phase vomiting following chemotherapy.  Palonosetron is superior to ondansetron in preventing delayed emesis following chemotherapy. Combination with dexamethasone/diazepam/aprepitant enhances the antiemetic efﬁcacy. 2. They are also effective in hyperemesis of pregnancy, postoperative, postradiation and drug-induced vomiting but they are ineffective against motion sickness. 3. Ramosetron can be used in irritable bowel syndrome.Adverse Effects.  5-HT3 antagonists are well tolerated. They may cause headache, dizziness and diarrhoea.Prokinetic Drugs.  Drugs that promote coordinated movement of GIT and hasten gastric emptying are called prokinetic drugs. They include metoclopramide, domperidone, mosapride, itopride, cisapride and levosulpiride. Of these, metoclopramide and dom-peridone are used as antiemetics.Metoclopramide.  Metoclopramide is a dopamine (D2)-receptor antagonist. It has two important actions – central and peripheral.

2677—DRUGS USED IN THE TREATMENT OF GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASES
Central Actions.  The antiemetic effect of metoclopramide is mainly due to blockade of D2-receptors in CTZ. At high concentration, it also blocks 5-HT3-receptors in CTZ (Fig. 7.2).Prokinetic Effect on Upper GITMetoclopramide5-HT4-agonism5-HT3-antagonism in the gutD2-antagonism↑↑ACh secretion from the myenteric motor neuronsMetoclopramide enhances release of ACh from myenteric neurons. This effect is due to D2-antagonism and 5-HT4-agonism in the GI tract. Thus, peripherally, it has prokinetic effect on upper GIT (Fig. 7.2) and enhances the rate of gastric and duodenal emptying.MetoclopramideBlocksD2-receptors inbasal ganglia Extrapyramidalsymptoms

Fig. 7.2 Effects of metoclopramide and domperidone.

268PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESThe effects of metoclopramide on upper GI tract: 1. Increase in tone of lower oesophageal sphincter (LES). 2. Increase in tone and amplitude of antral contractions. 3. Relaxation of pyloric sphincter. 4. Increase in peristalsis of small intestine.Thus, it promotes forward movement of contents in the upper GIT. It does not have signiﬁcant effect on motility of colon.Pharmacokinetics.  Metoclopramide is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. It can also be administered by i.m. or i.v. routes. Onset of action is within half an hour after oral dose; a few minutes after parenteral administration. It has a short half-life of 4 hours; poorly bound to plasma proteins; crosses blood–brain barrier. The drug is partly metabolized and excreted in urine.Uses 1. As an antiemetic: Metoclopramide is effective for prevention and treatment of: (a) Disease-associated vomiting. (b) Drug-induced vomiting (not used to control levodopa-induced vomiting). (c) Postoperative vomiting. (d) Cancer chemotherapy-induced vomiting. It is used in combination with 5-HT3 antagonists/dexamethasone/promethazine/diazepam. (e) Vomiting due to radiation sickness.It is less effective against motion sickness. 2 .  Gastroesophageal reﬂux disease (GERD): Metoclopramide produces symptom-atic relief in patients with reﬂux oesophagitis by increasing the tone of LES.  By prokinetic effect, it also reduces the volume of gastroduodenal contents  that reﬂux into oesophagus. It is less effective than proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2-blockers. 3 .  To  a l l e v i a te  s y m p to m s  a s s o c i a te d  w i t h  g a s t r i c  s t a s i s  i n  p a t i e n t s  w i t h  d i a b e te s , postoperative or idiopathic gastroparesis: Gastric stasis is characterized by upper abdominal discomfort, distension, bloating, nausea, vomiting, etc. By prokinetic effect, it controls the above symptoms. 4. T o stimulate gastric emptying before general anaesthesia in emergency surgeries. 5. Metoclopramide has been used in the treatment of intractable hiccups.Adverse Effects.  They are drowsiness, dizziness and diarrhoea. Acute dystonias (spasm of muscles of face, tongue, neck and back) can occur. Other extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS: tremor, rigidity, etc.) are due to blockade of D2-receptors in basal gan-glia (drug-induced parkinsonism). Acute dystonias can be treated with centrally acting anticholinergics (e.g. benzhexol and benztropine) or antihistamines with anticholiner-gic action (e.g. promethazine and diphenhydramine).Long-term use may lead to gynaecomastia, galactorrhoea and menstrual irregulari-ties due to blockade of inhibitory effect of dopamine on prolactin release.Drug Interactions.  Metoclopramide and levodopa: Metoclopramide crosses BBB, blocks D2-receptors in the basal ganglia, thus interfering with the anti-parkinsonian effect of levodopa. Hence, it is not used to treat levodopa-induced vomiting.Metoclopramide accelerates the absorption of diazepam but reduces digoxin absorp-tion by its prokinetic effect.Domperidone.  It is a butyrophenone derivative (related to haloperidol) and has effects almost similar to metoclopramide. Its antiemetic and prokinetic effects are due 

2697—DRUGS USED IN THE TREATMENT OF GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASESto blockade of D2-receptors (Fig. 7.2). It is less potent and less efﬁcacious than metoclo-pramide. It poorly crosses BBB; hence, extrapyramidal side effects are rare. Atropine blocks the prokinetic effect of metoclopramide but not that of domperidone. It is  usually administered orally, but its oral bioavailability is low because of extensive ﬁrst-pass metabolism; metabolized in liver and metabolites are excreted in urine. Domperi-done is a preferred antiemetic in children, as it rarely produces EPS. It counteracts vomiting induced by levodopa or bromocriptine without affecting their anti-parkinso-nian effect as it poorly crosses BBB. Hence, it is preferred over metoclopramide to treat vomiting induced by these drugs. It increases prolactin levels. The important side effects are dryness of mouth, diarrhoea, headache, skin rashes, galactorrhoea and menstrual irregularities.Other prokinetic agentsCisapride, prokinetic agent, was banned because of its dangerous side effect – ventricular ﬁbrillation (torsades de pointes).MosaprideI The prokinetic effect is due to 5-HT4-agonism; also has weak 5-HT3 antagonistic effectI Does not cause EPS, hyperprolactinaemia (no D2-blocking action)I May be useful in dyspepsia, diabetic gastroparesis, GERDI Side effects are dizziness, diarrhoea, headache, etc.; QT prolongation has been reportedItoprideI Prokinetic effect is due to D2-antagonism and anticholinesterase activityI Drug interactions are rare and does not cause EPSCinitaprideI It blocks 5-HT2 and D2-receptors in the gut. It is useful in GERD.LevosulpirideI It blocks D2-receptors – has prokinetic and antiemetic effects. It is useful in irritable bowel syndrome.Anticholinergics.  Scopolamine (hyoscine) is the drug of choice to prevent motion (travel) sickness. It blocks afferent impulses from vestibular apparatus to the vomiting centre by its anticholinergic action. Its sedative effect also contributes to its antiemetic effect. Scopolamine is administered orally, intramuscularly or as transdermal patch  (see Chap. 2, p. 67).Antihistamines (H1-Blockers).  H1-blockers are mainly useful for the prevention of motion sickness. They are also effective in morning sickness, postoperative and other types of vomiting (Table 7.1). Dimenhydrinate, diphenhydramine, doxylamine, pro-methazine, cinnarizine, cyclizine and meclizine are some of the H1-blockers that have antiemetic properties. Their antiemetic effect is due to sedative, H1 blockade and central anticholinergic actions. Cyclizine and meclizine have less sedative effect. Meclizine has a long duration of action (24 hours).Neuroleptics.  They are potent antiemetics. Their antiemetic effect is due to blockade of D2-receptors in the CTZ. In addition, they have anticholinergic and antihistaminic actions. Among these, prochlorperazine is commonly used as an antiemetic. They are effective in the treatment of vomiting due to drugs, uraemia and systemic infections. Prochlorperazine, in low doses, may be used in hyperemesis gravidarum. They are also useful for the treatment of chemotherapy and radiation-induced vomiting. They are less 

270PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESeffective in motion sickness. The common side effects are sedation, muscle dystonia and other EPS, dryness of mouth, hypotension, etc.Neurokinin (NK1)-Receptor Antagonists.  Aprepitant (orally) and fosaprepitant (infused intravenously) are neurokinin-receptor antagonists. They block action of substance  P in CTZ and NTS. They are highly effective in prevention of delayed emesis following moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy and increase the efﬁcacy of standard antiemetic regimens (e.g. 5-HT3 antagonist /H11001 dexamethasone). They are well tolerated; ﬂatulence can occur.CannabinoidsDronabinol.  It is either obtained from marijuana plant or synthesized and is used to prevent cancer chemotherapy–induced vomiting not responding to other antiemetics. It is effective orally. It produces serious side effects such as sedation, central sympathomi-metic effects (tachycardia, palpitations and hypotension), hallucinations, disorientation and drug dependence – hence kept as a reserve antiemetic.Adjuvant AntiemeticsGlucocorticoids.  Glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone, betamethasone and meth-ylprednisolone are used as adjuvant antiemetics. These agents are commonly used  in combination with ondansetron or metoclopramide in the treatment of anticancer drug-induced acute and delayed vomiting. The beneﬁcial effect of steroids is due to their anti-inﬂammatory property.Benzodiazepines.  Lorazepam, diazepam and alprazolam are used to control psycho-genic and anticipatory vomiting. The beneﬁcial effect is mainly due to their sedative, amnesic and antianxiety effects.Antidiarrhoeal Agents  PH1.34Generally, the term ‘diarrhoea’ denotes passage of unusually loose or watery stools  at least three times or more in a 24-hour period (WHO). Based on the pattern of onset, there are two types of diarrhoea, i.e. acute and chronic. In most of the cases, acute  diarrhoeas are caused by infectious agents. In acute diarrhoea, irrespective of the aetiol-ogy, emphasis is given to prevent dehydration, which is responsible for most of the mortalities. Diarrhoea is called chronic when it persists for more than 2 weeks. In chronic diarrhoea, ﬁnding out the cause is important for effective management.MANAGEMENT OF DIARRHOEA 1. Oral and parenteral rehydration 2. Antimotility agents: Opioids: codeine, loperamide, diphenoxylate 3. Antisecretory agents: Racecadotril, octreotide. 4. Probiotics 5. Antimicrobial agentsOral Rehydration Solution (ORS).  In acute diarrhoea, it is important to maintain water and electrolyte balance with proper ﬂuid replacement (rehydration). Oral rehydration seems to be the simplest, safest and least expensive method of choice for acute diarrhoea. WHO-ORS contains sodium chloride 2.6 g, potassium chloride 1.5 g, sodium citrate 2.9 g  

2717—DRUGS USED IN THE TREATMENT OF GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASESand glucose 13.5 g. It has to be dissolved in 1 L of water. This provides sodium 75 mM, potassium 20 mM, chloride 65 mM, citrate 10 mM and glucose 75 mM. The total osmo-larity is 245 mOsm/L. Amount of sodium and glucose is lower than older preparations; this promotes better absorption of water from the solution. Sodium and potassium are administered to replace the losses. Sodium is transported along with glucose by sodium-glucose cotransporter in the ileum. Citrate, a base, corrects acidosis. ORS decreases stool volume and vomiting. It is also effective in cholera. ORS is also useful in heat stroke and maintenance of hydration in burn patients. In case of severe diarrhoea with dehydra-tion, intravenous ﬂuids are indicated.WHO recommends the use of zinc supplement (10–14 days) with ORS in acute diar-rhoea in children. It decreases intestinal secretions, promotes regeneration of intestinal epithelium and reduces duration and severity of diarrhoea.Antimotility and Antisecretory AgentsCodeine.  It is a natural opium alkaloid. It decreases GI motility and produces consti-pation. It has abuse potential.Diphenoxylate.  It is related to pethidine. In high doses, it has abuse liability, hence is usually available in combination with a small dose of atropine to discourage abuse or overdosage. The side effects are constipation, paralytic ileus and drug addiction. This drug has been banned in many countries.Loperamide.  It is an opiate analogue and has more potent antidiarrhoeal effect than morphine. By interacting with µ-opioid receptors in the gut, loperamide reduces GI mo-tility and increases the anal sphincter tone. It decreases secretion induced by cholera toxin and some toxins of Escherichia coli. It is orally effective and has a rapid onset of action. It poorly penetrates BBB and has no abuse potential. The usual dose of loperamide is 4 mg stat and then 2 mg after each loose stool, but the maximum dose should not exceed  16 mg in 24 hours. It has been used in both acute and chronic diarrhoeas. It can also  be used in travellers’ diarrhoea. The toxic effects are skin rashes, headache and paralytic ileus. It should not be used in children younger than 4 years.Antimotility drugs produce only symptomatic relief in diarrhoea and should be avoided in acute infectious diarrhoeas, as it can lead to penetration of organisms into bloodstream. These drugs also increase intraluminal pressure; hence, they should be avoided in inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD).Clonidine.  It has an antisecretory as well as antimotility effect. It has been used to control diarrhoea due to opioid withdrawal and in diabetes patients with autonomic neuropathy. The side effects are depression and hypotension.Octreotide.  It is an analogue of somatostatin which is useful in secretory diarrhoea due to hormone-secreting tumours of the GIT and pancreas. It inhibits secretion of 5-HT, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), gastrin, insulin, etc. It is administered either intravenously or subcutaneously. It can be used to treat diarrhoea in patients with AIDS.Racecadotril.  Racecadotril (prodrug)  active metabolite  enkephalinase inhibi-tor  i n h i b i t s  d e g r a d a t i o n  o f  e n k e p h a l i n s  (/H9262//H9254 a g o n i s t s )  i n  i n t e s t i n a l  m u c o s a   increases the concentration of enkephalins in intestinal mucosa  decrease in intestinal secretion. It is used in acute secretory diarrhoeas. It can be used in children. Side effects are nausea, vomiting and drowsiness.ProbioticsThey consist of either bacteria or yeast like Lactobacillus, Biﬁdobacterium and Saccharomy-ces boulardii. They may produce beneﬁcial effect by competing with pathogens in the gut.

272PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES
AntimicrobialsIrrational use of antimicrobials should be avoided. They are indicated in acute bloody diarrhoea. They are also useful in cholera, pseudomembranous enterocolitis and  amoebic dysentery. A list of antimicrobials is provided in Table 7.2.Pharmacotherapy of Inﬂammatory Bowel Disease  PH1.34IBD includes Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis, which are characterized by diarrhoea, bleeding, abdominal discomfort, anaemia and weight loss.COMMONLY USED DRUGS 1.

broken down by colonic bacteria to 5-ASA and sulphapyridine. The released 5-ASA acts locally by inhibiting the production of inﬂammatory mediators. Sulphapyridine gets absorbed and causes side effects like nausea, vomiting and headache. Allergic side effects are skin rashes, fever, hepatitis, pancreatitis, pneumonitis, etc. T o avoid the side effects of sulphapyridine, several 5-ASA compounds have been developed which can be directly targeted to the colon.Mesalamine, Olsalazine and Balsalazide.  Mesalamine (mesalazine) is 5-ASA. Mesalamine is well absorbed in the upper GIT; therefore, it has to be given as special formulations (delayed release capsules or pH-dependent tablets). It can be administered as supposi-tory or enema.Olsalazine is composed of two molecules of 5-ASA with an azo linkage. It is poorly absorbed after oral administration. In the colon, it is cleaved into two molecules of 5-ASA by colonic bacteria.Balsalazide is split into 5-ASA and a metabolite in the colon.Mesalamine, olsalazine and balsalazide have a lower incidence of side effects than sulphasalazine. They may cause headache and skin rashes. Diarrhoea is common with olsalazine.5-ASA agents are mainly effective for mild to moderate ulcerative colitis.GlucocorticoidsGlucocorticoids are used for the short-term treatment of moderate to severe IBD.  Various glucocorticoids used in IBD are prednisolone (oral), methylprednisolone (oral, parenteral), hydrocortisone (enema, suppository) and budesonide (oral). Prolonged use of glucocorticoids can lead to hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis suppression and other side effects like osteoporosis, peptic ulcer, infections and hyperglycaemia.AntibioticsMetronidazole, ciproﬂoxacin and clarithromycin are used as adjuncts in patients with active Crohn disease.ImmunosuppressantsAzathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate and cyclosporine are used in severe dis-ease or in patients with steroid-dependent/steroid unresponsive IBD.Biological Response ModiﬁersInﬂiximab, adalimumab (TNF-/H9251 inhibitors) and certolizumab can be used in severe cases of Crohn disease and refractory ulcerative colitis. The main disadvantages of bio-logics are their cost and increased susceptibility to infections.ProbioticsProbiotics (e.g. Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, etc.) are used to restore the intestinal ﬂora; useful as adjunct therapy in patients with severe IBD.Sulphasalazine,olsalazine,balsalazideMesalamineInhibits production of inﬂammatory mediators – interleukin (IL-1), tumour necrosis factor (TNFα), leukotrienes (LTs), etc.Beneﬁcial effect in inﬂammatory bowel diseaseFig. 7.3 Aminosalicylates and their mechanism of action.

274PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESLaxatives (Purgatives, Cathartics)  PH1.34Laxatives are drugs that facilitate evacuation of formed stools from the bowel. Purgatives cause evacuation of watery stools. The terms laxatives, purgatives and cathartics are often used interchangeably.CLASSIFICATION (ACCORDING TO MECHANISM OF ACTION) 1. Bulk laxativesI Dietary ﬁbre – Bran, methylcellulose, ispaghula (isabgol) 2. Stimulant or irritant laxativesI Bisacodyl, sodium picosulphate, senna, cascara sagrada, lubiprostone, prucalo-pride 3. Osmotic laxativesI Magnesium sulphate, magnesium hydroxide, sodium phosphate, sodium sulphate, lactulose, lactitol, polyethylene glycol 4. Stool softeners (emollient laxatives)I Docusates, liquid parafﬁnBulk-Forming LaxativesThey are indigestible, hydrophilic substances like bran, methylcellulose, agar and ispa-ghula, which absorb water, swell up and increase the bulk of stools. They cause me-chanical distension, so stimulate peristalsis and promote defaecation. It takes 1–3 days for the evacuation of formed stools. Ispaghula is obtained from the seed of Plantago ovata. Large amount of water should be taken with bulk purgatives to avoid intestinal obstruction. Dietary ﬁbres like pectin-bind bile acids increase their excretion in faeces and lower plasma LDL. Fibre diet should be encouraged in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, but should be avoided in those with megacolon or megarectum. The side effects include abdominal discomfort and ﬂatus.Stool Softeners (Emollient laxatives)Docusates.  Common docusate salts are dioctyl sodium sulphosuccinate (DOSS) and dioctyl calcium sulphosuccinate. They are anionic surfactants. They lower the surface tension of stool, thereby cause accumulation of ﬂuid and fatty substance, thus softening the stools. These agents act within 1–3 days. They are administered orally or as a reten-tion enema. Docusates increase the absorption of liquid parafﬁn, hence should not be given together.Liquid Parafﬁn (Note the ‘Ls’).  Liquid parafﬁn is a mineral oil and is administered orally. It softens stools. It also has a Lubricant effect which helps in smooth defaecation. It is useful in patients with cardiac disease because it prevents straining during defaeca-tion.Adverse Effects of Liquid Parafﬁn 1. Lipid pneumonia may occur due to entry of drug into lungs; hence, liquid parafﬁn should not be given at bed time and in lying down position. 2. Long-term use may cause malabsorption of vitamins A, D, E and K (fat-soluble vitamins). 3. Leakage of faecal matter through anal sphincter may lead to soiling of clothes.

2757—DRUGS USED IN THE TREATMENT OF GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASESStimulant (Irritant) LaxativesThese agents have direct action on enteric neurons and GI mucosa. They increase pros-taglandin (PG) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, but inhibit Na/H11001, K/H11001-ATPase activity in the intestinal mucosa. This causes an increased secretion of water and electrolytes by the mucosa thus stimulating peristalsis. They cause evacuation of semiﬂuid stools. Chronic use of stimulant laxatives may cause atonic colon. Large doses may cause loss of ﬂuid and electrolytes. They are contraindicated in pregnancy as they cause reﬂex stimulation of uterus.Bisacodyl.  The major site of action is colon. It is available as an enteric-coated oral tablet and also as a rectal suppository. It is poorly absorbed after oral administration  and undergoes activation by esterases in the bowel. Hence, the effect is seen only after 6–8 hours of oral administration. Therefore, it is usually given at bed time. Rectal  suppositories act more rapidly within an hour by irritation of rectal mucosa. Bisacodyl is used in constipation and to empty the bowel before endoscopy, surgery and radio-logical investigations. The side effects are local irritation and inﬂammation.Sodium Picosulphate.  It is a stimulant purgative given orally at bed time. It can be used to evacuate the bowel before surgery or colonoscopy.Prucalopride.  Prucalopride, a prokinetic drug, is a 5-HT4 agonist. It is useful in chronic constipation not responding to laxatives. It increases colonic motility.Lubiprostone.  Lubiprostone, a PG analogue, is useful in chronic constipation and irri-table bowel syndrome. It increases intestinal secretion.Anthraquinone Derivatives.  The popular anthracene purgatives are senna and cascara. They take 6–8 hours to act, hence are usually administered at bed time to produce their effect in the morning. They are poorly absorbed in the small intestine. The unabsorbed portion reaches the colon, where it is reduced by bacteria to anthrol that acts locally  and induces purgation. They should not be prescribed to lactating mothers, as they  are secreted in milk. The side effects are skin rashes, black pigmentation of the colonic mucosa and discolouration of urine. Prolonged use can cause colonic atony.Osmotic LaxativesThey are salts of magnesium, sodium or potassium. Those having magnesium or phos-phate are known as saline laxatives.Act on the small and  large intestine (within 1–3 hours)Not absorbed in the gutDraw ﬂuid into the lumen by osmotic activityDistend the bowelStimulate peristalsisEvacuation of watery stools in 1–3 hoursOsmotic purgativesare given orally,early morning onempty stomachwith plenty of water 

276PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES
In addition, magnesium salts cause release of cholecystokinin. T o mask the bitter taste, they are often administered with fruit juice. The important osmotic laxatives are magnesium sulphate (Epsom salt), magnesium hydroxide (milk of magnesia), sodium phosphate, lactulose, etc. They should be avoided in young children and patients with renal failure, as they may cause CNS or cardiac depression.Sodium phosphate is commonly used orally for colon preparation before surgery or colonoscopy. It can also be used as an enema. Sodium salts should be avoided in cardiac patients.Lactulose.  Lactulose is a disaccharide of fructose and galactose. Lactulose is available as liquid and powder. On oral administration, it is not absorbed through GI mucosa. Colonic bacteria convert it into acidic products, which exert osmotic effect – draw ﬂuid into the lumen and distend it, thus useful in constipation. It produces soft to loose stools. It can be used to treat constipation in children and pregnant women. Lactulose is used in hepatic coma to reduce blood ammonia levels (Fig. 7.4). The side effects include abdominal discomfort and ﬂatulence.Lactitol.  Its actions are similar to lactulose. It is useful in constipation and hepatic encephalopathy.Polyethylene Glycol.  It is an osmotic laxative which is used to evacuate the bowel prior to surgical, radiological and endoscopic procedures. It is available as powder and solution. The powder should be mixed with water or fruit juice.USES OF LAXATIVES WITH PREFERRED PREPARATIONS 1. Acute functional constipation (atonic or spastic) – bulk laxatives. 2. T o prevent straining during defaecation in patients with cardiovascular disease, eye surgery, hernia, etc. – docusates or bulk laxatives. 3. In patients with hepatic coma to reduce the blood ammonia level – lactulose. 4. Preoperatively in bowel surgery, colonoscopy and abdominal X-ray – osmotic laxatives or bisacodyl. 5. Following anthelmintics (e.g. for Taenia solium) – saline laxatives are used to expel the worm segments. 6. In drug poisoning to wash out the poisonous material from the gut – saline laxatives. 7. T o treat constipation in children and pregnant women – lactulose.Treatment of opioid-induced constipationLaxatives are the preferred drugs. If patient does not respond to laxatives, opioid antagonists like methylnaltrexone and naloxegol can be used.

2777—DRUGS USED IN THE TREATMENT OF GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASESnaloxegol (oral) are peripherally acting µ-opioid receptor antagonists. They are devoid of central effects; used to treat opioid-induced constipation in cancer patients. Adverse effects are nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.Pharmacotherapy of Peptic Ulcer and Gastroesophageal Reﬂux Disease  PH1.34Physiology of gastric secretionThe stomach secretes roughly about 2–3 litres of gastric juice per day. The chief  or peptic cells secrete pepsinogen, which is converted to pepsin by gastric acid. Parietal or oxyntic cells secrete acid and intrinsic factor (IF). Superﬁcial epithelial cells secrete alkaline mucus and bicarbonate ions.Regulation of gastric acid secretionThe secretion of gastric acid by parietal cells is regulated by ACh, histamine, gastrin and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Binding of histamine, ACh and gastrin to their speciﬁc recep-tors on the parietal cell results in increased secretion of gastric acid. In contrast, the binding of PGE2 to its receptor decreases gastric acid secretion. There are various phases of gastric acid secretion – basal, cephalic and hormonal. A membrane-bound proton pump H/H11001, K/H11001-ATPase plays an important role in the ﬁnal step of gastric acid secretion.Damage to the mucosa and deeper tissue exposed to acid and pepsin is known as peptic ulcer. The exact cause of peptic ulcer is not clear. In most of the cases, peptic ulcers are caused by Helicobacter pylori infection or the use of nonsteroidal anti-inﬂam-matory drugs (NSAIDs).CLASSIFICATION OF DRUGS USED IN PEPTIC ULCERDrugs used in peptic ulcer are classiﬁed as follows (Fig. 7.5): 1. Drugs that inhibit gastric acid secretion (a) PPIs: Omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole. (b) H2-receptor antagonists (H2-blockers): Cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, rox-atidine, nizatidine.AntacidsNeutralizeDecreasesecretion ofProtectACIDUlcerPPIsProstaglandinsH -blockers2•••SucralfateCBS••Fig. 7.5 Drugs used in peptic ulcer.

Drugs that neutralize gastric acid (antacids) (a) Nonsystemic antacids: Magnesium hydroxide, magnesium trisilicate, alumin-ium hydroxide, calcium carbonate. (b) Systemic antacids: Sodium bicarbonate, sodium citrate. 4. Anti-H. pylori agentsAmoxicillin, tetracycline, clarithromycin, metronidazole, tinidazole, bismuth subsalicylate, H2-antagonists, PPIs.Drugs That Inhibit Gastric Acid SecretionProton-Pump Inhibitors (PPIs).  Proton pump (H/H11001, K/H11001-ATPase) is a membrane-bound enzyme that plays an important role in the ﬁnal step of gastric acid secretion (basal and stimulated; Fig. 7.6). Omeprazole is the prototype drug. The other PPIs are lansoprazole, pantoprazole and rabeprazole. PPIs (prodrugs) nabsorbed in small intestine n blood n diffuse into parietal cells n canaliculi of the cell (acidic pH) n converted to sul-phenamide (active, charged form). The activated form (sulphenamide) binds covalently with SH group of the proton pump and irreversibly inactivates it. PPIs are the most powerful inhibitors of gastric acid secretion. They inhibit both fasting and stimulated acid secretion. As PPIs act in the ﬁnal step of acid secretion, they are effective in inhibit-ing acid production following any stimulation. PPIs are administered orally about  30 minutes before food because food stimulates secretion of acid (in the canaliculi  of parietal cell), which is necessary for activation of PPIs. Food decreases absorption of PPIs. Though the half-life of PPIs is short (/H110111.5 hours), acid secretion is suppressed for up to 24 hours as they cause irreversible inhibition of proton pumps. In the commonly used doses, PPIs suppress acid production by about 80%–98%. PPIs are available as enteric coated form or as powder containing sodium bicarbonate to prevent their acti-vation by acid in the stomach. Esomeprazole, pantoprazole and lansoprazole have higher oral bioavailability than omeprazole. Ilaprazole is more potent than omeprazole. Parenteral (i.v.) formulations are available for esomeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole BloodParietal cellCanaliculi(acidic pH)PPIsPPIsPPIsSulfenamide /H11002ProtonpumpFig. 7.6 Mechanism of action of proton-pump inhibitors.

2797—DRUGS USED IN THE TREATMENT OF GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASESand rabeprazole. They are highly bound to plasma proteins; extensively metabolized in liver and metabolites are excreted in urine.Therapeutic Uses 1. Peptic ulcer: PPIs are the most powerful acid suppressive agents. They inhibit all phases of gastric acid secretion. PPIs are superior to H2-blockers as their onset of action is rapid and cause faster ulcer healing. The standard dose of omeprazole is 20 mg, lansoprazole 30 mg and pantoprazole 40 mg once daily. Duodenal ulcers require 4 weeks’ therapy and gastric ulcers require 6–8 weeks’ therapy for healing.In acute bleeding ulcers, intravenous PPIs are preferred. By suppressing acid secretion, they promote healing of ulcer.H. pylori–associated ulcers: Combination therapy of two or three antimicrobials and a PPI is the most effective regimen for these ulcers.Stress ulcers (Curling ulcer): Prophylactic use of intravenous PPIs reduce the incidence of stress ulcers in critically ill patients.NSAID-induced ulcers: PPIs are more effective than H2-blockers for prevention and treatment of NSAID-induced ulcers. 2. PPIs can be used preoperatively to reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia. 3. Zollinger–Ellison (Z–E) syndrome: Z–E syndrome is characterized by hypergas-trinaemia with multiple peptic ulcers. PPIs are the preferred agents for Z–E  syndrome. Higher doses of PPIs are needed for healing of ulcers. Surgery is the deﬁnitive treatment. In inoperable cases, prolonged therapy with PPIs has been recommended. 4. Gastroesophageal reﬂux disease: In GERD, the goal of therapy is to produce symptom relief, heal erosive oesophagitis and prevent complications. PPIs are the preferred agents for the treatment of GERD and are usually given once daily. They are more effective than H2-blockers. Patients with erosive oesophagitis or peptic ulcer with stricture need prolonged maintenance therapy with PPIs.Adverse Effects.  PPIs are generally well tolerated. The side effects are headache, nausea, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Skin rashes and arthralgia can rarely occur. Long-term use of PPIs can decrease vitamin B12 absorption, increase the risk of infections (e.g. hospital-acquired pneumonia) and osteoporosis. Chronic use also results in hypergastri-naemia which may predispose to gastric tumours. Gynaecomastia and erectile dysfunc-tion with omeprazole therapy have been reported.Drug interactions. Omeprazole can inhibit the metabolism of drugs like phenytoin, warfarin and diazepam. PPIs decrease the bioavailability of itraconazole, iron salts, etc. Drug interactions are minimal with pantoprazole.H2-Receptor Antagonists (H2-Blockers)Histamine(Agonist)• Cimetidine••• Ranitidine Famotidine  Nizatidine (Antagonists)Parietal cellH2-receptorsMechanism of Action.  H2-receptor antagonists competitively block H2-receptors on parietal cell and inhibit gastric acid production. They suppress all phases (basal, cephalic and gastric) of acid secretion. They are mainly effective in suppressing nocturnal acid secretion. H2-blockers also reduce acid secretion stimulated by ACh, gastrin, food, etc. 

280PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESThey are less potent than PPIs – 24-hour acid secretion is suppressed by 60%–70%.  Cimetidine is the prototype drug and was the ﬁrst H2-blocker developed. It is seldom used now because of its adverse effects (Table 7.3).H2-blockers are usually administered orally and are well absorbed; metabolized in liver and the metabolites are excreted in urine. Cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine are also available for intravenous administration.I Nizatidine: All the features are similar to ranitidine but it has higher bioavailability (almost 100%).I Famotidine: Most of the features are similar to ranitidine. It is more potent and longer acting than ranitidine. It has no antiandrogenic effect. Drug interactions are negligible.I Lafutidine: It is an H2-receptor blocker and decreases acid secretion. It increases mucosal blood ﬂow and mucin synthesis. Nitric oxide production is increased.Therapeutic Uses 1. Peptic ulcer: H2-blockers are one of the commonly used drugs in peptic ulcer. H2-blockers produce symptomatic relief within days and ulcer healing within weeks. The duration of treatment for duodenal ulcer is 4–6 weeks. Gastric ulcer requires prolonged therapy for 6–8 weeks. But, PPIs are more frequently used because they have higher efﬁcacy and are well tolerated.I H. pylori–associated ulcers: H2-blockers can be used along with antimicrobial agents to treat H. pylori infection.I Stress ulcers are commonly seen in critically ill patients with severe medical or surgical illness. They may be associated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Intravenous H2-blockers are used to prevent and treat stress-related ulcer and bleeding.I NSAID-induced ulcers: H2-blockers can be used for healing of NSAID-induced ulcers but they are less effective than PPIs.CimetidineRanitidine 1.

2817—DRUGS USED IN THE TREATMENT OF GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASES 2. Gastroesophageal reﬂux disease: In GERD, H2-blockers are effective and produce symptomatic relief. PPIs are more effective than H2-blockers. 3. Zollinger–Ellison syndrome: In Z–E syndrome, surgery is the deﬁnitive therapy. PPIs or H2-blockers are used to control the hypersecretion of acid. PPIs are the preferred agents in Z–E syndrome. 4. H2-blockers are used preoperatively to reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia.Anticholinergic Agents.  Pirenzepine and telenzepine, selective M1-receptor blockers, in-hibit acid secretion. They are not commonly used because of their low efﬁcacy and an-ticholinergic side effects.Prostaglandin Analogues.  Misoprostol, a synthetic PG analogue (PGE1), is effective orally for prevention and treatment of NSAID-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers.  PGs inhibit gastric acid secretion, increase mucus and bicarbonate secretion; they  also increase mucosal blood ﬂow (cytoprotective effect). The common side effects are diarrhoea and abdominal cramps. Misoprostol is contraindicated in pregnancy, as  it may cause uterine contractions. Because of its adverse effects and need for frequent dosing, it is rarely used.Ulcer ProtectivesSucralfate.  It is a complex of aluminium hydroxide and sulphated sucrose. In the acidic environment of stomach (pH /H11021 4), sucralfate undergoes polymerization to form a sticky polymer that adheres to the ulcer base and protects it. It also precipitates proteins at the ulcer base – forms a barrier against acid–pepsin. It stimulates the release of PGs and epidermal growth factor locally, thus produces cytoprotective effect. It also increases mucus and bicarbonate secretion – enhances mucosal defence and repair.Sucralfate is given orally on an empty stomach at least 1 hour before meals. It reduces the absorption of drugs, such as digoxin, tetracyclines, ketoconazole and ﬂuoroquino-lones. Since it requires pH /H11021 4 for activation, concurrent administration of antacids, H2-blockers or PPIs should be avoided. Constipation is a common side effect. Nausea may occur. Aluminium toxicity can occur in patients with renal failure.After the introduction of PPIs, sucralfate is seldom used in peptic ulcer. Sucralfate is effective for prevention of bleeding from stress ulcers and to reduce the risk of  aspiration pneumonia. It is also useful in GERD with oesophagitis, as it is a mucosal protector. Other uses are oral mucositis, radiation proctitis, rectal ulcer, burns, bed sores, etc.Bismuth-Containing Preparations.  Bismuth subsalicylate and CBS are the most commonly used oral bismuth preparations. Their mode of action is not clear. They probably: 1. Precipitate proteins and protect ulcer base. 2. Stimulate the secretion of PGE2, mucus and bicarbonate. 3. Have antimicrobial effect against H. pylori.They are one of the components in certain anti-H. pylori regimens. The side effects are blackening of the tongue and stools.Drugs that Neutralize Gastric Acid (Antacids)Antacids are weak bases that neutralize gastric acid and raise the gastric pH. They do not affect acid production. Acid neutralizing capacity reﬂects the potency of an antacid.An Ideal Antacid 1. should be insoluble and capable of neutralizing acid. 2. should not liberate CO2.

282PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES 3. should be nonabsorbable. 4. should not disturb the acid–base balance of the body.Types of Antacids 1. Nonsystemic: Magnesium hydroxide, magnesium trisilicate, aluminium hydrox-ide gel and calcium carbonate. 2. Systemic: Sodium bicarbonate and sodium citrate.Nonsystemic Antacids.  Magnesium hydroxide, magnesium trisilicate, aluminium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, etc. form respective chloride salts in stomach. When this reaches the intestine, the chloride salt reacts with bicarbonate, so HCO3– is not available for absorption; hence, there is no systemic alkalosis.Combination of antacids produces various beneﬁcial effects. They are as follows: 1. Aluminium salts cause constipation and magnesium salts cause diarrhoea, so combination of these two can counteract the adverse effects of each other. 2. Magnesium hydroxide has a rapid onset of action, but aluminium hydroxide acts slowly – the combined product produces rapid and sustained effect. 3. Dose of individual antacid is reduced; hence, systemic toxicity is minimized.Calcium may be absorbed from its salts resulting in hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria.Systemic AntacidsSodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3).  It rapidly neutralizes gastric acid, but the duration of action is short. The disadvantages of NaHCO3 are that (i) it is highly water soluble and rapidly absorbed from the gut; (ii) it releases CO2 that can cause abdominal distension and belching; (iii) it may cause metabolic alkalosis; and (iv) it produces rebound acidity.Sodium bicarbonate is also used to alkalinize urine and to treat acidosis. It should be avoided in patients with hypertension and congestive cardiac failure (CCF), as it causes sodium retention.Formulations.  Antacids are available as suspension, tablet and powder. Tablet should be chewed and swallowed for better effect. Suspensions have better neutralizing capacity than other formulations.Drug Interactions.  All antacids increase the pH of stomach and form insoluble and nonabsorbable complexes with many drugs – iron, tetracyclines, ﬂuoroquinolones, keto-conazole, etc.; thus, antacids reduce the absorption of these drugs. There should be a gap of 2 hours between administration of these drugs and antacids.Antifoaming Agents Methylpolysiloxane (simethicone and dimethicone): They are antifoaming agents, usu-ally present in some antacid preparations. They decrease foaming and relieve ﬂatulence.Oxethazaine: It is a topical anaesthetic and is used to anaesthetize gastric mucosa. It produces symptomatic relief in gastritis and GERD. It is available in combination  with antacids.Sodium alginate: It forms froth on the contents in the stomach – prevents effects of gastroesophageal reﬂux.Anti-H. pylori AgentsH. pylori, Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium, is associated with gastritis, duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer and gastric carcinoma (Fig. 7.7).The mechanism by which H. pylori causes mucosal inﬂammation and damage is not clear. The ammonia produced by urease activity may directly damage the cells.

2837—DRUGS USED IN THE TREATMENT OF GASTROINTESTINAL DISEASES
Many regimens are available for the eradication of H. pylori. Combination therapy (triple/quadruple) is always recommended. The objectives of combination therapy are as follows: 1. T o prevent or delay the development of resistant organism. 2. T o prevent relapse. 3. T o promote rapid ulcer healing. 4. T o eradicate H. pylori infection.The duration of treatment could be 1 week or 2 weeks, of which 14-day therapy is more effective.The antimicrobials used in H. pylori infection are amoxicillin, tetracycline, clarithro-mycin, metronidazole and tinidazole. Resistance develops rapidly to metronidazole and clarithromycin but not to amoxicillin. Amoxicillin should be avoided in patients with history of penicillin allergy. Other anti-H. pylori drugs are PPIs, H2-blockers and CBS. Some of the recommended regimens are listed below:Triple Therapy /H11003 14 Days (2 W eeks)I Lansoprazole 30 mg b.d /H11001I Clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. /H11001I Amoxicillin 1 g b.d.Quadruple Therapy /H11003 14 Days (2 W eeks)I Omeprazole 20 mg b.d. /H11001I CBS 120 mg q.i.d. /H11001I T etracycline 500 mg q.i.d./H11001I Metronidazole 400 mg t.i.d.After completion of the above-recommended regimen, PPI should be continued for 6 more weeks to enhance ulcer healing.DRUGS USEFUL IN GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE  PH1.34 1.

Local Haemostatics (Styptics).  These drugs are commonly used locally to control bleed-ing from capillaries and minute vessels, e.g. bleeding following tooth extraction, abra-sions, epistaxis, etc.Astringents. They precipitate proteins locally in the bleeding site and control capillary oozing, e.g. solution of ferric chloride, tannic acid, etc. They are useful in bleeding gums.Adrenaline.  It causes vasoconstriction (/H92511) and arrests bleeding. A cotton pad soaked in 0.1% adrenaline solution is applied on the bleeding site to control capillary oozing, e.g. epistaxis, bleeding after tooth extraction, etc. Adrenaline should be avoided in pa-tients with hypertension, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, ischaemic heart disease and uncontrolled hyperthyroidism as it may precipitate myocardial infarction (MI) or aggravate the existing condition.Thrombin. It is a freeze-dried powder derived from bovine or human plasma. It is used topically to control bleeding from capillaries. It can cause hypersensitivity  reactions. Thrombin should not be injected.Fibrin. It consists of ﬁbrinogen, factor XIII, thrombin, Ca2/H11001 and other clotting components. It is used to control bleeding during surgical procedures or as a spray on bleeding surface.Gelatin. It is an absorbable haemostatic and is available as a sponge or ﬁlm. It produces haemostasis by providing a physical meshwork on which clotting can occur.

286PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESCalcium Alginate.  It is obtained from sea weeds. It is an absorbable haemostatic and is used to promote wound healing.Oxidized Cellulose. It is an absorbable haemostatic. It should be applied dry so that it swells up and helps in the formation of clot. It is used to control bleeding from capil-laries and arterioles where ligation is not possible. It may cause tissue necrosis, nerve damage or vascular stenosis.Haemocoagulase.  Haemocoagulase enzyme complex is isolated from the venom of Bothrops atrox (viper). It has a powerful haemostatic effect. It promotes coagulation by converting ﬁbrinogen to ﬁbrin. It can also shorten bleeding and clotting time, thereby  reducing blood loss. It is available for topical, intravenous (i.v.), intramuscular (i.m.) and subcutaneous (s.c.) administration.Systemic AgentsVitamin K.  Vitamin K, a fat-soluble vitamin, is required for the synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX and X. Vitamin K exists in different forms: vitamin K1 (phytonadione, fat soluble) is from plant and animal source, vitamin K2 ( m e n a q u i n o n e )  i s  p r o d u c e d  b y  i n t e s t i n a l  b a c t e r i a ,  whereas vitamin K3 (menadione – fat soluble; salts are water soluble) is a synthetic form.Dietary Source. Vitamin K is found in spinach, cabbage, cauliﬂower and tomatoes. It is also present in butter, meat, milk, liver and pears. The average daily intake for an adult is estimated to be 70–140 mcg/day.Pharmacokinetics. Vitamin K1 and menadione require the presence of bile for their absorption. Vitamin K is transported along with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and is stored mainly in liver. Its metabolites are excreted in bile and urine.Actions.  Vitamin K acts as a cofactor for /H9253-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues of clotting factors II, VII, IX, X (which allows them to bind calcium and membrane phos-pholipids during the process of coagulation) and osteocalcin (bone protein which is important for bone development).Deﬁciency.  Vitamin K deﬁciency may occur due to inadequate absorption (lack of bile salts), loss of vitamin (chronic diarrhoea) and administration of broad-spectrum antibiot-ics (suppression of bacterial ﬂora). In vitamin K deﬁciency, there is an increased tendency to bleed – epistaxis, haematuria, gastrointestinal bleeding and postoperative bleeding.Adverse Effects. Oral vitamin K is safe. Intravenous injection may cause ﬂushing, sweat-ing, dyspnoea, cyanosis, collapse and anaphylactoid reactions. Menadione may cause haemolysis, hyperbilirubinaemia and kernicterus in newborn.PreparationsPhytonadione (vitamin K1): It is available for oral, s.c., i.m. and i.v. administration.Menadione sodium diphosphate (vitamin K3): It is a water-soluble preparation and is available for i.v., i.m. and oral administration. Menadione and its water-soluble salts have low efﬁcacy and are toxic, hence they are not commonly used.Uses.  For prevention and treatment of bleeding associated with vitamin K deﬁciency: 1. In obstructive jaundice with haemorrhagic symptoms, parenteral vitamin K1 is preferred. It is also administered to treat vitamin K deﬁciency resulting from  prolonged antimicrobial therapy. 2. Vitamin K1 (1 mg phytonadione, i.m.) is given routinely to all neonates to prevent bleeding, as the intestinal ﬂora, which is necessary for the synthesis of vitamin K, is not developed. 3.

Vitamin K1 is used in salicylate poisoning with haemorrhagic complications.Antihaemophilic Factor. It contains coagulation factor VIII with von Willebrand’s factor. It is administered as i.v. infusion to control bleeding episodes in haemophiliacs. Adverse effects include fever with chills, headache and skin rashes.

It is used to control capillary oozing following tooth extraction, epistaxis,  haematuria, etc.Ethamsylate. It is a haemostatic available for oral and i.v. administration. It corrects abnormal platelet adhesion and maintains stability of the capillary wall. It is used to prevent and control bleeding from small blood vessels, e.g. menorrhagia, bleeding  following tooth extraction. It may cause skin rashes, hypotension and headache.Desmopressin.  It is a synthetic analogue of vasopressin. It is administered as an i.v. infu-sion to control mild to moderate bleeding in haemophilia A and von Willebrand’s disease.Fibrinogen.  It is obtained from human plasma. It is used to control bleeding associ-ated with hypoﬁbrinogenaemia and is infused intravenously.ANTICOAGULANTSAnticoagulants are drugs that prevent or reduce coagulability of blood.Classiﬁcation 1.

Heparin, the strongest organic acid in the body, was discovered by a medical student, McLean. It was later isolated and identiﬁed by Howell as a sulphated mucopolysaccharide. It is strongly electronegative. Commer-cially, heparin is obtained from ox lung and pig intestinal mucosa.Mechanism of Action (Fig. 8.1).  Heparin binds to plasma antithrombin III (AT III) and ac-tivates it. For binding to A T III, ﬁve saccharides (pentasaccharide) of heparin is essential.  The heparin–antithrombin III complex enhances the rate of inactivation of activated clotting factors Xa, IIa, IXa, XIa, XIIa and XIIIa. T o accelerate IIa (thrombin) inactivation, heparin  must bind to A T III as well as thrombin. This requires a long length of heparin (18 saccharides). For inactivation of factor Xa, binding of heparin (pentasaccharides) to A T III only is required.At low concentration, heparin selectively inhibits the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Heparin thus prevents further thrombus formation. Heparin, in high doses,

Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) inhibit Xa through antithrombin.has antiplatelet action and prolongs the bleeding time. It releases lipoprotein lipase which hydrolyses triglycerides, resulting in clearing of lipaemic plasma.Pharmacokinetics.  Heparin is not absorbed after oral administration because of its high negative charge and large molecular size. Therefore, it must be given parenterally – intrave-nously or subcutaneously. On i.v. administration, the anticoagulant effect starts immediately, whereas through s.c. route, it takes 1–2 hours. Heparin is highly protein bound. It does  not cross blood–brain barrier or placental barrier and is safe for use during pregnancy. It is rapidly inactivated in liver by heparinase and the metabolites are excreted in urine.Mode of Administration.  Heparin is usually administered by i.v. infusion (for treatment) or s.c. route (if it cannot be given as i.v. infusion or when given in low dose for prophylaxis). Intramuscular administration may cause haematomas, hence should not be used. During heparin therapy, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) monitoring is necessary and it should be maintained at 1.5–2.5 times the control.Adverse Effects and Contraindications 1. Bleeding: The main side effect is bleeding. Overdosage may cause serious and fatal haemorrhage. Bleeding can occur in urinary (haematuria is generally the earliest sign) and gastrointestinal tract or anywhere in the body. Hence, heparin therapy requires aPTT monitoring. No antagonist is required in cases of mild bleeding,  as effect of heparin disappears within hours of stoppage of therapy. If life- threatening haemorrhage occurs, it can be controlled rapidly by slow i.v. infusion of protamine sulphate (heparin antagonist). It is a strongly basic protein, and hence rapidly neutralizes the anticoagulant effect of heparin.Protaminesulphate(Strongbase)Hepar  /H11003   iin(Strongacid)

2898—DRUGS AFFECTING COAGULATION AND BLOOD FORMATIONProtamine sulphate is a speciﬁc heparin antagonist, which is obtained from ﬁsh sperm. One milligram of protamine sulphate approximately neutralizes  100 units of heparin (chemical antagonism). Protamine sulphate itself may cause bleeding as it has weak anticoagulant effect. Hence, the maximum dose must not exceed 50 mg. 2. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): Heparin rarely causes thrombocyto-penia. It is due to the formation of antibodies against platelet factor–heparin complex leading to a decrease in platelet count. Thrombotic complications can occur. The incidence is higher with UFH than with LMWHs. Heparin should be discontinued. LMWHs cannot be used in such patients. 3. Hypersensitivity reactions can occur rarely. They are skin rashes, urticaria, fever, etc. 4. Osteoporosis: Dose-dependent osteoporosis with spontaneous fractures may occur during long-term therapy. 5. Reversible alopecia has been reported. 6. Abnormalities in liver function test can occur.Heparin is contraindicated in haemophiliacs, patients with HIT, severe hypertension, intracranial haemorrhage, bacterial endocarditis, active tuberculosis, peptic ulcer, threatened abortion, cirrhosis, etc.Low-Molecular-W eight Heparins.  Enoxaparin, dalteparin, tinzaparin, ardeparin, reviparin, etc. are LMWHs and are obtained from standard heparin by fractionation. LMWHs produce anticoagulant effect mainly by inactivation of factor Xa through  antithrombin. As they are not of sufﬁcient length to bind to both thrombin and  antithrombin simultaneously, they have little effect on thrombin inhibition. Hence, LMWH has less effect on aPTT as compared to UFH. LMWH therapy usually does not require aPTT monitoring but patients with chronic renal failure may need monitoring by measuring factor Xa activity since they are excreted through kidney. The effects  of LMWHs are not completely reversed by protamine sulphate. LMWHs are given  subcutaneously. The following are the advantages of LMWHs: 1. They have a higher s.c. bioavailability as compared to UFH. 2. They have a longer t½; can be administered once a day. 3. They do not routinely require aPTT monitoring. 4. There is a lower incidence of thrombocytopaenia and osteoporosis as compared to UFH.(Uses, adverse effects and contraindications are same as other anticoagulants.)Fondaparinux.  It is a synthetic parenteral anticoagulant. It binds to antithrombin and selectively inactivates factor Xa without any effect on thrombin. Fondaparinux is ad-ministered subcutaneously. It is useful in pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombo-sis (DVT). It has a long t1⁄2 of 17 hours and good subcutaneous bioavailability; incidence of thrombocytopaenia and osteoporosis is lower with fondaparinux. It does not require routine laboratory monitoring. Its effects are not reversed by protamine sulphate. Fondaparinux should not be administered in patients with renal failure.Parenteral Direct Thrombin Inhibitors.  They bind directly to thrombin and inactivate it. They do not bind to AT III.Lepirudin, obtained by recombinant DNA technology, inhibits thrombin irreversibly.Argatroban and Bivalirudin are synthetic, reversible direct thrombin inhibitors with rapid onset of action. They are short acting and administered as i.v. infusion. They  are used as anticoagulants in patients who are at risk of HIT. Adverse effect is bleeding. 

290PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESArgatroban affects INR (international normalized ratio). It is secreted in bile and can be used in patients with renal failure.ORAL ANTICOAGULANTS (Table 8.1)Among oral anticoagulants, coumarin derivatives (warfarin and acenocoumarol) are commonly used. Oral anticoagulants act only in vivo. They are vitamin K antagonists.Mechanism of Action. (Fig. 8.2).  Clotting factors II, VII, IX and X are synthesized in liver as inactive proteins. These factors are rich in glutamic acid residues and are carboxylated in liver where vitamin K acts as a cofactor. Carboxylation of glutamic acid residues  is necessary for clotting factors to bind calcium and membrane phospholipids in  coagulation pathway. Vitamin K is converted to inactive epoxide form by oxidation and is regenerated to its active form by vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) enzyme.  Warfarin is a coumarin derivative and has a structure similar to that of vitamin K.  It competitively inhibits epoxide reductase, prevents regeneration of active form of  vitamin K resulting in inhibition of synthesis of factors II, VII, IX and X. The onset  and duration of anticoagulant effect of warfarin depends on the half-lives (in hours) of  clotting factors, which are as follows: VII (6), IX (24), X (36) and II (50). There is always a delay in the onset of anticoagulant effect because the levels of clotting factors already present in plasma decline slowly over a period of 1–3 days.Pharmacokinetics. Warfarin is almost completely absorbed after oral administration. It is highly bound to plasma proteins, freely crosses placental barrier, is metabolized in liver and the inactive metabolites are excreted in urine and stool. It has a long half-life of about 40 hours and the duration of action is 3–6 days.Acenocoumarol.  It has a rapid onset but shorter duration of action than warfarin.HeparinWarfarin 1.

Fig. 8.2 The role of vitamin K in clotting and mechanism of action of warfarin.Adverse Effects 1. Bleeding: Bleeding is the most important and common side effect of warfarin. Bleeding can occur anywhere – skin, pulmonary, gastrointestinal and urinary tract, etc. Oral anti-coagulant therapy is monitored by measuring international normalized ratio (INR).INRPTPTptrefISI/H11005PTpt/H11005 Prothrombin time of patient;PTref /H11005 Prothrombin time of reference sample; ISI /H11005 International sensitivity index.Measurement of prothrombin time measured has been standardized internationally by each laboratory calibrating its own thromboplastin against the standard one.If bleeding is mild, few doses of warfarin can be skipped till INR returns to desired range. If bleeding is severe, warfarin has to be stopped. Bleeding can be controlled by oral or parenteral vitamin K1 (depending on severity). About 6–24 hours is required for the synthesis of clotting factors. Fresh frozen plasma should be given in severe bleeding for immediate replacement of clotting factors. 2. Teratogenic effect: Warfarin is contraindicated during pregnancy as it may cause nasal hypoplasia, CNS abnormalities, fetal haemorrhage, abortion or intrauterine death. 3. Skin necrosis: It is a rare complication that occurs within the ﬁrst week of therapy. The skin lesions are commonly seen on breast, buttocks, abdomen and thighs. 4. Other rare side effects: These include diarrhoea, alopecia, urticaria, dermatitis, abdominal cramps and anorexia.Drug Interactions 1. Warfarin /H11003 cholestyramine: Cholestyramine is a bile acid-binding resin. It binds to and reduces the absorption of warfarin from the gut, thus decreases the  bioavailability of warfarin and its anticoagulant effect. 2. Oral anticoagulants /H11003 barbiturates/carbamazepine/rifampicin: They are enzyme inducers, increase metabolic clearance of oral anticoagulants and decrease the  anticoagulant effect. 3. Warfarin /H11003 oral contraceptives: The levels of clotting factors increase leading to decreased anticoagulant effect.

292PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES 4. Warfarin /H11003 phenytoin/sulphonamides: Warfarin is highly protein bound. These drugs displace warfarin from plasma protein binding site, increase the free plasma concentration of warfarin, which can result in bleeding (enhanced anticoagulant effect). 5. Warfarin /H11003 erythromycin/metronidazole: They decrease metabolic clearance of warfarin and increase the anticoagulant effect. 6. Warfarin /H11003 tetracyclines: T etracyclines suppress the bacterial ﬂora and decrease vitamin K production, hence potentiate warfarin effect. 7. Warfarin /H11003 cefoperazone/ceftriaxone: Severe bleeding can occur due to hypopro-thrombinaemia. 8. Warfarin /H11003 aspirin and other NSAIDs: NSAIDs have an antiplatelet effect and displace warfarin from the plasma protein binding site, thus potentiate warfarin effect.Factors Affecting Warfarin ActionI Liver disease and hyperthyroidism result in decreased levels of clotting factors – enhance anticoagulant effect of warfarin.I Excessive intake of vitamin K and hereditary warfarin resistance decrease antico-agulant effect of warfarin.Contraindications.  The contraindications for warfarin are similar to heparin. In addition, warfarin is contraindicated in pregnancy.Oral Direct Thrombin InhibitorDabigatran Etexilate.  It is a prodrug that is converted to dabigatran. It causes revers-ible inhibition of thrombin. Its anticoagulant effect is reversed by i.v. idarucizumab.Factor Xa InhibitorsRivaroxaban and Apixaban.  They are orally effective direct inhibitors of factor Xa.Use. Dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban are approved for prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Advantages over warfarin include faster onset and shorter duration of action, lower incidence of bleeding, less drug interactions and no  requirement for laboratory monitoringAdverse effects. Bleeding can occur but risk is lowTherapeutic Uses of AnticoagulantsThe main aim of anticoagulant therapy is to prevent formation of intravascular throm-bus or further extension of the already formed clot. They do not break the clot or thrombus once it is formed. An oral anticoagulant, warfarin, is used for maintenance therapy but is usually started simultaneously as it has a delayed onset of action. 1. V enous thromboembolism (VTE): V e n o u s  t h r o m b i  a r e  m a i n l y  f o r m e d  o f  ﬁbrin network with a long tail that can easily detach and result in embolization  of pulmonary arteries. Anticoagulants are used for the treatment and prevention  of thromboembolism. Treatment is initiated with parenteral anticoagulants, e.g. LMWH/UFH/fondaparinux (because of their rapid action). LMWH/fondaparinux are preferred over UFH as they are administered subcutaneously, have better bioavailability, are longer acting and usually do not require laboratory monitor-ing. For patients with VTE and coexisting severe renal disease, UFH is preferred. It is also indicated in patients who require anticoagulation but have a high risk of bleeding (postsurgery) due to its short lasting effect and reversibility with protamine. Warfarin is also started simultaneously with parenteral anticoagulant. 

2938—DRUGS AFFECTING COAGULATION AND BLOOD FORMATIONLMWH/fondaparinux/UFH is continued for about 4–5 days till effect of  warfarin is obtained. Dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban can be used for prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary thromboembolism following orthopaedic surgery like knee and hip replacement. 2. Atrial ﬁbrillation: Oral anticoagulants, e.g. warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban are used to reduce the risk of systemic embolization and stroke in patients with atrial ﬁbrillation. 3. Myocardial infarction (MI): Antiplatelets are the primary agents used in MI. In patients undergoing stenting, a short course of parenteral anticoagulants is administered. 4. Anticoagulants, e.g. vitamin K antagonists (along with low-dose aspirin) are useful in patients with prosthetic valves to prevent thrombosis.Summary of mechanism of action of anticoagulantsAnticoagulantMechanism of actionClotting factors affectedHeparin (parenteral)Activates AT III and forms heparin–AT III complexInactivates factors IIa, IXa, Xa, XIa, XIIa, XIIIaLMWH (parenteral)LMWH–AT III complexInactivates factor XaFondaparinux (parenteral)Fondaparinux–AT III  complexInactivates factor XaBivalirudin, argatroban  (parenteral)Direct inhibitors of  thrombinThrombinDabigatran (oral)Direct inhibitor of thrombinThrombinRivaroxaban, apixaban (oral)Direct inhibition of XaXaWarfarin (oral)Inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductaseInhibits synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, XAT III, antithrombin III; LMWH, low-molecular-weight heparin.FIBRINOLYTICS (THROMBOLYTICS)  PH1.25In response to stimuli (injury, stasis), tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is released from vascular endothelium. It binds to ﬁbrin-bound plasminogen and converts it  to plasmin which degrades ﬁbrin. Fibrinolytics are drugs that lyse thrombi rapidly by promoting conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. Plasmin degrades ﬁbrin and rapidly dissolves the blood clot (Fig. 8.3).Streptokinase, urokinase, alteplase, reteplase and tenecteplase are plasminogen  activators (Table 8.2). Reteplase and tenecteplase are obtained from DNA recombinant technology. They have longer plasma half-life than alteplase. T enecteplase requires only a single i.v. bolus injection and is more speciﬁc for ﬁbrin-bound plasminogen.Uses of Fibrinolytics 1. Acute MI: The main aim of ﬁbrinolytic therapy is to restore coronary artery patency. They are used as alternatives when reperfusion with PCI cannot be done. These drugs dissolve the clot by promoting the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. They should be administered as early as possible once diagnosis  is made. Early administration will help to decrease infarct size, improve left ventricular function and decrease mortality. Thrombolytic therapy is most  effective if they are administered within 1 hour of onset of symptoms. As time

These include recent trauma, recent surgery, recent abortion, re-cent stroke, severe hypertension, severe diabetes, severe liver damage, peptic ulcer and bleeding disorders.

It is administered orally or intravenously. It is used mainly to control bleeding due to overdose of ﬁbrinolytics. Thrombosis can occur.Tranexamic Acid.  It is more potent than EACA. It is available for oral, i.v. and topical administration. It is used to control excessive bleeding due to ﬁbrinolytic overdose, fol-lowing dental extraction in haemophiliacs, menorrhagia, etc. Its side effects are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, etc.Antiplatelet Drugs (Fig. 8.4)  PH1.25Drugs that inhibit platelet aggregation are called antiplatelet drugs.Classiﬁcation 1. Thromboxane (TXA2) synthesis inhibitor: Low-dose aspirin. 2. Phosphodiesterase inhibitor: Dipyridamole. 3. Purinergic (P2Y12) receptor antagonists: Ticlopidine, clopidogrel, prasugrel, cangrelor, ticagrelor. 4. Glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists: Abciximab, eptiﬁbatide, tiroﬁban.TXA2 Synthesis Inhibitor.  Low-dose aspirin (50–325 mg/day) irreversibly acetylates platelet COX-1 and reduces the production of TXA2. Since platelets cannot synthesize new enzymes, the antiplatelet effect lasts for the lifetime of the platelets, i.e. 7–10 days. In higher doses, aspirin inhibits both TXA2 and PGI2, hence antiplatelet efﬁcacy is reduced. Common adverse effects are gastric irritation and bleeding.Phosphodiesterase Inhibitor.  Dipyridamole is a vasodilator. It inhibits phosphodiester-ase and increases the concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels which inhibits platelet aggregation. It is occasionally used in combination with warfarin during postoperative period in patients with prosthetic heart valves.P2Y12 Receptor Antagonists. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) released from platelets pro-motes their aggregation (Fig. 8.4)Ticlopidine, clopidogrel and prasugrel are prodrugs and structurally related. They inhibit ADP-mediated platelet aggregation by irreversibly blocking purinergic (P2Y12) receptors on the platelets. The antiplatelet effect persists even after discontinuation of the drugs. They produce synergistic effect when combined with aspirin or GP IIb/IIIa antagonists. They are administered orally. Prasugrel has a faster onset of action and  better antiplatelet effect than ticlopidine and clopidogrel. Bleeding is an important  adverse effect; risk is more with prasugrel. The other adverse effect of ticlopidine and clopidogrel is diarrhoea. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are serious adverse effects of ticlopidine but rare with clopidogrel.Ticagrelor inhibits ADP-mediated platelet aggregation by reversibly blocking platelet P2Y12 receptors. It is rapid acting and more potent. It is administered orally. Nausea, dyspnoea, arrhythmias and bleeding are some of its adverse effects.

Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Receptor Antagonists.  Activation of GP IIb/IIIa receptors on plate-lets favours binding of ﬁbrinogen to these receptors resulting in platelet aggregation (Fig. 8.4) Abciximab, eptiﬁbatide and tiroﬁban block GP IIb/IIIa receptors on platelet surface to inhibit ﬁnal step of platelet aggregation. Abciximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to GP IIb/IIIa receptor. Eptiﬁbatide is a synthetic drug, which is more speciﬁc for GP IIb/IIIa receptor. Tiroﬁban is a nonpeptide GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist. They are useful as adjunctive therapy in high risk patients with acute coronary syndrome undergo-ing PCI. The main side effects of these drugs are bleeding and thrombocytopenia.Thrombin Receptor Antagonist.Vorapaxar blocks protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) on the surface of platelets, thus produces antiplatelet effect. It is used as an adjunct with aspirin/clopidogrel in patients with MI and peripheral vascular disease. Bleeding is the main side effect.Uses of Antiplatelet Agents 1. Acute coronary syndrome: It includes acute MI and unstable angina. Dual antiplatelet therapy is used – incidence of MI, stroke and mortality is reduced. It decreases occurrence of reocclusion and reduces risk of stent thrombosis. Aspirin in combination with other antiplatelet is used. Patients with unstable angina/NSTEMI should receive low-dose aspirin with P2Y12 blocker (ticagrelor/prasugrel/clopidogrel). In patients with STEMI, the antiplatelet to be used in addition to  aspirin depends on reperfusion therapy – primary PCI or ﬁbrinolytics. Aspirin with clopidogrel is used in patients with STEMI treated with ﬁbrinolytics. Aspirin with ticagrelor/prasugrel is preferred in those patients undergoing primary PCI. If no reperfusion therapy is given, then ticagrelor is preferred. For patients at risk of recurrent ischaemic episodes, GP IIb/IIIa antagonist can be added to antiplatelet therapy. 2. Coronary artery disease: Studies have shown that low-dose aspirin reduces the occurrence of subsequent MI, stroke and death in post-MI patients. Clopidogrel can be used as an alternative if aspirin cannot be used. 3. Prosthetic heart valves: Valve thrombosis and thromboembolism are problems associated with prosthetic valves. Aspirin with warfarin reduces these risks.  Dipyridamole may be used with warfarin to prevent thromboembolism in  patients with prosthetic heart valves. 4. Transient ischaemic attack (TIA): Early initiation of aspirin in patients with TIA reduces risk of recurrent attacks. 5. Peripheral artery disease: Aspirin/clopidogrel may prevent thromboembolism.ADP release from platelets Acts on P2Y12 receptor on platelets Conformational change in GP IIb/IIIa receptor on plateletsPromotes binding of fibrinogento GP IIb/IIIa receptor on plateletsPlatelet aggregationFig. 8.4 Mechanism of platelet aggregation by adenosine diphosphate (ADP).

2978—DRUGS AFFECTING COAGULATION AND BLOOD FORMATIONHaematinics and Haematopoietic Growth Factors  PH1.35HaematinicsHaematinics, such as iron, vitamin B12, folic acid, etc. are essential for the formation of blood. They are used in the treatment of anaemia. In anaemia, there is decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of blood due to reduction in blood haemoglobin (Hb) level and num-ber of circulating RBCs. Anaemia results from deﬁciency of nutrients (iron, vitamin B12, folic acid), depression of bone marrow (due to cytotoxic drugs, radiation, etc.), blood loss (e.g. hookworm infestation, GI bleeding, etc.) and RBC destruction.Iron.  Iron is an essential element of the body. The important sources are liver, ﬁsh, dry fruits, jaggery, spinach, banana, meat, etc. Iron is a component of haemoglobin (Hb),  myoglobin and a number of enzymes necessary for oxygen transfer (cytochrome,  catalases, etc.). The total amount of iron in an adult male is about 4 g.Pharmacokinetics.  Dietary iron exists in ferric form, which is reduced to ferrous iron with the help of acid in the stomach (Fig. 8.5). Absorption of most of the iron takes place in the duodenum and upper jejunum. Iron absorption is regulated by a protein, apoferritin, in the intestinal mucosal cells. Ferrous iron is oxidized in mucosal cells to ferric iron and this combines with apoferritin to form ferritin. From ferritin, iron is very slowly released, so iron (as ferritin) will be in the mucosal cells for a long time.The ferrous iron in plasma is oxidized again to ferric iron. This ferric iron gets bound to transferrin (transport protein). This is taken up by various tissues like reticulocytes in the bone marrow (Hb synthesis), reticuloendothelial cells in liver, spleen, etc. and stored. Small amount of iron is excreted from the body mainly by shedding of GI  mucosal cells, desquamated skin, very little in the bile, sweat and least in urine.Factors Affecting Iron Absorption.  Iron absorption is enhanced by acidic pH of the stomach, ascorbic acid, cysteine, etc., which reduce the ferric iron to ferrous form.

Iron absorption is inhibited by excess of phosphates, oxalates, phytates, etc. Milk, antacids and tetracyclines reduce iron absorp-tion by forming insoluble complexes. Absorption of oral iron is more in empty stomach.Preparations of IronOral Preparations. Oral administration of iron is convenient for the patient. The amount of elemental iron in each compound is important. Various preparations are as follows: 1. Ferrous sulphate contains 20% (hydrated salt) and 32% (dried salt) elemental iron. It is the oldest and cheapest iron preparation. 2. Ferrous fumarate contains 33% elemental iron. 3. Ferrous gluconate contains 12% elemental iron.Other oral preparations are ferrous succinate, iron choline citrate, ferric ammonium citrate, colloidal ferric hydroxide (50% elemental iron), carbonyl iron (highly puriﬁed metallic iron), etc.Adverse effects of oral iron are nausea, vomiting, epigastric discomfort, dyspepsia, metallic taste, constipation or diarrhoea and staining of teeth (with liquid preparation).Parenteral Preparations 1. Iron sorbitol citric acid complex: It is given intramuscularly, but never intravenously. 2. Iron dextran: It can be administered intravenously or intramuscularly. 3. Newer formulations like ferrous sucrose, ferric carboxymaltose, iron isomalto-side and ferumoxytol are administered intravenously. Hypersensitivity reactions are less frequent as compared to older formulations of parenteral iron.Indications for Parenteral Iron Therapy 1. Intolerance to oral iron 2. Malabsorption of iron 3. Noncompliance to oral iron 4. Severe iron deﬁciency 5. Patients with renal disease receiving erythropoietinThe total dose of iron (including amount required to replenish the stores) is calcu-lated using the formulaIronrequirement(mg)4.4bodyweight(/H11005/H11003kkg)Hbdeficit(g/dL)(NormalHb:inmen/H11003/H11005/H11005/H1100514–16g%;women12–14g%) 1. Intramuscular therapy: The preparations used areI Iron dextran complexI Iron sorbitol–citric acid complexThe recommended adult dose is 100 mg daily (2 mL) or on alternate days until the total required dose is administered or to a maximum of 2 g. T o prevent staining of the skin, injections are given deep intramuscularly into the but-tock using ‘Z-track’ technique (pull the skin and underlying subcutaneous tissue at the site of injection to one side before injecting the drug). 2. Intravenous therapy: The preparations used areIron dextran (low molecular weight): It can be administered as a total dose infusion. The total dose required is diluted in 500 mL of normal saline and infused slowly intravenously over 6–8 hours, after administering a test dose, under constant supervision. It can also be given intravenously slowly in small doses of 2 mL daily.

2998—DRUGS AFFECTING COAGULATION AND BLOOD FORMATIONFerrous sucrose: It is administered as multiple infusions. It is useful in patients with chronic kidney disease.Ferric carboxymaltose: It is an iron hydroxide complex with iron bound to a carbohydrate. It is administered as i.v. infusion.Iron isomaltoside: It consists of tightly bound iron. There is slow release of labile-free iron from this preparation. Since it is administered as single i.v. infusion, it is convenient for patients.Ferumoxytol: It has superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles coated with carbohydrate. It is indicated for use in anaemia of chronic kidney disease.Adverse Effects. The i.m. injections are painful, may cause abscess and discolouration of the skin at the site of injection. The systemic side effects following administration by i.m./i.v. routes are headache, pyrexia, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy, urticaria and circulatory collapse. Anaphylactoid reaction can occur. All patients should be moni-tored when receiving i.v. infusion of iron preparation Facilities for resuscitation should be available. Hypersensitivity reactions are more frequent with older than newer formulations.Therapeutic Uses of Iron 1. T o treat iron-deﬁciency anaemia (microcytic hypochromic anaemia) a. During pregnancy b. Due to blood loss c. Due to nutritional iron deﬁciency d. Due to poor absorption of iron from the gutMost of the patients can be treated with oral iron. For treatment of iron-deﬁciency anaemia, 200 mg of elemental iron is required per day. Ferrous sulphate is the most commonly used preparation 200 mg of ferrous sulphate (60 mg elemental iron) is given thrice daily after food (to minimize gastric irritation). There is a feeling of well-being within few days of therapy. Treatment should be contin-ued till the Hb level returns to normal (usually 4–8 weeks), and later, iron should be continued for at least 3–6 months to replenish iron storage. The  expected rise in Hb concentration after iron therapy is 0.7–1 g/dL/week.  Initially, the rate of Hb increase is rapid but later it is slow. Response to paren-teral iron is not faster than oral iron but iron stores are more quickly ﬁlled up. 2. Prophylaxis: Prophylactic iron therapy is usually indicated during pregnancy and infancy. Iron is required prophylactically to meet the increased demand by the growing fetus and uterus and to combat loss during labour. For prophylaxis,  100 mg of elemental iron is administered daily starting from second trimester. Folic acid 0.5 mg/day is given from the ﬁrst trimester to prevent neural tube  defects. Treatment of megaloblastic anaemia with vitamin B12/folic acid results in a brisk haematologic response. If iron stores are inadequate, increased demands of iron cannot be met. So, iron must be supplemented in such patients.Acute Iron Poisoning.  It is seen frequently in young children. The manifestations are nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, bloody diarrhoea, dehydration, cyanosis, drowsi-ness, hyperventilation, metabolic acidosis, convulsions, coma and death.Treatment 1. General measures 2. Speciﬁc therapyGeneral Measures.  Supportive measures: Airway, breathing, circulation, ﬂuid and electrolyte balance should be maintained.

300PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESVomiting can be induced to remove iron from the stomach. Gastric lavage with  sodium bicarbonate precipitates iron and reduces its absorption. Diazepam i.v. slowly  to control convulsions.Speciﬁc Therapy.  Desferrioxamine (deferoxamine), a potent iron chelating agent, is administered by i.v. infusion or intramuscularly depending on the severity of poisoning. It binds with iron in the blood and facilitates its excretion. Deferiprone, an oral iron chelator, is less effective than desferrioxamine in acute poisoning. Calcium edetate is also useful in iron poisoning.Maturation FactorsMaturation factors are vitamin B12 and folic acid. Both vitamin B12 and folate are essential for DNA synthesis. The deﬁciency of one or both results in defective DNA synthesis and megaloblastic anaemia.Vitamin B12.  Vitamin B12 is a cobalt-containing compound which is synthesized by the colonic bacteria and is present in the food of animal origin, such as meat, liver, egg, ﬁsh, etc. Vitamin B12 is essential for normal haemopoiesis and maintenance of normal myelin.Functions.  Vitamin B12 acts as a coenzyme in certain metabolic pathways. Methylco-balamin (methyl B12) and deoxyadenosylcobalamin (DAB12) are the coenzyme forms of vitamin B12. Methylcobalamin is necessary for the conversion of homocysteine to me-thionine, whereas for the conversion of methylmalonyl CoA to succinyl CoA, DAB12 is required.Pharmacokinetics. The ingested vitamin B12 complexes with intrinsic factor (IF) in the stomach, which is secreted by gastric parietal cells. The vitamin B12–IF complex reaches terminal ileum, where it binds to speciﬁc receptors and vitamin B12 gets absorbed into blood. In blood, vitamin B12 is bound to transcobalamin-II and is trans-ported to various cells of the body. Excess vitamin B12 is transported to liver for storage. Vitamin B12 is excreted in bile and undergoes enterohepatic cycling.Deﬁciency of vitamin B12 can be due to pernicious anaemia, malabsorption, ﬁsh tapeworm infestation, increased demand and rarely, inadequate intake.Manifestations of vitamin B12 deficiencyHaemopoietic:Megaloblastic anaemia,pallor of the skin andmucous membraneGlossitis, atrophy of tongue andvaginaNeurological:Subacute combineddegeneration of bothposterior (ataxia) andlateral (spastic paralysis)columns of spinal cord;paraesthesia, peripheralneuropathy, confusion,loss of memory,hallucination andpsychosisPreparations.  Cyanocobalamin (oral, i.m. or s.c.), hydroxocobalamin (i.m.) and methylcobalamin (oral). Vitamin B12 is available for oral and parenteral administration (never intravenously because of risk of anaphylaxis). The choice of a route depends on 

3018—DRUGS AFFECTING COAGULATION AND BLOOD FORMATIONthe cause of deﬁciency. As hydroxocobalamin is more plasma protein bound, it produces a sustained effect. But, in some patients antibodies may be formed against protein– vitamin B12 complex resulting in a decrease in its levels.Uses.  Pernicious anaemia: It is due to autoimmune destruction of the gastric parietal cells that synthesize IF. Vitamin B12 is administered lifelong. Response is seen within 24–48 hours of start of treatment. There is a sense of well-being, appetite improves. Reticulocytes increase after 2 days; increase in Hb levels occurs later. Neurological signs present for few months will disappear but those of long duration may not subside.  Administration of folic acid alone in vitamin B12 deﬁciency may correct the megaloblas-tic anaemia but will aggravate or precipitate neurological abnormalities. This is due to utilization of small quantities of vitamin B12 present in the body for haemopoiesis.Other uses. Prophylactic therapy with vitamin B12 is indicated in patients at high risk of developing deﬁciency, e.g. patients who have undergone gastrectomy.Oral methylcobalamin has been used in the treatment of diabetic and other neu-ropathies. In tobacco amblyopia, weekly injection of hydroxocobalamin is administered as it binds to cyanide.Folic Acid.  Folic acid is a combination of glutamic acid, para-aminobenzoic acid and pteridine nucleus. It is abundantly found in fresh green leafy vegetables, liver, yeast, kidney, fruits, etc. Much of it is destroyed by cooking. Minimum daily requirement of an adult is 50–100 mcg. The requirement of folic acid increases during pregnancy and lactation, i.e. 500–800 mcg/day.Pharmacokinetics. Most of the dietary folic acid is found as polyglutamates, but these are not absorbed unless they are cleaved to monoglutamate by the action of intestinal enzyme folate conjugase. It is readily absorbed in the proximal part of the jejunum. In the mucosa of the jejunum, it is reduced to tetrahydrofolate and then gets methylated. In blood, it is transported to various tissues as methyl tetrahydrofolate (MTHF). Constant supply of MTHF is maintained by food intake and enterohepatic cycling. Folate is stored mainly in liver. The stores are exhausted in about 3–4 months, hence the manifestations of folate deﬁciency appear in about 3–4 months.Folic acid itself is inactive. Its active form, tetrahydrofolate, is essential for the  biosynthesis of amino acids, purines, pyrimidines, choline, DNA and therefore in cell division.Causes of Folate Deﬁciency 1. Dietary deﬁciency: most common. 2. Decreased absorption (malabsorption, tropical sprue). 3. Diminished storage (hepatic disease, vitamin C deﬁciency). 4. Drug induced (phenytoin, antifolates, e.g. methotrexate, trimethoprim, pyrimethamine). 5. Increased demand (pregnancy, lactation, haemolytic anaemias).Manifestations of Folate Deﬁciency 1. Megaloblastic anaemia – microscopically the blood picture is similar in both folate and vitamin B12 deﬁciency. 2. Glossitis, diarrhoea, general weakness and weight loss.Preparations.  Folic acid is available for oral (tablet and liquid) and parenteral administration (combination with other vitamins or iron).Folinic acid (calcium leucovorin) is used in the treatment of methotrexate toxicity and as an adjuvant in methanol poisoning.

302PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESUses 1. Megaloblastic anaemias due to nutritional folate deﬁciency, increased demand (pregnancy and lactation), pernicious anaemia (along with vitamin B12) and antiepileptic therapy (e.g. phenytoin).Folic acid is given orally in a dose of 1–5 mg daily and continued for about 3–4 months.Administration of folic acid alone in vitamin B12 deﬁciency may correct the megaloblastic anaemia but will aggravate or precipitate neurological abnormalities. This results from use of small quantities of vitamin B12 present in the body for haemopoiesis. 2. Prophylactic therapy: During pregnancy, routine prophylactic folic acid 0.5 mg/day is given from the ﬁrst trimester to prevent neural tube defects. 3. Methotrexate toxicity: Folinic acid, active form of folic acid, is used to antagonize methotrexate toxicity. 4. T o increase the anticancer effect of 5-ﬂuorouracil, folinic acid is coadministered with it.Adverse Effects.  Oral folic acid is safe, but injections may rarely cause hypersensitivity reactions.Haematopoietic Growth FactorsThey stimulate growth and differentiation of blood cells. They include erythropoietin,  myeloid and thrombopoietic growth factors (Table 8.3). They are usually administered parenterally.Erythropoietin.  Erythropoietin is produced by peritubular interstitial cells of the kidney in response to hypoxia. Erythropoietin stimulates erythropoiesis by acting on  the erythropoietic stem cells in bone marrow.Commercially, erythropoietin is produced by recombinant DNA technology. It is admin-istered by i.v. or s.c. route. The preparations available are epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa.Uses. Erythropoietin is used in anaemia associated with renal failure, anticancer drugs, zidovudine-induced anaemia in HIV patients, etc.Adverse Effects. These include rise in blood pressure, haematocrit and thromboem-bolic complications. Rarely, allergic reactions also may occur. Flu-like symptoms, nausea, vomiting and tachycardia can occur with epoetinDrugFunctionUsesMyeloid growth factors, e.g. human granulocyte colony stimu-lating factor (G-CSF): ﬁlgrastim; human granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF): sargramostimStimulate proliferation and differentiation  of WBCsPatients whose WBCs are suppressed  by anticancer or  antiretroviral drugsThrombopoietic growth factors, e.g. interleukin-11 (oprelvekin) and re-combinant thrombopoietinStimulate production  of plateletsTo treat cancer  chemotherapy- induced thrombo-cytopeniaTable 8.3  Functions and uses of myeloid and thrombopoietic growth factors  PH1.35

Functions of Growth Hormone.  It has growth-promoting effect; produces anabolic effect on muscle. It maintains positive nitrogen balance; promotes utilization of fat.Clinical Disorders of Growth Hormone (Fig. 9.2)Uses.  Recombinant human GH (somatropin and somatrem) is available for paren-teral administration. It is used to treatI Growth hormone deﬁciency in children and adults. Following early initiation of treatment with GH in children, stature can be almost normal. In adults, body fat is reduced.I AIDS-related wasting.Mecasermin is a recombinant human IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1). It is administered parenterally to promote growth in children with IGF deﬁciency not  responding to GH. The adverse effects are hypoglycaemia (can be avoided by giving the drug after food) and lipodystrophy.Somatostatin.  It is a peptide hormone secreted by pancreas and parts of the central nervous system (CNS) in addition to hypothalamus. Somatostatin inhibits release of growth hormone, glucagon, insulin and gastrin. Other actions include constriction of hepatic, splanchnic and renal blood vessels. It has a very short half-life (1–3 minutes). Hence, its synthetic analogue octreotide is preferred for therapeutic use.Octreotide.  It is more potent and longer acting than somatostatin. Unlike somatostatin, it mainly inhibits growth hormone secretion. It can be administered subcutaneously and intravenously.Uses of Octreotide 1. Acromegaly. 2. Symptomatic treatment of various hormone-secreting tumours, e.g. carcinoid syndrome. 3. Diarrhoea associated with diabetes. 4. Acute control of bleeding from oesophageal varices. It constricts hepatic blood vessels and decreases variceal bleeding.The common side effects of octreotide are nausea, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps.Lanreotide.

306PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESDrugs Used to Treat Acromegaly 1. Somatostatin analogues: Octreotide is used to treat acromegaly when surgery and irradiation are contraindicated. It acts by inhibiting synthesis and release of growth hormone. Lanreotide can also be used. 2. Dopamine-receptor agonists: Dopamine agonists like bromocriptine and cabergoline stimulate the secretion of GH in normal subjects but paradoxically decrease GH secretion in patients with acromegaly. Hence, they can be used to treat acromegaly when patients are unwilling to take regular injection. 3. Pegvisomant (GH-receptor antagonist): It is used subcutaneously to treat acromegaly in patients not responding to somatostatin analogues.Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone.  Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is now rarely used to diagnose thyroid disorders as very sensitive assays for thyrotropin and thyroid hormones are now available.Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone.  Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimu-lates release of ACTH from anterior pituitary. CRH is used only for diagnosis of hyper-corticism to distinguish between Cushing disease and ectopic ACTH secretion.Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone.  Pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion stimulates gonadotroph cells in the anterior pituitary to synthesize and release LH and FSH. Sustained nonpulsatile administration of GnRH or its analogues can be used for initial stimulation and later suppression of gonadal hormone secretion.Gonadotropins (Gns)Follicle-Stimulating Hormone.  The functions of FSH areIn females–development of ovarian follicles–ovarian steroidogenesisIn males–regulation of spermatogenesis–conversion of testosterone to oestrogen in Sertoli cells.Preparations of FSHUrofollitropin – obtained from urine of postmenopausal womenFollitropin alfa and follitropin beta – recombinant forms of FSHLuteinizing Hormone.  The functions of LH areIn females–ovarian steroidogenesis–ovulationIn males–testosterone production by Leydig cellsPreparations of LH.  Lutropin, recombinant form of LH, is available for use.Human Chorionic Gonadotropin.  It is secreted by placenta – helps to maintain corpus luteum of pregnancy. It exerts its actions through LH receptors. Human chorionic gonado-tropin (hCG) puriﬁed from urine and a recombinant form of hCG are available for use.Uses of FSH, LH and hCGI For controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in assisted reproduction technology.I Stimulation of spermatogenesis in hypogonadal infertile males.Adverse Effects of FSH, LH and hCG.

Prolactin.  Prolactin is a peptide hormone secreted by anterior pituitary. It is also known as mammotropin or lactogenic hormone.Control of prolactin secretion is mainly inhibitory unlike other anterior pituitary hormones (Fig. 9.3). Dopamine, secreted by hypothalamus, inhibits prolactin secretion. Thus, dopamine agonists (bromocriptine, cabergoline) inhibit prolactin secretion whereas dopamine antagonists (e.g. chlorpromazine, haloperidol, metoclopramide) cause increase in prolactin levels.Hyperprolactinaemia.  This is a relatively common condition resulting from hypotha-lamic or pituitary disorders. The common causes are prolactin-secreting pituitary  adenomas and dopamine antagonists. For prolactin-secreting tumours, treatment  options are surgery, irradiation and drugs. Postoperatively, most of the patients require treatment with dopamine-receptor agonists. These drugs decrease both prolactin secre-tion and size of adenoma.Dopamine-Receptor Agonists.  Bromocriptine is the prototype of ergot-derived dopa-mine agonist. Other ergot derivatives used to treat hyperprolactinaemia are pergolide and cabergoline.Bromocriptine.  It is a semisynthetic ergot derivative acting as a potent dopamine agonist (mainly at D2-receptors). As dopamine is a neurotransmitter at different sites in the brain, it produces various motor, behavioural and endocrine effects.Pharmacological Actions 1. Endocrine: (a) Dopamine (prolactin release–inhibiting hormone, PRIH) is the main factor controlling prolactin secretion. Bromocriptine, a dopamine agonist, effec-tively reduces the secretion of prolactin. (b) Bromocriptine increases GH level in normal individuals, but in patients with acromegaly, it acts paradoxically to reduce GH levels.PRH PRIH (dopamine)Anterior pituitarySucklingHypothalamus

Nausea and vomiting may occur with bromocriptine due to stimulation of dopamine receptors in chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ). 4. It may cause hypotension due to /H9251-adrenergic blockade.Pharmacokinetics.  Bromocriptine is partly absorbed after oral administration, undergoes ﬁrst-pass metabolism extensively and metabolites are excreted in bile.Uses.  It is useful in hyperprolactinaemia, acromegaly, parkinsonism and restless leg syndrome.Adverse Effects 1. Gastrointestinal tract (GIT): Nausea, vomiting and constipation 2 .  Cardiovascular system (CVS): Postural hypotension – due to /H9251-adrenergic blockade 3. CNS: Hallucinations, confusion and psychosisCabergoline.  It is more potent and longer acting than bromocriptine. It is the pre-ferred drug for hyperprolactinaemia. It is also useful in acromegaly.Thyroid and Antithyroid Drugs  PH1.36The hormones secreted by the thyroid gland are thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3) and calcitonin. The thyroid follicular cells have specialized mechanism for synthesis of thyroid hormones. This is regulated by TSH secreted by anterior pituitary, which, in turn, is inhibited by free thyroid hormone levels (Fig. 9.4). The ‘C’ cells of thyroid secrete calcitonin which is a functionally distinct hormone regulating calcium metabolism.The deﬁciency of thyroid hormones in children results in cretinism characterized by mental retardation and other features of hypothyroidism (Table 9.1); in adults, it results in myxoedema. Hypersecretion of these hormones also has effects on various organ systems resulting in ‘thyrotoxicosis’ .HypothalamusAnterior pituitaryThyroid glandTRH    TSHSynthesis and releaseT4 and T3Fig. 9.4 Control of thyroid hormone synthesis and release.

SYNTHESIS OF THYROID HORMONES 1. Iodide trapping: Active transport of iodide ions (I/H11002) into follicular cells of thyroid gland is known as iodide trapping and takes place by a basement membrane pro-tein called sodium/iodide symporter. 2. Oxidation and iodination: The iodide ion is oxidized to iodine by peroxidase enzyme. Iodine combines with tyrosine residues of thyroglobulin molecule and forms monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT). 3. Coupling: This is the ﬁnal step in the synthesis of thyroid hormones and is cata-lysed by thyroid peroxidase. Two molecules of DIT couple to form thyroxine (T4) and one molecule of MIT with one molecule of DIT forms triiodothyronine (T3).MIT /H11001 DIT n T3; DIT /H11001 DIT n T4

3119—ENDOCRINE PHARMACOLOGY 4. Hormone release: Release of thyroid hormones takes place under the control of TSH. The process involves endocytosis and proteolysis of iodinated thyroglobulin and results in release of T4, T3, MIT and DIT. 5. Peripheral conversion of T4 to T3: Most of the hormone released from thyroid is T4, which is less potent than T3. Conversion of T4 to T3 occurs mainly in liver and kidney. Peripheral conversion of T4 to T3 is inhibited by propylthiouracil, iopanoic acid, propranolol and glucocorticoids.Differences between T3 and T4T3 (Triiodothyronine)T4 (Thyroxine)Formed by DIT /H11001 MIT /H11005 T3Formed by DIT /H11001 DIT /H11005 T4Relatively rapid onset of actionSlower onset of actionShort duration of action (half-life: 1 day)Long duration of action (half-life: 7 days)More potent than T4Less potentUseful to treat myxoedema comaUsed to treat myxoedema coma and for regular treatment of myxoedemaMechanism of Action.  Mechanism of action of thyroid hormones is similar to that of steroid hormones.

Combination of T4 and T3 (4:1): tabletsTherapeutic Uses.  Replacement therapy in hypothyroid states 1 .  Cretinism and myxoedema: For cretinism, treatment of newborn should be started as early as possible after birth to ensure normal growth and cognitive development. Replacement in elderly and patients with coronary artery disease should be started with low dose of levothyroxine sodium such as 12.5–25 mcg daily and slowly increased to prevent precipitation of ischaemia and myocar-dial infarction. In young adults with hypothyroidism, full replacement doses of levothyroxine sodium can be administered (50–100 mcg daily as a single dose orally in the morning on an empty stomach). The goal of therapy is to relieve symptoms and restore serum TSH to normal levels; treatment is for lifetime.

(b) Intravenous hydrocortisone (c) Correction of hypothermia by warming the patient (d) Correction of electrolyte imbalance, e.g. hyponatraemia (e) Ventilatory support may be required (f) Antibiotics, if infection is the precipitating cause 3. Benign thyroid nodule – some cases, therapy with T4 suppresses TSH levels. 4 .  Thyroid carcinoma – thyroid hormone suppression therapy is used in papillary carci-noma of thyroid to suppress TSH and prevent its stimulation of growth of tumour.ANTITHYROID DRUGS (Fig. 9.5)These drugs reduce the level of thyroid hormones by reducing thyroid hormone synthe-sis or release or both. These drugs play an important role in the management of hyper-thyroidism caused by both benign and malignant conditions of thyroid gland.Classiﬁcation 1. Thyroid hormone synthesis inhibitors (thioamide derivatives): Propylthiouracil, methimazole, carbimazole 2. Inhibitors of iodide trapping (anion inhibitors): Thiocyanates, perchlorates 3. Hormone release inhibitors: Iodine, organic iodide, iodides of Na/H11001 and K/H11001 4. Thyroid tissue destroying agent: Radioactive iodine (131I) 5. Others: Propranolol, atenolol, diltiazem, dexamethasoneThioamides (Thiourea Derivatives)Propylthiouracil, methimazole and carbimazole are thioamides used to treat hyperthy-roidism. Important features of propylthiouracil and carbimazole are given on p. 313.Mechanism of Action of Thioamides (Fig. 9.5).  Thioamides act by inhibiting 1. Thyroid peroxidase enzyme, which converts iodide to iodine 2. Iodination of tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin 3. Coupling of iodotyrosines (MIT and DIT)Propylthiouracil also inhibits the peripheral deiodination of T4 to T3. Other thioamides do not have this action.Pharmacokinetics.  Thioamides are well absorbed orally. Propylthiouracil is most rap-idly absorbed. Carbimazole is converted to methimazole after absorption. They are widely distributed but get accumulated in thyroid gland. Propylthiouracil has a short half-life and needs to be given every 6–8 hours. They are excreted in urine. They cross placental barrier and can cause fetal hypothyroidism. Both propylthiouracil and carbimazole/methimazole

Propylthiouracil is preferred to carbimazole/methimazole for treatment of hyperthyroidism during ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy.Adverse Effects.  Skin rashes are most common. The other side effects are joint pain, fever, hepatitis, nephritis, etc. A dangerous but rare adverse effect is agranulocytosis, which usually occurs during ﬁrst few weeks or months of therapy but may occur later also. This may develop rapidly, so regular blood counts may not be helpful. The drugs should be stopped at the ﬁrst sign of agranulocytosis, i.e. sore throat and/or fever. Hepa-totoxicity can occur with propylthiouracil. Hypothyroidism may occur but it is reversible.Important features of Propylthiouracil and CarbimazolePropylthiouracilCarbimazoleLess potentMore potentHighly bound to plasma proteinsLess protein boundHas short duration of action (4–8 hours)Has longer duration of action (12–24 hours)Inhibits peripheral conversion  of T4 to T3Negligible actionNo active metaboliteGets converted to methimazole which is activePassage across placenta is lowPassage across placenta is lowLevels in breast milk are lowLevels in breast milk are low

314PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESUses 1. For long-term treatment of hyperthyroidism due to Graves disease/toxic nodular goitre where surgery is not indicated or not feasible and radioactive iodine is  contraindicated. Carbimazole/methimazole is preferred for long-term treatment as it is long acting and is not hepatotoxic. 2. Preoperatively in thyrotoxic patients before subtotal thyroidectomy – carbimazole is used to achieve euthyroidism. 3. Along with radioactive iodine: Radioactive iodine has a slow onset of action. Hence, carbimazole is also administered for initial control of hyperthyroidism in those patients treated with radioactive iodine. 4. For treatment of thyrotoxic crisis, propylthiouracil is used along with iodide and propranolol.Anion InhibitorsThiocyanates, perchlorates and other anions block uptake of iodide by thyroid, but  are highly toxic and have unpredictable effects. For these reasons, they are not used clinically.Iodine and IodidesIodides are the oldest agents used to treat hyperthyroidism. They are the most rapid acting antithyroid drugs. They have a paradoxical effect on thyroid hormone synthesis when given in therapeutic doses. Although the exact mechanism of action is not com-pletely explained, high concentration of iodide appears to inhibit almost all steps in the synthesis of thyroid hormones. But the major mechanism is inhibition of hormone  release (thyroid constipation). High level of intracellular iodide rapidly inhibits iodin-ation of tyrosine residues and hormone synthesis (Wolff–Chaikoff effect) which is tran-sient; later, thyroid escape occurs.Preparations and Uses 1. Lugol’s iodine (5% iodine in 10% solution of KI). 2. Ipodate sodium and iopanoic acidThe above preparations of iodine (1 and 2) are used orally preoperatively before thyroidectomy and in thyroid storm. They render the gland ﬁrm, less vascular and decrease its size, which makes surgery convenient with less bleeding and complications. 3. As an expectorant: Potassium iodide (KI) acts as a mucolytic agent that enhances expectoration. 4. As an antiseptic: Tincture of iodine (iodine in alcohol). 5. Prophylaxis of endemic goitre: Iodized salt is used.Adverse Effects.  Allergic reactions: Angioedema, laryngeal oedema, arthralgia, fever, eosinophilia and lymphadenopathy may occur acutely (type III hypersensitivity).Chronic overdose with iodide results in iodism. The symptoms are headache, sneez-ing and irritation of eyes with swelling of eyelids; sometimes pulmonary oedema can occur. These resolve after few days of stopping iodine.Hypothyroidism may also occur.Use of iodides during pregnancy may cause fetal goitre.Radioactive IodineTherapeutically used radioactive iodine is 131I (half-life: 8 days). Sodium iodide 123I (half-life: 13 hours) is used for diagnostic scan.

3159—ENDOCRINE PHARMACOLOGYIt gets concentrated in the same way as stable iodine in thyroid and emits /H9253-rays and /H9252-particles. The /H9252-particles cause destruction of follicular cells leading to ﬁbrosis and correction of hyperthyroid state.Preparation.  131I is used orally as solution or capsule. The dose is expressed in microcurie.Uses and Contraindications.  Radioactive iodine is used for treatment of hyperthyroid-ism due to toxic nodular goitre/Graves disease specially in elderly and patients with  coexisting cardiac disease. It is also useful in hyperthyroidism due to adenoma or carcinoma when surgery is not feasible or contraindicated. It is contraindicated in pregnancy, children and nursing mothers.Advantages 1. Treatment is simple; does not require hospitalization – can be done in outpatient department 2. Low cost 3. No risk of surgery and scar 4. Permanently cures hyperthyroidismDisadvantages.  It is slow acting and causes local soreness in the neck. Incidence of hypothyroidism is high. It is not suitable for pregnant women, children and young patients./H9252-Adrenoceptor Blockers (/H9252-Blockers)Propranolol, atenolol and metoprolol can be used. They produce dramatic improve-ment in symptoms of thyrotoxicosis like tachycardia, palpitation and tremors.  Propranolol also has an inhibitory effect on peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.Uses 1. T o control symptoms of thyrotoxicosis initially till antithyroid drugs act 2. In thyrotoxic crisis 3. Preoperatively before thyroid surgeryThyrotoxic Crisis (Thyroid Storm)This is a manifestation of severe hypermetabolic state due to very high levels of circulating thyroid hormones. Besides the usual features of hyperthyroidism, this is characterized by hyperpyrexia, cardiac arrhythmias (e.g. atrial ﬁbrillation), nausea, vomiting, diar-rhoea and mental confusion. It is usually precipitated by infection, trauma, surgery (thyroid or nonthyroid), diabetic ketoacidosis, myocardial infarction, etc.Treatment 1. Hospitalization. 2. Supportive care: Cooling blankets, hydration, sedation and antibiotics to treat infection. 3. Propranolol, 1–2 mg i.v. slowly every 4 hours; then, oral propranolol 40–80 mg every 6 hours. It controls palpitations, tremors, tachycardia and inhibits peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. 4. Propylthiouracil is administered via nasogastric tube. 5. Sodium ipodate, 0.5 g orally, is administered orally. It inhibits release of thyroid hormones and peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. 6. Diltiazem can be used if propranolol is contraindicated. 7. Intravenous hydrocortisone 100 mg i.v. every 8 hours – inhibits peripheral conver-sion of T4 to T3; also corrects adrenal insufﬁciency, if present.

316PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESSex Hormones and Their Antagonists  PH1.37ANDROGENST estosterone is the main androgen in men. It is synthesized by Leydig cells (interstitial cells) of the testes under the inﬂuence of interstitial cell-stimulating hormone, ICSH (LH) of anterior pituitary. FSH is responsible for spermatogenesis (Fig. 9.6).Classiﬁcation 1. Natural androgens: T estosterone, dihydrotestosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione. 2. Synthetic androgensI Methyltestosterone, ﬂuoxymesterone – given orally; slowly metabolized; longer acting than testosterone.I Esters of testosterone in the form of cypionate (i.m.), propionate (i.m.), enanthate (i.m.) and undecanoate (oral, i.m.) are slowly absorbed from site of administration.Actions of Te s to s te ro n e (Natural Androgen).  T estosterone has both androgenic and anabolic actions. T estosterone and dihydrotestosterone are responsible for the development of male secondary sexual characteristics, maturation of reproductive organs (androgenic action), increase in mass and strength of skeletal muscle (anabolic action) and erythropoiesis.Pharmacokinetics.

Cholestatic jaundice mainly with methyltestosterone.Therapeutic Uses 1. Androgens are mainly used in replacement therapy in males with hypogonadism due to testicular failure, hypopituitarism, etc. Transdermal/parenteral prepara-tions of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone are commonly used – maintains  serum testosterone levels within normal range. 2. In HIV patients with low testosterone levels, administration of testosterone increases muscle mass and strength. 3. Osteoporosis in elderly males.Precautions and Contraindications 1. Pregnancy: Androgens should not be used during pregnancy because of fear of virilization of female fetus. 2. Carcinoma of prostate and breast cancer in men. 3. Renal and cardiac diseases.Anabolic Steroids (Synthetic Androgens)Anabolic steroids promote protein synthesis and increase muscle mass, resulting in weight gain. They are synthetic androgens with greater anabolic and lesser androgenic activity. T estosterone has potent anabolic effect, but it cannot be used because of its strong androgenic effect. The ratio, anabolic to androgenic activity with testosterone, is 1. Some of the commonly used anabolic steroids are Nandrolone phenylpropionate (i.m.), Nandrolone decanoate (i.m.), Oxandrolone (oral), Stanozolol (oral), Ethylestrenol (oral), Methandienone (oral, i.m.).Mnemonic.  NOSE.Uses 1. In chronic illness, to improve appetite and feeling of well-being. 2. During recovery from prolonged illness, surgery, burns, trauma or chronic debili-tating diseases. 3. In senile osteoporosis, though they are not the drugs of choice.Adverse Effects and Contraindications.  Adverse effects and contraindications are the same as androgens. Anabolic steroids are often misused by athletes to increase muscle strength and athletic performance, hence are included in ‘dope test’ .DanazolI Weak androgenic, glucocorticoid and progestational activitiesI Suppresses FSH and LH surge; inhibits gonadal functionI Useful orally in endometriosis and ﬁbrocystic breast diseaseI Hot ﬂushes, amenorrhoea, hirsutism and muscle cramps may occurI Other adverse effects are GI side effects and hepatotoxicityI Contraindicated in pregnancyANTIANDROGENS 1.

 3 .  Androgen-receptor antagonists: Flutamide, bicalutamide, cyproterone, spironolactone. 4. 5/H9251-reductase inhibitors: Finasteride, dutasteride.The mechanism of action of antiandrogens is shown in Fig. 9.7.I Oestrogens decrease androgen levels by inhibiting gonadotrophin secretion.I Ketoconazole is an antifungal agent that inhibits adrenal and gonadal steroid synthesis.I Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist that inhibits testosterone synthesis; it is also a competitive blocker of androgen receptors. The side effects are hyperka-laemia, gynaecomastia and menstrual irregularities.I Cyproterone acetate and ﬂutamide competitively block androgen receptors. They block the action of androgens on the target cell. These drugs are used to treat carci-noma of prostate, hirsutism in females and acne in both sexes. Adverse effects are impotence, hot ﬂushes, gynaecomastia, hepatic damage, decreased spermatogenesis and gastrointestinal (GI) side effects such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Bicalu-tamide (oral) is more potent, longer acting and better tolerated than ﬂutamide.I Finasteride and dutasteride block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotes-tosterone by inhibiting 5/H9251-reductase enzyme. Dutasteride is slow acting but has long duration of action. Given orally, they decrease serum and prostatic dihy-drotestosterone levels. Dihydrotestosterone is more active and is responsible for most of the actions of androgens in many tissues. These drugs decrease the size of prostate and improve urinary ﬂow rate. They are less effective when compared to surgery and /H92511-blockers in the treatment of BPH. Combined use of ﬁnasteride and /H92511-adrenergic blockers results in better effect. Prolonged treatment is necessary to sustain beneﬁt. Stoppage of the drug results in regrowth of the prostate. They are also useful in male pattern baldness. The side effects of ﬁnasteride are impotence, skin rashes, itching and decreased libido.OestrogensOestrogens are naturally occurring sex hormones produced by ovary, adrenal gland and placenta. 1.

Therapeutic Uses of Oestrogens (Fig. 9.10) 1. Oral contraceptive: The most common use of synthetic oestrogens is for contra-ception, often in combination with a progestin (for details, see p. 326).OestrogensProgestinsHelp in the growth and development of  sex organs in females; they stimulate the development of secondary sex charactersImportant for the maintenance of  pregnancyResponsible for the proliferative phase of  endometrium and have negative feed-back control mainly on anterior pituitaryResponsible for secretory phase of the endometrium and have negative feedback control on both hypothalamus and anterior pituitaryPromote rhythmic contractions of fallopian tubes and myometriumDecrease tubal motility and uterine contractionsCervical secretion becomes thin, watery and alkaline, which facilitates entry of  spermatozoaCervical mucus becomes thick, more viscous and acidic, which is hostile  to sperm penetrationStimulate the growth of ducts and stroma  in breastStimulate proliferation of acini in breastMetabolic actions: Oestrogens decrease the rate of resorption of bone by inhibiting the activity of osteoclasts; they increase plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL)  and decrease LDL levels; they cause  sodium–water retention and oedema  (mineralocorticoid activity)Metabolic actions: Long-term use of progestins may decrease glucose  tolerance; progestins increase  circulating LDL levels; they stimulate  lipoprotein lipase activity and favour  fat deposition; they also produce  sodium and water retentionThey enhance coagulability of blood by  increasing the clotting factors (II, VII, IX  and X) and decreasing antithrombin IIIThey increase body temperatureThey induce synthesis of progesterone  receptorsThey inhibit the synthesis of oestrogen  receptorsTable 9.2   Actions of oestrogens and progestins

The metabolites are excreted in urine and bile. In the intestine, they undergo deconjugation with the help of bacterial ﬂora and are reabsorbed resulting in enterohepatic cycling.Actions of Oestrogens and Progestins are described in Table 9.2.

3219—ENDOCRINE PHARMACOLOGY 2. Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy: The signs and symptoms in postmenopausal women are due to cessation of normal ovarian function. They are vasomotor symptoms, sleep disturbances, genital atrophy and osteoporosis lead-ing to fractures. The incidence of cardiovascular disease is more in postmeno-pausal women.Short-term oestrogen therapy is used to relieve menopausal symptoms such as hot ﬂushes, night sweats, depression, irritability and sleeplessness. The main objective of long-term oestrogen therapy in postmenopausal women is to prevent or delay osteoporosis (oestrogens decrease the rate of resorption of bone by inhibiting the activity of osteoclasts) and atherosclerosis (oestrogens increase plasma HDL and decrease LDL levels). Hormone replacement ther-apy (HRT) reduces the incidence of coronary artery disease and Alzheimer disease. To avoid the risk of endometrial and breast cancer, a progestin  (medroxyprogesterone or norethisterone) is given for the last 12–14 days of each month. Oestrogen alone is used in hysterectomized women. The most effective oestrogens in preventing osteoporosis are conjugated oestrogens (sulphate esters of natural oestrogens – oral preparation). Transdermal  oestradiol patch can be used – systemic side effects are less.Drawbacks of HRT: Increased incidence of venous thromboembolism and gall-stones, uterine bleeding, mood changes, breast cancer, etc. 3. Senile vaginitis: T opical oestrogens are commonly used. 4 .  Dysmenorrhoea: Oestrogens in combination with progestins can be used to suppress ovulation in patient with dysmenorrhoea. (The anovulatory cycles are painless.) 5. Delayed puberty in girls: In patients suffering from Turner syndrome and hypopituitarism, oestrogens are used for the development of secondary sexual characteristics and to avoid osteoporosis. Usually cyclic treatment is given. 6. Carcinoma of prostate: Oestrogens are palliative. Fosfestrol is a prodrug of oestrogen, which is concentrated in the prostate and gets activated to stilboes-trol by acid phosphatase in prostatic tissue. GnRH agonists are preferred to oestrogens.Tibolone has oestrogenic, progestogenic and weak androgenic activities and does not cause endometrial proliferation. It can be used continuously for HRT without cyclic progesterone.Adverse Effects of Oestrogens They are nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness, water retention with oedema and weight gain, increased incidence of endometrial and breast cancer, thromboembolic complica-tions, increased incidence of gallstones and liver disease. The dose of oestrogen used in HRT is low (approximately one-ﬁfth of oral contraceptive dose), hence the side effects are less severe.Antioestrogens and Selective Oestrogen-Receptor ModulatorsAntioestrogens compete with natural oestrogens for receptors in target organs. They include clomiphene citrate and fulvestrant.

322PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESCLOMIPHENE CITRATE  PH1.40 It is a nonsteroidal compound and has antioestrogenic effect.Mechanism of Action

It has a long plasma half-life due to high plasma protein binding and accumulation in fatty tissues.Uses 1. Infertility: Clomiphene citrate is used for the treatment of infertility due to anovulation. Cyclical therapy is recommended. Clomiphene should not be used for more than six cycles because of risk of ovarian cancer. Schedule of clomiphene therapy is given below.Menstrual cycle1228 daysFrom second day 50 mg o.d. /H11003 5 days 2.

It is used for prevention and treatment of osteopo-rosis in postmenopausal women. The adverse effects are hot ﬂushes, leg cramps,  increased incidence of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. It does not  increase the risk of endometrial cancer.ORMELOXIFENEOrmeloxifene, a selective oestrogen-receptor modulator, has antagonistic effect  on breast and uterus. It is useful for the treatment of dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Adverse effects include headache, weight gain and nausea.AROMATASE INHIBITORSI Exemestane (steroidal agent) causes irreversible inhibition; letrozole and anastro-zole (nonsteroidal agents) cause reversible inhibition of aromatase. They are administered orally.I They decrease oestrogen levels by inhibiting aromatase enzyme – useful in breast carcinoma; hot ﬂushes are common adverse effects.I Unlike tamoxifen, there is no endometrial hyperplasia, venous thromboembolism, and unfavourable effect on lipid proﬁle. But it causes bone loss. It should not be administered to premenopausal women.Aromatase• L e t r o z o l e• A n a s t r o z o l e• Exemestane/H17054EstradiolT estosteroneProgestinsNatural progestin, progesterone, is secreted by corpus luteum of the ovary in the second half of the menstrual cycle, and by placenta during pregnancy.

PHARMACOKINETICS Progesterone is not effective orally because of extensive ﬁrst-pass metabolism. It is usu-ally given by i.m. route in oil base. Micronized progesterone and synthetic progestin preparations are effective orally.USESProgestins are commonly used for contraception and HRT of postmenopausal women (Fig. 9.11). 1. Contraception: Progestins are used in contraception as combined pill (oestrogen-progestogen), minipill, postcoital pill, injectable preparations, implants and intra-uterine contraceptive devices. For details, see under contraceptives (see p. 326). 2. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding: Oral progestins (norethisterone or norethyno-drel) are used. A high initial dose is used to arrest bleeding after which mainte-nance dose is given for 20 days. Withdrawal bleeding occurs in 2–5 days after stoppage of therapy. The cyclic treatment can be continued for 3–6 months. 3. Endometriosis: The classical symptoms are dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia, menor-rhagia and infertility. Continuous long-term treatment with oral progestins causes regression of the lesion by inducing anovulatory cycles. 4. HRT in postmenopausal women: Progestins are combined with oestrogens for long-term HRT in women with an intact uterus to prevent endometrial prolifera-tion and subsequent carcinoma. 5. Endometrial carcinoma: They are used in advanced metastatic endometrial carcinoma. 6 .  Postponement of periods: Either progestins or combined oral contraceptive pills should be started 3 days before the expected period and continued till required time as needed. The withdrawal bleeding occurs within 72 hours after stoppage of the drug.Life span of femaleMenarche•  Contraception•  Dysfunctional    uterine bleeding•  Endometriosis•  Postponement of     periodsMenopause•  HRT (adjuvant)•  Carcinoma    endometriumFig. 9.11 Uses of progestins.

326PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESADVERSE EFFECTS The adverse effects are acne, ﬂuid retention, weight gain, depression, irregular periods, hirsutism, increase in blood glucose levels (levonorgestrel) and increased risk of breast cancer on prolonged use. The older progestins cause altered plasma lipid levels; hence, there is an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. The newer progestins have little or no adverse effect on lipid levels.AntiprogestinMifepristone is a competitive antagonist of progesterone and has luteolytic property. It also has antiglucocorticoid and antiandrogenic activities. Mifepristone is orally effective, has long plasma half-life, metabolized in liver, excreted in bile and undergoes enterohepatic cycling.USES 1. Termination of pregnancy: Mifepristone is used in combination with prostaglan-dins (PGs) for termination of early pregnancy. A single oral dose of 600 mg of mifepristone, followed 48 hours later by gemeprost (PGE1) 1 mg vaginal pessary, raises the success rate to 95%. 2. Contraception: It has been used as a postcoital contraceptive. It causes sloughing and shedding of decidua and brings about abortion. 3. Used for the induction of labour in cases of intrauterine fetal death. 4. For cervical ripening before abortion or induction of labour. 5. Hypercortisolism: It has antiglucocorticoid activity, hence useful in Cushing syndrome.ADVERSE EFFECTSThese are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, headache, uterine bleeding and teratogenicity.Hormonal Contraceptives  PH1.39Hormonal contraception (Fig. 9.12) is one of the most effective contraceptive methods available today. Progestin (norethynodrel) was used in the ﬁrst contraceptive trial by Pincus and his colleagues in 1950s.ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES (Table 9.4, P . 327)They include combined pills, minipills and postcoital pills.Combined Oestrogen and Progestin Preparations (Combined Pill)The combined oral contraceptive pill is widely used; it is the most effective reversible method of contraception.In combined pillI Oestrogen used: ethinyl oestradiol.I Commonly used progestins: Norethindrone, levonorgestrel, norgestimate, norg-estrel, desogestrel and gestodene.

In addition, progestins inhibit oestrogen-induced endometrial proliferation n decrease risk of endometrial carcinoma.I Each pill (monophasic) taken throughout the treatment period has a ﬁxed amount of oestrogen and progestin.I In biphasic preparation, the dose of oestrogen is kept constant but progestogen varies according to the phase of the menstrual cycle. In triphasic preparation, the dose of oestrogen is slightly more in mid-cycle but doses of progestin increase in three successive phases of menstrual cycle.The oestrogen content of pills usually ranges from 20 to 30 mcg and the progestin content from 0.1 to 1 mg in monophasic pills. Preparations containing less than 30 mcg of oestrogen are referred to as ‘low-dose’ pills. The progestins namely desogestrel,  gestodene and norgestimate are ‘lipid friendly’ , as they increase HDL level and reduce atherogenic risk. They have potent antiovulatory effect.

Mechanism of Action of Combined Contraceptive Pill.  The following are the mechanism of action of contraceptives (Fig. 9.13). The numerals 1, 2, 3 and 4 shown in the ﬁgure are described in the following ways: 1. Both oestrogen and progestin act synergistically on hypothalamic–pituitary axis by negative feedback mechanism and inhibit the release of FSH and LH, which leads to inhibition of ovulation. 2. Cause tubal and uterine contractions that may interfere with fertilization. 3. Make the endometrium less suitable for implantation. 4. Thick, viscid cervical mucus secretion prevents sperm penetration (progestins).Schedule for Use of Combined Pill.  The schedule for use of combined pill is shown in Fig. 9.14.The combined oral contraceptive pill is usually started from ﬁrst day of menstrual cycle (i.e. the day bleeding starts) and continued till day 21. Days 22–28 is oral contra-ceptive pill–free period (7 days). The next day (i.e. after day 28) is taken as day 1 and the course of the combined pill repeated as above till required period of contraception.The combined pill can also be started from ﬁfth day of menstrual cycle, continued for 21 days followed by a gap of 7 days, following which it is continued again.If a woman on combined oral contraceptive pills fails to take a tablet, she should take two tablets the next day and continue rest of the pills as prescribed. If she misses more than two tablets, she should stop the treatment, use alternate method of contraception and restart course of pills from next cycle.Contraindications of Combined Oral Contraceptives.  Absolute contraindications include thromboembolic disorders, malignancy of genital tract, severe hypertension, cardiac diseases, porphyria and active liver disease.Relative contraindications are obesity, diabetes, migraine, mild hypertension, uterine ﬁbroid, etc.Ovary1234

It may be used in women if oestrogens are contraindicated. The schedule for use of minipill is shown in Fig. 9.15.Mechanism of Action of Minipill.  It acts by altering cervical mucus, interfering with implantation and inhibiting ovulation. It may cause menstrual irregularities and there is increased risk of ectopic pregnancy.Postcoital Pill (Emergency Contraception)It interferes with implantation and also has antiovulatory effect. Drugs that can be used for postcoital contraception are levonorgestrel, ulipristal and mifepristone. They are mainly used following rape, unprotected intercourse or accidental rupture of condom during coitus. (a) Levonorgestrel tablet 0.75 mg (two doses, Fig. 9.16): Oral administration of levonorgestrel is effective, if taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse (morning after pill).Levonorgestrel (0.75 mg)One pill (as early as possible within 72 hours)Levonorgestrel (0.75 mg)One pill 12 hours laterFig. 9.16 Schedule for the use of postcoital contraceptive.Note: Levonorgestrel 1.5 mg can be taken as a single dose within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. (b) Mifepristone (antiprogestin) 600 mg as a single dose can be used as postcoital pill. (c) Ulipristal (selective progesterone-receptor modulator, SPRM) 30 mg as a single dose is effective up to 5 days following unprotected sex. It has antiovulatory effect and can block implantation. It may cause headache.Beneﬁcial Effects of ContraceptivesI Unwanted pregnancy is avoided.Noncontraceptive Beneﬁcial EffectsI Relieve dysmenorrhoea and premenstrual tension.I Prevent iron-deﬁciency anaemia by reducing menstrual loss.I Reduce incidence of pelvic inﬂammatory disease and endometriosis.I Protect against ovarian and endometrial carcinoma.I Reduce incidence of benign breast tumours and ovarian cysts.PARENTERAL CONTRACEPTIVESInjectable Contraceptives 1. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA): 150 mg deep i.m. once in 3 months. 2. Norethindrone enanthate (NET-EN): 200 mg i.m. once in 2 months.

330PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESAdvantages 1. Regular oral medication is avoided, so patient compliance is better. 2. Can be used safely during lactation. 3. Decreased risk of endometrial cancer on prolonged administration.Disadvantages.  Injectable contraceptives cause menstrual irregularities, headache, mood changes, weight gain, osteoporosis, decrease in HDL and increase in LDL levels. Return of fertility after stoppage is usually delayed for several months (6–8 months).ImplantsNorplant.  It is a subdermal implant which consists of six ﬂexible rods containing 216 mg of levonorgestrel. The contraceptive effect lasts for 5 years but fertility is restored almost immediately on removal. Implants may be associated with infection, local irrita-tion and pain at the insertion site. The other side effects are headache, mood changes, weight gain and acne.Implanon.  It is a subdermal single rod containing 68 mg of desogestrel. The contracep-tive effect lasts for 3 years.DEVICESIntrauterine devices: (a) Levonorgestrel device: It is a ‘T’-shaped device inserted into the uterine cavity and the contraceptive effect lasts for 5 years. (b) Progestasert: Intrauterine device containing progestogen can be inserted into the uterine cavity. The efﬁcacy is low and the device has to be replaced yearly.ADVERSE EFFECTS OF HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVESMost of the side effects with combined oral pills are dose related. The current low-dose preparations have minimal side effects. 1. Nausea, vomiting, headache, breakthrough bleeding, which occurs initially during therapy but subside following continuous use. 2. Weight gain, ﬂuid retention, acne and pigmentation of skin occur later. 3. Impaired glucose tolerance and alteration in lipid proﬁle was observed with high-dose contraceptives and is rare with low dose, newer preparations. 4. Blood pressure may increase following long-term use. It is less common with low-dose preparations. 5. Long-term adverse effects include increased incidence of venous thromboembolic disease especially in women with risk factors for thromboembolism like smoking; risk of myocardial infarction and stroke in women with coexisting diabetes or hypertension. 6 .  Increased risk of gallstones, benign liver tumours and breast cancer on prolonged use.DRUG INTERACTIONS Rifampin, phenytoin and carbamazepine induce hepatic microsomal enzyme system, enhance metabolism of oral contraceptives and can cause failure of contraception. Hence, when the woman is on rifampin, phenytoin, etc., alternative forms of contracep-tion should be used.

3319—ENDOCRINE PHARMACOLOGYOral contraceptives /H11003 tetracyclines/ampicillin. Oestrogens are conjugated in liver and excreted via bile into the gut, where they are decon-jugated by bacterial ﬂora and then reabsorbed. Antibiotics (tetracyclines, ampicillin) are incompletely absorbed in the gut, so they destroy the bacteria, therefore, reduce deconju-gation and reabsorption of oral contraceptives, leading to contraceptive failure.Nonsteroidal ContraceptiveCentchroman (ormeloxifene): It is a synthetic nonsteroidal contraceptive and has oestro-gen antagonistic effect. It is taken orally twice weekly for 12 weeks, and weekly thereafter. It prevents implantation through endometrial changes. The return of fertility occurs within 6 months of stoppage of the drug. It has no teratogenic, carcinogenic or muta-genic effects. It has a long plasma half-life.MALE CONTRACEPTIVESSome of the drugs tried as male contraceptives are oestrogens, progestins, androgens, antiandrogens, GnRH analogues, gossypol, etc.; but the results are not satisfactory.Corticosteroids  PH1.38Adrenal gland has cortex and medulla. Adrenal cortex secretes steroidal hormones; ad-renal medulla secretes adrenaline and noradrenaline. Hormones of adrenal cortex are given in Table 9.5.Synthesis and release of glucocorticoids is controlled by pituitary ACTH, which in turn is stimulated by corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) produced by hypothalamus. Glucocorticoids have negative feedback control on ACTH and CRF secretion (Fig. 9.17).Mineralocorticoid (e.g. aldosterone) release is controlled by the renin–angiotensin system.

336PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESElectrolyte and Water Metabolism Glucocorticoids have weak mineralocorticoid action, cause sodium and water retention; promote potassium excretion. Thus, prolonged use of these drugs may cause oedema and hypertension. Some of the synthetic glucocorticoids (dexamethasone, betametha-sone and triamcinolone) have no sodium- and water-retaining property.Calcium Metabolism (Anti-Vitamin D Action)Prolonged use of these drugs may lead to osteoporosis and pathological fracture of verte-bral bodies.Inhibit calcium absorption from the gutIncrease renal excretion of calcium Glucocorticoids↓↓Blood Ca level2/H11001 BoneGlucocorticoidsOsteoblasts (bone forming cells)Osteoclasts (bone resorption cells)CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEMGlucocorticoids have sodium and water retaining property; exert a permissive effect on pressor action of adrenaline and angiotensin.

Weakness  occurs in both hypocorticism and hypercorticism.Hypocorticism: due to inadequate circulation Muscle weakness and fatigue Hypercorticism: due to hypokalaemiaininProlonged use of glucocorticoids may cause muscle wasting and weakness (steroid myopathy).CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEMCorticosteroids have a number of indirect effects on CNS through maintenance of  (i) blood pressure, (ii) blood glucose concentration and (iii) electrolyte levels.They also have direct effects on CNS and influence mood and behaviour.  Patients with Addison disease show depression, irritability and even psychosis. On the other hand, glucocorticoid therapy can cause euphoria, insomnia, restlessness and psychosis.

This is due to redistribution of cells. They have a marked lympholytic action, therefore are used in lymphomas and leukaemias.ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECT They have powerful anti-inﬂammatory and immunosuppressant effects. They prevent or suppress the clinical features of inﬂammation such as redness, heat, pain and swell-ing. At tissue level, they suppress the early phenomena (capillary permeability, oedema, cellular inﬁltration and phagocytosis) and late responses like capillary proliferation,  collagen deposition, ﬁbroblast activity and scar formation.Membrane phospholipidsArachidonic acidCyclooxygenase LipoxygenasePGsLTsPhospholipase A2   Lipocortin/H11002Glucocorticoids
 1. Glucocorticoids induce a protein called lipocortin which inhibits phospholipase A2; hence, PGs, leukotrienes (LTs) and PAF are not formed. 2. Production of cytokines like IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-/H9251 necessary for initiating inﬂam-mation is inhibited. 3. Chemotaxis is suppressed. 4. Glucocorticoids stabilize lysosomal membrane and prevent release of inﬂammatory mediators. 5. Glucocorticoids inhibit expression of various adhesion molecules on endothelial cells, thus inhibiting leucocyte migration to site of injury.IMMUNOSUPPRESSANT EFFECTImmune responseT lymphocytesB lymphocytesLymphokinesImmunoglobulinsCell-mediated immunityHumoral immunity

338PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESGlucocorticoids have immunosuppressant effect. They inhibit both B-cell and T-cell lymphocyte functions and this results in impairment of humoral and cell-mediated im-munity. Cell-mediated responses are suppressed indirectly by inhibiting the production of cytokines, including TNF-/H9251 and interleukins. They also suppress all types of hyper-sensitivity or allergic reactions.ADVERSE REACTIONSA single dose of glucocorticoids is practically harmless, rather they are life-saving drugs in conditions like anaphylactic shock and acute adrenal insufﬁciency. The use of glucocorti-coids in supraphysiological doses for more than 2–3 weeks causes a number of undesirable effects. Most of the adverse effects are extension of their pharmacological actions. 1. Metabolic effects: Hyperglycaemia, or aggravation of pre-existing diabetes. 2. Cushing’s habitus: Abnormal fat distribution causes peculiar features with moon face, buffalo hump and thin limbs. 3. GIT: Peptic ulceration, sometimes with haemorrhage or perforation. 4. Salt and water retention: Mineralocorticoid effect may cause oedema, hypertension and even precipitation of CCF, particularly in patients with primary hyperaldoste-ronism. This can be minimized by using synthetic steroids like dexamethasone and betamethasone. 5. Muscle: Steroid treatment can cause hypokalaemia leading to muscle weakness and fatigability. Long-term steroid therapy leads to steroid myopathy. 6. Bone: Osteoporosis with pathological fractures of vertebral bodies is common. Ischaemic necrosis of femoral head can also occur. 7. Growth retardation in children is more common with dexamethasone and betamethasone. 8. Eye: Glaucoma and cataract may occur on prolonged therapy. 9. CNS: Behavioural disturbances like nervousness, insomnia, mood changes and even psychosis may be precipitated. 10. Long-term therapy with steroids leads to immunosuppression, which makes the patient vulnerable to opportunistic infections like fungal (candidiasis, cryp-tococcosis), viral (herpes, viral hepatitis) and bacterial (reactivation of latent tuberculosis). Inhalational steroids can cause local irritation and fungal infection of upper respiratory tract, which can be prevented by the use of spacer and by rinsing the mouth after inhalation. 1 1 . Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis suppression: The most dangerous side effect of long-term steroid therapy is HPA axis suppression. Long-term use of corticosteroids in large doses will decrease ACTH secretion through negative feedback effect on hypothalamus and pituitary and gradually cause adrenal cortical atrophy. Hence, abrupt stoppage of glucocorticoid therapy following prolonged use leads to:I Flaring up of the underlying disease being treated.I Withdrawal symptoms like fever, myalgia, arthralgia and malaise.I Acute adrenal insufﬁciency on exposure to stress which manifests as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hypotension, dehydration, hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia, etc.Therefore, important precautions to be taken during long-term steroid therapy to minimise HPA axis suppression are as follows: (a) Whenever possible, topical use is preferred. (b) Short- or intermediate-acting steroids (e.g. hydrocortisone, prednisolone) should be preferred.

3399—ENDOCRINE PHARMACOLOGY (c) Give steroids as a single morning dose at 8 a.m.; if the daily dose is high, ad-minister two-third of the dose in the morning and one-third in the evening, which will mimic endogenous hormone levels and minimize chances of HPA axis suppression. (d) Try alternate-day steroid therapy in chronic conditions like bronchial asthma, nephrotic syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). (e) Withdrawal of steroids after long-term (/H110222 weeks) treatment should be very slow to allow recovery of normal adrenocortical function. The doses of steroid should be tapered gradually and then stopped. It will take days/weeks or even longer for HPA axis to recover after stoppage of therapy. During this period, patient will require treatment with steroids on exposure to stress.Note: If a patient on long-term steroid therapy is exposed to stress like infections and major surgery, the dose of steroids administered should be increased to combat stress (as adrenals will fail to increase glucocorticoid secretion on  account of HPA axis suppression).THERAPEUTIC USES OF GLUCOCORTICOIDSReplacement Therapy 1. Acute adrenal insufﬁciency: It is a medical emergency. It is treated with i.v. hydro-cortisone and i.v. normal saline with 5% glucose to correct ﬂuid and electrolyte imbalance. Precipitating causes such as trauma, infection or haemorrhage should be treated. 2. Chronic adrenal insufﬁciency: Treated with oral hydrocortisone (two-third of the daily dose is given in the morning and one-third in the evening) along with adequate salt and water. 3 .  Adrenogenital syndrome and adrenal virilism: Corticosteroids are helpful. The beneﬁcial effect is due to suppression of pituitary ACTH, which in turn reduces adrenal androgens. A highly potent glucocorticoid like dexamethasone is preferred.Nonendocrine Diseases.  Corticosteroids are an important group of drugs used clinically in a variety of diseases. Because of their dramatic symptomatic relief, they are often misused. Nonendocrine diseases require supraphysiological doses of steroids. The beneﬁcial effects of glucocorticoids are mainly due to their anti-inﬂammatory and  immunosuppressant effects. They also have anti-allergic and lympholytic properties. 1. Rheumatoid arthritis: They produce an immediate and dramatic symptomatic relief in rheumatoid arthritis, but they do not halt progression of the disease. By their anti-inﬂammatory effects, they decrease the swelling, redness, pain and  improve mobility of joints. Intra-articular injection is preferred only if one or  two joints are involved. Steroid can be given as adjunct to nonsteroidal anti- inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). 2. Osteoarthritis: They are rarely used in osteoarthritis. Intra-articular injection is recommended for acute episodes involving one or two joints. 3. Rheumatic fever: Glucocorticoids produce more rapid symptomatic relief than aspirin and are indicated in cases with carditis and CCF. Prednisolone is given along with aspirin and should be continued until the ESR comes to normal; then the steroid is tapered off gradually. 4. Gout: They are reserve anti-inﬂammatory drugs in acute gout not responding to NSAIDs.

340PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES 5. Allergic diseases: The manifestations of allergic diseases, such as hay fever, reac-tions to drugs, urticaria, contact dermatitis, angioneurotic oedema and anaphy-laxis, can be suppressed by glucocorticoids, but they have slow onset of action. Hence, severe reactions such as anaphylaxis and angioneurotic oedema require immediate therapy with adrenaline. In hay fever and mild allergic reactions,  antihistamines are the preferred drugs. 6. Bronchial asthma: Glucocorticoids have anti-inﬂammatory and antiallergic effects; hence, they reduce mucosal oedema and bronchial hyperreactivity.  They help to prevent and reverse tolerance to /H92522-agonists. In acute severe asthma, i.v. hydrocortisone is given along with nebulized /H92522-agonist and ipratropium bromide. If a chronic asthmatic needs steroid, it is better to give inhalational preparations like beclomethasone, budesonide or ﬂuticasone because they cause minimal systemic adverse effects. 7. Collagen diseases: Collagen diseases such as polymyositis, polyarteritis nodosa, polymyalgia rheumatica and dermatomyositis can be controlled with large doses of glucocorticoids. Steroid with negligible salt- and water-retaining property is preferred. 8. Renal disease: Glucocorticoids are the ﬁrst-line drugs in nephrotic syndrome. 9. Ocular diseases: They are frequently used to suppress inﬂammation in the eye, thus prevent damage to vision. Agents may be administered topically, sub-conjunctivally, systemically or by retrobulbar injection, depending upon the condition. Steroids are contraindicated in herpes simplex keratitis and ocular injuries. 10. Skin diseases: Glucocorticoids dramatically relieve itching, pain and inﬂamma-tion in allergic and other dermatoses. T o minimize systemic effects, topical  steroids are preferred. Systemic steroid therapy is needed in severe conditions  like exfoliative dermatitis, dermatomyositis and pemphigus. Psoriasis, keloids and hypertrophic scar are sometimes treated by intralesional injection of  steroids. 11. Haematological disorders: Autoimmune haemolytic anaemias usually respond to glucocorticoids. Because of their lympholytic action, glucocorticoids are used to treat certain malignancies, leukaemia, lymphomas, Hodgkin disease, multiple myeloma, etc., usually in combination with antineoplastic drugs. 12. Cerebral oedema: The effectiveness of glucocorticoids in cerebral oedema depends upon the underlying cause. They are very effective when the oedema is caused by brain tumours, metastatic lesions and tubercular meningitis. They are least effective when the cerebral oedema is due to head injury.  A steroid without salt and water retaining activity (e.g. dexamethasone) is preferred. 13. Intestinal diseases: They are used in ulcerative colitis when the patient is not responding to other forms of treatment. Methylprednisolone can be adminis-tered as retention enema during acute episodes. 14. Shock: Prompt intensive treatment with i.v. glucocorticoids may be life saving in septic shock. 15. Organ transplantation: Glucocorticoids are used to prevent as well as treat graft rejection. 16. Hypercalcaemia of malignant diseases, sarcoidosis and vitamin D intoxication responds to prednisolone. 17. Other uses include Bell palsy, acute polyneuritis and myotonia. 18. Dexamethasone can be used to test the HPA function.

It is useful in adrenal carcinoma.Insulin and Oral Antidiabetic Agents  PH1.36Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a clinical syndrome characterized by hyperglycaemia due to absolute or relative deﬁciency of insulin. Lack of insulin affects the metabolism of car-bohydrate, protein and fat.Ty pe 1 DM: The aetiology is immunological or idiopathic. It appears when more than 90% of /H9252-cells of pancreas are destroyed by an autoimmune process. The peak incidence is around 15 years. In type 1 DM, there is insulin deﬁciency. Insulin is essential for all patients with type 1 DM.Ty pe 2 DM: Genetic inﬂuence is much more powerful in type 2 DM. It is the com-monest form of diabetes. Overeating, obesity, underactivity and ageing are the main risk factors. Type 2 DM is associated with increased hepatic production of glucose and resis-tance of target tissues to the action of insulin.Hormones of pancreas: There are four types of cells in islets of Langerhans: /H9252 (B)-cells secrete insulin, /H9251 (A)-cells secrete glucagon, /H9254 (D)-cells secrete somatostatin and F (PP)-cells secrete pancreatic polypeptide.C-peptideA chainSSSSB chainSSFig. 9.19 Structure of proinsulin.INSULINInsulin was discovered by Banting and Best. Insulin is synthesized by the /H9252-cells of pancre-atic islets from a single-chain polypeptide pre-cursor called preproinsulin, which is converted to proinsulin. Insulin is formed by the removal of C-peptide from proinsulin by proteolysis. Insulin consists of two peptide chains called A and B (Fig. 9.19). These two chains are con-nected by two disulphide bridges. C-peptide (connecting peptide) can produce immuno-genic reactions.Regulation of Insulin SecretionInsulin secretion is regulated by chemical, neural and hormonal mechanisms.Chemical.  Glucose, amino acids and fatty acids in the blood stimulate /H9252-cells and release insulin (Fig. 9.20). Ingestion of nutrients (carbohydrate/protein/fat) causes

Oral nutrients (including glucose) are more effective in stimulating incretin secretion as compared to their intravenous infusion.Neural.  Both parasympathetic and sympathetic ﬁbres supply the islet cells. Parasympa-thetic stimulation causes increase in insulin secretion and lowers raised blood glucose level. The islet cells have both /H9251-adrenergic and /H9252-adrenergic receptors. Adrenergic /H92522-stimulation increases insulin release and the blood glucose falls. Adrenergic /H92512-activation causes hyperglycaemia by inhibiting the release of insulin.Hormonal.  Counter-regulatory hormones like adrenaline, cortisol and glucagon promote glucose release from liver. Glucagon stimulates whereas somatostatin inhibits insulin  release (Fig 9.21).

3439—ENDOCRINE PHARMACOLOGYActions of Insulin (Fig. 9.22) Insulin has profound effects on the metabolism of carbohydrate, fat and protein. It  facilitates the entry of glucose into all cells of the body. However, entry of glucose  into RBCs, WBCs, liver and brain cells can occur independent of insulin. Exercise also facilitates entry of glucose into muscle cells without the need for insulin. 1. Insulin inhibits hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis; inhibits lipolysis in adipose tissue. 2. Insulin enhances entry of amino acids into muscles and cells – promotes protein synthesis in muscle, lipogenesis, hepatic and muscle glycogenesis. 3. Insulin also promotes peripheral utilization of glucose and K/H11001 uptake into the cells.GluconeogenesisProcesses which addglucose to the bloodProcesses which utilizeglucose from the bloodHepatic glycogenolysisAlimentary absorptionof glucoseBloodSugar/H17054/H17054

Fig. 9.23 Mechanism of action of insulin.Mechanism of Action of InsulinInsulin binds to speciﬁc receptors (tyrosine kinase receptor) present on the cell mem-brane. The receptor consists of two /H9251 and two /H9252 subunits (Fig. 9.23). The /H9251 subunits are entirely extracellular, whereas the /H9252 subunits are transmembrane proteins with tyrosine kinase activity. Binding of insulin to the /H9251 subunit activates tyrosine kinase activity of 

344PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESthe /H9252 subunits resulting in phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of the receptor. This results in a complex series of phosphorylation–dephosphorylation reactions, which promotes entry of glucose into the cell and mediates various actions of insulin.PharmacokineticsInsulin is destroyed by proteolytic enzymes in the gut, hence, not effective orally. Insulin is administered usually by subcutaneous (s.c.) route, but in emergencies, regular  (soluble) insulin is given by i.v. route. After i.v. injection, soluble insulin is rapidly  metabolized by the liver and kidney with a half-life of about 6 minutes.Insulin PreparationsConventional Insulin Preparations 1. Bovine (beef) insulin: It differs from human insulin by three amino acid residues and is antigenic to man. 2. Porcine (pig) insulin: It differs from human insulin by only one amino acid residue and is less immunogenic than bovine insulin.These preparations are antigenic as they contain pancreatic proteins, proinsulin, etc. Hence, they are not used.Monocomponent InsulinsMonocomponent insulins are puriﬁed insulins. They are less antigenic than conventional preparations, cause less insulin resistance and lipodystrophy at injection site, e.g. mono-component porcine regular insulin, monocomponent porcine isophane insulin, etc.Conventional porcine insulinMonocomponent pork insulinPuriﬁcation techniques(Puriﬁed insulins: insulin preparations with /H1102110 ppm proinsulin contamination)Human InsulinsThey are produced by recombinant DNA technology using Escherichia coli or yeast. They have the same amino acid sequence as endogenous insulin. They are least immunogenic; insulin resistance and lipodystrophy at the site of injection are rare, e.g. human regular insulin and human NPH insulin. Puriﬁed human insulins are the commonly used insulin preparations.Insulin AnaloguesThey are produced by DNA recombinant technology. The amino acid sequence is slightly different from endogenous insulin. Though actions are similar, pharmacokinetic proﬁle is altered. They are either fast and short acting or slow and long acting.Insulin Preparations Based on Onset and Duration of Action (Table 9.7)Rapidly Acting Insulin Analogues.  (Modiﬁcation in B chain), e.g. insulin lispro, insulin aspart and insulin glulisine.I They have less tendency to form hexamers (unlike regular insulin).I On s.c. administration: quickly dissociate into monomers n rapidly absorbed n rapid onset of action within 5–15 minutes; peak effect in 1 hour. They are admin-istered just before meals.I Duration of action is about 4 hours; lower risk of late postprandial hypoglycaemia.I Immunogenicity and binding to insulin receptor is similar to human regular insulin.

The main goal of insulin therapy is to maintain the fasting blood glucose concentration between 90 and 120 mg/dL and postprandial glucose level below 150 mg/dL.Concentration of InsulinInsulin preparations are available in a concentration of 100 U/mL or 40 U/mL. Regular insulin is also available in 500 U/mL. Insulin dosage is measured in units (U). All insulin preparations are administered by s.c. route. Regular insulin can be given by i.v. route in diabetic ketoacidosis to get rapid effect.Insulin RegimensVarious regimens of mixture of insulins are used for therapy. The split mixed regimen – often, a split dose of 70:30 NPH/regular insulin mixture is administered before breakfast and before dinner. Another regimen (intensive regimen) consists of administration of long-acting insulin either before breakfast or at bedtime and injection of short-acting insulin before each meal (preprandial). Intermediate- and long-acting insulins maintain basal insulin levels; preprandial insulin provides postprandial needs of insulin.Mixed Insulin PreparationsI Intermediate-acting insulin takes several hours to achieve effective plasma concen-tration. Hence, they are combined with regular insulin/rapidly acting insulin  analogues.I NPH (intermediate-acting insulin) /H11001 regular insulin. They can be mixed in the same syringe.I Stable premixed insulin mixtures are available, e.g. NPH 70% /H11001 regular insulin 30%.I Premixed preparations of NPH with insulin lispro/aspart are unstable. Hence, protamine is complexed with insulin lispro to form neutral protamine lispro (NPL) and with aspart resulting in neutral protamine aspart (NPA), which are intermediate acting like NPH insulin.Premixed combination of NPL and insulin lispro:I 75% NPL/25% insulin lispro.I 50% NPL/50% insulin lispro.Premixed combination of NPA and insulin aspart: 70% NPA/30% insulin aspart.Long-acting insulin analogues (glargine and detemir) should not be mixed with regular insulins or rapidly acting insulin analogues. They should be administered  separately.Insulin AdministrationI Insulin syringes and needles.I Pen devices: They are convenient to carry; a preset amount is delivered subcutane-ously.I Insulin pumps are available for continuous s.c. insulin infusion. Short-acting in-sulin, e.g. regular insulin is used. An advantage is that it is programmed to deliver 

3479—ENDOCRINE PHARMACOLOGYinsulin to maintain basal levels and also a bolus dose prior to meals. It is expensive and there could be mechanical problems with the pump.Indications for Insulin 1. Type 1 DM 2. Diabetic ketoacidosis 3. Nonketotic hyperglycaemic coma 4. Diabetes during pregnancy 5. Stress of surgery, infections and trauma (temporarily to tide over trauma, infec-tion, surgery, etc.) in diabetics 6. Patients with type 2 DM in addition to oral antidiabetic drugsSite of AdministrationInsulin is usually administered subcutaneously in the abdomen, buttock, anterior thigh or dorsal arm.Complications of Insulin Therapy 1. Hypoglycaemia is the most common and dangerous complication. Prolonged hypoglycaemia may cause permanent brain damage. Hypoglycaemia can occur in any diabetic and may be due to delay in taking food, too much physical activity or excess dose of insulin.Symptoms of hypoglycaemia are (a) Autonomic symptoms: They occur initially and are due to counter-regulatory sympathetic stimulation – sweating, tremor, palpitation, anxiety and tachycardia. (b) Neuroglycopenic symptoms like headache, blurred vision, confusion, loss of ﬁne motor skill and abnormal behaviour. They usually occur at lower plasma glucose levels.With further lowering of blood glucose levels, convulsions and loss of con-sciousness can occur.Treatment: All these manifestations are relieved by administration of glucose.  If the patient is conscious, oral glucose or if the hypoglycaemia is severe  (unconscious patient) 50 mL of 50% dextrose is injected intravenously.Glucagon 1 mg i.v. or adrenaline 0.2 mg s.c. may be given for severe hypoglycaemia. 2. Allergic reactions are rare; they may cause local skin reactions (swelling, redness) at the site of injection and may be due to minor contaminants. 3. Lipodystrophy (either atrophy or hypertrophy) may occur at the site of injection. It may be avoided by using puriﬁed insulin preparations and changing the injec-tion site by rotation. 4. Oedema due to salt and water retention.Insulin Resistance.  It is a state in which there is decreased response of peripheral tissues to insulin. Acute insulin resistance develops during stressful conditions  like trauma, infection, surgery and psychological stress. Dose of regular insulin should be increased.Diabetic KetoacidosisDiabetic ketoacidosis is a complication of type 1 DM. It is rare in type 2 DM. The com-mon precipitating factors are infection, trauma, severe stress, etc. The clinical features are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, polyuria, abdominal pain, hypotension, tachycardia, hyperventilation, altered consciousness or coma in untreated cases. Diabetic ketoacido-sis is a medical emergency.

348PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESManagement of Diabetic KetoacidosisI Insulin replacement: Regular insulin is administered as intravenous bolus in a dose of 0.2–0.3 U/kg followed by 0.1 U/kg/hour i.v. infusion. Blood glucose levels should decrease by 10% in the ﬁrst hour. Monitoring of blood glucose levels should be done for optimal insulin replacement. Once patient becomes conscious, insulin can be administered subcutaneously.I Fluid replacement: Initially, normal saline is infused intravenously at 1 L/h; then rate of infusion is gradually decreased depending on the requirement of the pa-tient. Once blood glucose levels fall to about 250 mg/dL, 5% glucose in ½ N saline is administered to prevent development of hypoglycaemia and cerebral oedema.I Potassium: Following insulin therapy and correction of acidosis, potassium shifts into the cells resulting in hypokalaemia. Potassium chloride 10–20 mEq/h is in-fused after 4 hours of initiation of insulin therapy. Serum potassium and ECG should be monitored to determine potassium replacement.I Sodium bicarbonate i.v. is administered if required.I Phosphate: Patients with severe hypophosphataemia require phosphate replacement.I Antibiotics to treat associated infection, if any.Hyperosmolar Nonketotic Diabetic ComaIt is a medical emergency. It is characterized by severe hyperglycaemia (in the absence of ketosis), hyperosmolality and dehydration. The general principle of treatment is same as for diabetic ketoacidosis except that the patient needs more and faster ﬂuid replace-ment. There is a high mortality rate of about 50% in spite of intensive therapy.Drug Interactions 1. /H9252-Blockers /H11003 insulin (see Fig. 2.25, p. 94). 2. Salicylates /H11003 insulin: Salicylates exert hypoglycaemic effect by increasing the sensitivity of pancreatic /H9252-cells to glucose and potentiating insulin secretion.ORAL ANTIDIABETIC DRUGS (Table 9.8) 1.

3519—ENDOCRINE PHARMACOLOGYSulphonylureas.  Sulphonylureas are divided into two generations. All these drugs have the same mechanism of action, but differ in potency and duration of action. The sec-ond-generation drugs are more potent than ﬁrst-generation drugs.Mechanism of Action 1. Sulphonylureas stimulate insulin secretion from /H9252-cells of pancreas. It is an insu-lin secretagogue.SulfonylureasBind to speciﬁc receptors on /H9252-cells of islets of pancreasBlock ATP-sensitive potassium channelsDepolarization and inﬂux of Ca2/H11001 ions into /H9252-cellsDegranulation and increased release of stored insulin from /H9252-cellsFor successful therapy with sulphonylureas, at least 30% functioning /H9252-cells are necessary. Sulphonylureas are ineffective in type 1 DM because of absence of functioning /H9252-cells in the islets of pancreas. 2. Sulphonylureas increase the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin by increas-ing the number of insulin receptors. 3. They reduce the release of glucagon.Pharmacokinetics.  Sulphonylureas are well absorbed after oral administration, highly bound to plasma proteins and have low volume of distribution. They are metabolized in liver and excreted mainly in urine.Adverse Effects 1. Hypoglycaemia is common, particularly with glibenclamide and chlorpropamide due to their long duration of action. Glibenclamide is best avoided in elderly pa-tients because of the high risk of hypoglycaemia. 2. GI disturbances like nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and ﬂatulence. 3. Weight gain is due to stimulation of appetite. 4. Allergic reactions: Skin rashes, itching and photosensitivity. 5. T eratogenicity: Sulphonylureas are not safe during pregnancy. 6 .  Chlorpropamide has disulﬁram-like action, hence, produces intolerance to alcohol.Use.  Sulphonylureas are useful in patients with type 2 DM.Drug Interactions 1. Sulphonylureas /H11003 salicylates/sulphonamides: These drugs are highly bound to plasma proteins and displace sulphonylureas from the plasma protein-binding site, resulting in an increase in free plasma concentration of sulphonylureas –  potentiate the effects of sulphonylureas (severe hypoglycaemia). 2. Propranolol /H11003 sulphonylureas: Propranolol by blocking hepatic /H92522-receptors, inhibits glycogenolysis and delays recovery from hypoglycaemia. Propranolol also masks the symptoms of sulphonylurea-induced hypoglycaemia, such as tachycar-dia and palpitation (by blocking /H92521-receptors of the heart) and tremors (by block-ing /H92522-receptors in skeletal muscle).

352PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES 3. Rifampicin, phenobarbitone /H11003 sulphonylureas: Rifampicin and phenobarbi-tone are enzyme inducers; hence, they accelerate the metabolism of sulphonyl-ureas and reduce their effects. 4. W arfarin, sulphonamides /H11003 sulphonylureas: They inhibit the metabolism of sulphonylureas, thereby, increase the plasma levels of sulphonylureas leading to severe hypoglycaemia.Biguanides.  Metformin is the only biguanide used clinically.Mechanism of Action.  The mechanism of action of biguanides is shown in Fig. 9.24.Metformin 1. It activates the enzyme AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK). This results in a. Decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis (major action). b. Increased peripheral utilization of glucose in skeletal muscle and fat resulting in glycogen storage in the skeletal muscle, increased fatty acid oxidation and decreased lipogenesis. 2. Inhibition of alimentary absorption of glucose.Biguanides do not affect insulin release; they improve tissue sensitivity to insulin.Pharmacokinetics.  Metformin is taken orally, well absorbed through GI tract and is excreted mostly unchanged in urine.Adverse Effects.  Adverse effects are metallic taste, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diar-rhoea, loss of weight and skin rashes. Lactic acidosis is the most serious complication but is rare with metformin. Prolonged use can cause vitamin B12 deﬁciency due to malabsorption. Metformin usually does not cause hypoglycaemia even in large doses.Alimentary absorptionof glucose

3539—ENDOCRINE PHARMACOLOGYUse.  Metformin is used in patients with type 2 DM either alone or in combination with other antidiabetic agents. Hypoglycaemia is rare. It protects against vascular com-plications of diabetes.Meglitinide Analogue (Repaglinide) and D-Phenylalanine Derivative (Nateglinide).  Repaglinide and nateglinide are structurally unrelated to sulphonylureas but their mechanism of action is similar to sulphonylureas. They stimulate insulin release  by closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels in /H9252-cells of islets of pancreas n depolarization n insulin release. Repaglinide and nateglinide are well absorbed from GI tract, metabolized mainly in the liver and should be avoided in patients with hepatic fail-ure. They have rapid onset but short duration of action. They are less potent than sulpho-nylureas. They are used only in type 2 DM to control postprandial hyperglycaemia.The main side effects of repaglinide are weight gain and hypoglycaemia, but the epi-sodes are less frequent; meglitinide causes nausea and ﬂu-like symptoms.Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibitors.  Sitagliptin, alogliptin and linagliptin inhibit DPP-4 competitively whereas saxagliptin and vildagliptin bind covalently with the enzyme. They inhibit the enzyme DPP-4 n prevent inactivation of GLP-1 n increase plasma concentration of GLP-1 n increases insulin secretion, suppresses glucagon release, and improves control of fasting and postprandial hyperglycaemia. They do not affect gastric emptying, satiety and body weight. They are administered orally as adjuvants in patients with type 2 DM. Allergic reactions can occur with sitagliptin. Hepatotoxicity may occur with vildagliptin. Drug interactions are rare with vildagliptin. Risk of hypoglycaemia is low.Thiazolidinediones.  They increase sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin.Pioglitazone  /H20903 Selective agonists of PPAR-/H9253   and    (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-/H9253)rosiglitazoneBind to nuclear PPAR-/H9253Activate insulin-responsive genes that regulatecarbohydrate and lipid metabolismSensitize the peripheral tissues to insulinReduce blood glucose by:– increasing glucose transport into muscle and adipose tissue– inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis– promoting lipogenesisOther Actions.  Pioglitazone reduces serum triglyceride and increases HDL levels.Pharmacokinetics.  Pioglitazone is almost completely absorbed from GI tract, highly bound to plasma proteins (95%) and metabolized in the liver.

354PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESAdverse Effects.  Nausea, vomiting, anaemia, oedema, weight gain, and precipitation of heart failure in patients with low cardiac reserve; rarely hepatotoxicity and bladder cancer may occur. There is an increased risk of cardiovascular events with rosiglitazone. Its use has been suspended in some countries.Use.  Pioglitazone is used alone or in combination with sulphonylureas/metformin in patients with type 2 DM./H9251-Glucosidase Inhibitors.  These drugs should be given just before food.Acarbose, Miglitol and Voglibose.  They reduce intestinal absorption of carbohydrates by inhibiting the enzyme /H9251-glucosidase in the brush border of the small intestine and reduce postprandial hyperglycaemia. They are mainly used in obese patients with type  2 DM. Side effects are mainly on GI tract: ﬂatulence, fullness and diarrhoea.GLP-1 Analogues (e.g. Exenatide, Liraglutide, Albiglutide, Dulaglutide, Lixisenatide).  GLP-1, an incretin, is released from the gut after meals. It stimulates glucose-depen-dent insulin secretion, suppresses glucagon release and slows gastric emptying. It is degraded by DPP-4; its plasma half-life is 1–2 minutes; hence, it cannot be used therapeutically. GLP-1 analogues are resistant to DPP-4. Their action is similar to GLP-1. They are injected s.c. 1 hour before breakfast and dinner in type 2 DM pa-tients. They are mainly used as adjuncts to other antidiabetic agents. This results in better glycaemic control, reduction in HbA1c and body weight. They may help to pre-vent progression of /H9252-cell failure in type 2 diabetes. Extended-release s.c. preparation of exenatide is available. Liraglutide is longer acting. Albiglutide and dulaglutide are long acting with a duration of 1 week. The main side effect is nausea. They usually do not cause hypoglycaemia, but it may occur when used in combination with other antidiabetic agents.Pramlintide.  It is a synthetic analogue of amylin (islet amyloid polypeptide). It de-creases glucagon secretion, delays gastric emptying, suppresses appetite and decreases body weight. Pramlintide (as an adjuvant) is administered subcutaneously in patients with type 1 and type 2 DM just before meals. Nausea and hypoglycaemia are common adverse effects.Sodium–Glucose Co-Transporter-2 Inhibitors. For example, dapagliﬂozin, canagliﬂozin and empagliﬂozin n inhibit SGLT-2 in renal proximal tubule n inhibit glucose reab-sorption n glycosuria, gblood glucose levels. SGLT-2 inhibitors are used as adjunct medication for better glycaemic control. Adverse effects include urinary tract infection.Agents Affecting Calcium Balance  PH1.36CALCIUMAbout 99% of calcium of our body is in bone and teeth. Calcium metabolism is chieﬂy regulated by three hormones: parathormone (PTH), vitamin D and calcitonin. PTH plays a central role in regulating calcium homeostasis. Calcium metabolism is also

Emergency treatment of acute attack (hypoparathyroid tetany) (a) 10% calcium gluconate 10–20 mL given i.v. slowly until tetany ceases. (b) Oral calcium salts should be started as soon as possible. 2. Treatment of chronic hypoparathyroidism (a) The treatment of choice is vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol). (b) Oral calcium salts should be started as soon as possible.HyperparathyroidismHyperparathyroidism is characterized by increased levels of parathormone, often due to para-thyroid tumour. There is hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria. Treatment involves surgical re-moval of the tumour. Some of the cases of hyperparathyroidism can be treated with cinacalcet.Cinacalcet (Calcimimetic Agent)I Binds to receptors on parathyroid gland ng PTH secretion ng serum Ca2/H11001 levels.I Route: Oral.I Use: Hypercalcaemia due to parathyroid tumour; secondary hyperparathyroidism due to renal disease.I Adverse effect: Hypocalcaemia.T eriparatideI Recombinant preparations of PTH.I Route: Administered subcutaneously, once daily.I Stimulates bone formation.I Use: Treatment of severe osteoporosis – improves bone mineral densityI Adverse effect: HypercalcaemiaI Expensive.CalcitoninCalcitonin is synthesized by the ‘C’ cells of the thyroid. It is a peptide hormone. The main actions of calcitonin are to lower serum calcium and phosphate by direct action on bone and kidney. Calcitonin secretion is stimulated when the serum calcium level becomes high and vice versa.Actions of Calcitonin (Generally Opposite to That of PTH)KidneyCalcitoninBoneDirectly inhibits osteoclasts of bone ↓Bone resorptionInhibits reabsorption ofCa2/H11001 and phosphate inthe renal tubules↓↓Plasma calcium↓↓Plasma phosphate

In postmenopausal osteoporosis and corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis: Salmon calcitonin is used as nasal spray along with calcium and vitamin D supplements.Adverse effects are nausea, vomiting, ﬂushing and pain at the site of injection.VITAMIN DVitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin. It is a prohormone, which is converted in the body into a number of biologically active metabolites that function as true hormone. Vitamin D, together with PTH, plays a central role in the maintenance of plasma calcium and bone formation. Vitamin D is found in ﬁsh liver oils and dairy products; it is also syn-thesized in the skin on exposure to sunlight.Pathways of Vitamin D ProductionErgocalciferol(dietary vitamin D2)25-Hydroxyergocalciferol(vitamin D2)1/H9251, 25-Dihydroxy-ergocalciferol(vitamin D2, active)Cholecalciferol(vitamin D3, inactive)25-Hydroxycholecalciferol(calcifediol, less active)1/H9251, 25-Dihydroxy-cholecalciferol(calcitriol, active)7-DehydrocholesterolSkin(UV light)LiverKidneyAlfacalcidol(1/H9251-hydroxy-cholecalciferol)Liver

Mineralization of boneUtilized forVitamin D deﬁciency causes rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Hypervita-minosis D may occur due to acute large dose or long-term use of vitamin D. The signs and symptoms of hypercalcaemia are nausea, weakness, fatigue and polyuria. If hyper-calcaemia persists, calcium salts are deposited in the kidney, resulting in renal failure and renal stones. Treatment includes immediate stoppage of vitamin D, low-calcium diet, intravenous hydration and administration of glucocorticoids.Preparations of Vitamin DI Ergocalciferol (vitamin D2): Oral capsules 400 IU/day for prevention of rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults.I Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3): Oral and i.m. injection.I Calcitriol: Active form of vitamin D.

Prevention (400 IU/day) and treatment (4000 IU/day) of nutritional rickets and osteomalacia. 2. Renal rickets: It is associated with chronic renal failure; hence, the conversion of calcifediol to calcitriol does not occur. It is treated with calcitriol or alfacalcidol.}

360PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES 3. Vitamin D–dependent rickets: It is an inborn error of vitamin D metabolism. There is a failure of conversion of calcifediol to calcitriol. It responds to calcitriol or alfacalcidol. 4. Vitamin D–resistant rickets and osteomalacia: They are X-linked disorders of calcium and phosphate metabolism. They are treated with large doses of  vitamin D and phosphate. 5. In hypoparathyroidism, there is hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia. Calcitriol and alfacalcidol are effective for temporary treatment of hypocalcaemia. 6. Administration of vitamin D with calcium in senile or postmenopausal osteopo-rosis improves calcium balance and may reduce the risk of fractures. 7. Vitamin D analogue, calcipotriol, is used topically in the treatment of psoriasis.BisphosphonatesBisphosphonates are analogues of pyrophosphate. They are Pamidronate (i.v. infusion), Alendronate (oral), Zoledronate (i.v. infusion), Etidronate (oral, i.v.), Tiludronate (oral), Risedronate (oral), etc. (Mnemonic: PAZET)MECHANISM OF ACTION Bisphosphonates exert antiresorptive effect. They:I Have high afﬁnity for calcium in the bone n accumulate in areas of bone resorp-tion n taken up by osteoclasts n inhibits ability of osteoclasts to form rufﬂed border and promotes their apoptosis.I Interfere with mevalonate pathway of cholesterol synthesis which is required for normal function of osteoclasts (this is the important mechanism of action for alendronate, risedronate, etc.).PHARMACOKINETICS Bisphosphonates are highly polar, hence, poorly absorbed through GI tract; a part of the absorbed drug is incorporated into bone and remains for long from months to years. The free drug is excreted unchanged in urine. Zoledronate has less irritant effect on injected vein; it is administered once a year.USES 1 .  Paget disease of bone: Bisphosphonates are the treatment of choice for Paget disease. They are usually given cyclically. They reduce bone pain and decrease alkaline phos-phatase level. 2. For prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis: These drugs im-prove bone mineral density and reduce incidence of vertebral fracture. 3 .

Hypercalcaemia of malignancy: Bisphosphonates control hypercalcaemia by in-hibiting bone resorption. Zoledronate is most potent and is the drug of choice for malignant hypercalcaemia. 5 .  Bisphosphonates are also useful to control hypercalcaemia of hyperparathyroidism. 6. T o relieve pain of lytic bone lesions.

3619—ENDOCRINE PHARMACOLOGYADVERSE EFFECTS They include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, heartburn, oesophagitis, peptic ulcer, fever, myalgia, hypocalcaemia, headache and skin rashes. Oral bisphosphonates should be taken with plenty of water and the patient should remain upright for at least 30 minutes to prevent oesophagitis. Flu-like symptoms can occur on parenteral administration. Rarely, osteonecrosis of the jaw may occur.DRUGS USEFUL IN HYPERCALCAEMIA Bisphosphonates and mithramycin (inhibit bone resorption), glucocorticoids (gCa2/H11001 absorption and h its excretion), furosemide.Strontium Ranelate.

362CHAPTER 10Drugs Acting on UterusUterine Stimulants and Relaxants  PH1.41UTERINE STIMULANTS (OXYTOCICS, ECBOLICS)Oxytocics are drugs that cause uterine contraction. They include:I OxytocinI Ergot derivatives: Ergometrine and methylergometrineI Prostaglandins: PGE2, PGF2/H9251, 15-methyl PGF2/H9251 and misoprostol (PGE1)OxytocinIt is a hormone synthesized in the hypothalamus along with antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and stored in neurohypophysis. The storage, release and actions of oxytocin are shown below:Supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus along with ADHPosterior pituitaryOxytocinSynthesisStorageParturition, suckling, coitus, etc. (stimuli for release)ActionsContraction of thepregnant uterusContraction of myoepithelial cells of thefemale breast (milk ejection occurs)Pharmacological Actions 1. Uterus: Oxytocin stimulates contraction of the pregnant uterus.Uterine sensitivity to oxytocin is increased by oestrogens and decreased by progestins. Oestrogens increase oxytocin receptors.I Nonpregnant uterus is relatively insensitive to oxytocin.I In early pregnancy, uterus is fairly resistant to oxytocin. High dose of oxytocin is required to stimulate the uterus. The sensitivity of uterus to oxytocin gradually increases during pregnancy, especially in the last half, with a sharp rise near term.Oxytocin increases both force and frequency of uterine (only fundus and body) contractions.

36310—DRUGS ACTING ON UTERUSWith intravenous infusion of low dose of oxytocin, there is a period of com-plete relaxation between uterine contractions. This helps to maintain blood ﬂow to the placenta and fetus, thereby preventing fetal asphyxia. Large doses of oxytocin further increase the force and frequency of uterine contractions, which can lead to fetal asphyxia.Mechanism of ActionOxytocin binds to speciﬁ c G-protein–coupledreceptors on myometrium
This leads to:• Generation of IP3 (inositol triphosphate)• Release of Ca2 from intracellular stores• Increased production of PGs by endometriumContraction of the pregnant uterus 2. Breast: Oxytocin contracts myoepithelial cells of the breast and causes milk ejection. 3. Kidney: Oxytocin (high doses) n ADH-like action n decreased urine output. Water intoxication may occur if large amount of ﬂuids is administered along with oxytocin. 4. Cardiovascular system: Oxytocin (high doses) n vasodilatation and transient hypotension n reﬂex tachycardia and ﬂushing.Preparations and Route of AdministrationI Oxytocin is not effective orally since it is a peptide.I Synthetic oxytocin is commonly used; administered as intravenous infusion or intramuscularly.I Syntometrine (1 mL contains oxytocin 5 IU /H11001 ergometrine 500 mcg), intramuscularly.Uses 1. Induction of labour: Oxytocin is the drug of choice for induction of labour. It is administered by i.v. infusion. The starting dose should be low and the rate of infu-sion is monitored and adjusted according to response. During oxytocin infusion, uterine contractions, maternal blood pressure (BP), fetal and maternal heart rate should be monitored.Oxytocin is preferred for induction of labour because: (a) The dose (rate of infusion) can be adjusted according to the response. (b) It has a short plasma half-life. Its action can be terminated by stopping the infu-sion immediately, if there are signs of uterine hyperstimulation/fetal distress.

364PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES (c) At low doses, there is a period of complete relaxation between the uterine  contractions. This helps to maintain blood ﬂow to the placenta and fetus, thereby preventing fetal asphyxia. (d) It does not interfere with fetal descent, as it does not contract the lower segment.Cephalopelvic disproportion, placenta praevia, previous classical caesarean  section, transverse fetal lie, fetal distress, etc. should be excluded prior to  administration of oxytocin. 2. Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH): Oxytocin is used for prevention (i.m. or i.v. infusion) and treatment (i.v. infusion) of PPH. It contracts uterine smooth muscle resulting in compression of the blood vessels as they pass through the myometrium – bleeding is arrested. Oxytocin has fewer side effects than ergot derivatives and is preferred to them for prevention and treatment of PPH. 3 .  Oxytocin (i.v. infusion) is also used to increase intensity, frequency and duration of uterine contractions, if they are not adequate (uterine inertia), during labour. It should not be used to enhance uterine contractions, if labour is progressing satisfactorily. 4. Intranasal oxytocin may be useful in breast engorgement. Oxytocin stimulates the myoepithelial cells resulting in milk let down.Adverse Effects 1. Uterine hyperstimulation: Overdosage of oxytocin can cause strong uterine con-tractions which can result in uterine rupture, fetal asphyxia or even fetal death. 2. If large amount of ﬂuids is infused along with oxytocin, water intoxication (head-ache, vomiting, drowsiness and convulsions) can occur. 3. High dose of oxytocin may cause hypotension and reﬂex tachycardia.CarbetocinIt is an analogue of oxytocin with a longer duration of action. It is useful for the preven-tion of uterine atony following caesarean section and for prevention of PPH.Ergot DerivativesErgometrine and Methylergometrine (Methergine).  Ergometrine (ergonovine) is a natural er-got alkaloid. Methylergometrine is a semisynthetic derivative. They have similar pharmaco-logical actions, but methylergometrine has more potent effect on uterus than ergometrine.Pharmacological Actions 1 . Uterus: Ergometrine and methylergometrine stimulate uterine contractions involving both upper and lower segments. Force, frequency and duration of contractions are in-creased. At low doses, contractions are rhythmic with a period of relaxation in between. But at higher doses, the contractions become more powerful, basal tone is increased and uterus passes into a state of sustained tonic contraction – uterine tetany. 2. GIT: In high doses, they can increase peristaltic movements. 3. CVS: They have weak vasoconstrictor effect. In therapeutic doses, they can increase BP , but it is not signiﬁcant.Pharmacokinetics.  Ergometrine and methylergometrine are administered parenterally or orally. They have a rapid onset of action – within a minute of i.v., 3–5 minutes after i.m. and 15–20 minutes after oral administration. They are metabolized in liver and excreted in urine.Therapeutic Uses of Ergometrine and Methylergometrine 1. Ergometrine and methylergometrine are used for prevention and treatment of PPH. For prophylaxis, they are usually given after the delivery of anterior shoulder. Methy-lergometrine is preferred to ergometrine, as it has more potent effect on the uterus. 

36510—DRUGS ACTING ON UTERUSThese drugs are useful in PPH because they cause sustained contractions of the uter-ine smooth muscle resulting in compression of blood vessels and arrest of bleeding.Methylergometrine 0.2 mg i.m. is administered prophylactically to prevent PPH and 0.2 mg i.v. to control PPH. A combination of ergometrine with oxytocin can be used to treat PPH. 2. After caesarean section, methylergometrine is administered to prevent uterine atony and control bleeding. 3. Ergometrine and methylergometrine are used orally to hasten the involution of the uterus when it is delayed.Adverse Effects.  Nausea, vomiting and rise in BP especially in hypertensive patients. They may interfere with lactation as they decrease prolactin secretion.Contraindications.  These include hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, sepsis, preeclampsia and eclampsia.ProstaglandinsPGE1 (misoprostol) and PGE2 (dinoprostone) promote ripening and dilatation of the cervix, thus useful for induction of labour.Prior use of prostaglandins (oral, vaginal), during induction of labour with oxytocin produces synergistic effect on uterine contractility. There should be at least 4–6 hours gap between their administration.Misoprostol and carboprost stimulate uterine contractions and can be used to prevent/ treat PPH. Misoprostol is administered orally/sublingually, while carboprost is given in-tramuscularly.Uterine Relaxants (Tocolytics; Fig. 10.1)T ocolytics are drugs that inhibit uterine contractions./H9252-ADRENERGIC AGONISTSThe selective /H92522-agonists used as uterine relaxants are isoxsuprine, salbutamol, terbuta-line and ritodrine.

During acute phase, they are administered by  i.v. infusion. For prophylactic therapy, they are given orally.CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERSNifedipine acts by inhibiting the inﬂux of Ca2/H11001 ions into the myometrial cells. It is used orally as tocolytic. Side effects are fewer than /H92522-agonists.ATOSIBAN (OXYTOCIN-RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST)It competitively blocks the oxytocin receptors of the uterus and induces uterine relax-ation. It is given by i.v. infusion. Side effects are less as compared to /H92522-agonists.PROSTAGLANDIN SYNTHESIS INHIBITORSNSAIDs, like indomethacin, produce tocolytic effect by inhibiting prostaglandin synthe-sis. But they are not used because of adverse effects, such as premature closure of ductus arteriosus with subsequent development of pulmonary hypertension. These drugs can be used for relief of dysmenorrhoea, but not to delay labour. Both beneﬁcial and adverse effects of these drugs are due to inhibition of PG synthesis.MAGNESIUM SULPHATEMagnesium sulphate is given by i.v. infusion. It has a depressant action on uterine smooth muscle, central nervous system (CNS) and myocardium. It is used to control convulsions and BP in toxaemia of pregnancy. It is useful when /H92522-agonists are contra-indicated. The side effects are hypotension, hypothermia, cardiac arrhythmias, CNS and respiratory depression.PROGESTERONEIt has relaxant effect on the uterus. Progestins are used in the treatment of threatened abortion.NITRIC OXIDE DONORSNitroglycerin and other nitrates have tocolytic action, but they may cause maternal hypotension.OTHERSHalothane, a ﬂuorinated inhalational general anaesthetic, has a potent tocolytic effect.USES OF TOCOLYTICS 1.

367CHAPTER 11ChemotherapyGeneral Considerations  PH1.42CHEMOTHERAPYChemotherapy is the treatment of infectious diseases or malignancy with drugs which destroy microorganisms or cancer cells preferentially with minimal damage to host  tissues. The infection may be due to bacteria, virus, fungi, protozoa or helminths.BACTERICIDAL AGENTSThey kill or destroy microorganisms, e.g. penicillins, cephalosporins and aminoglyco-sides.BACTERIOSTATIC AGENTSThey inhibit the growth and multiplication of microorganisms, e.g. sulphonamides, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol and erythromycin.At high concentration, some of the ‘static’ drugs may produce ‘cidal’ effect; for  example, chloramphenicol is a bacteriostatic drug, but at high concentrations it is  bactericidal against Haemophilus inﬂuenzae and Neisseria meningitidis.ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTSAntimicrobial agents (AMAs) are naturally obtained, semisynthetic and synthetic drugs that act against microorganisms. Natural sources include bacteria (bacitracin, colistin, polymyxin B, aztreonam), fungi (penicillin, cephalosporin, griseofulvin) and actinomy-cetes (tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, aminoglycosides, macrolides).ANTIBIOTICSAntibiotics are substances obtained from microorganisms that kill or inhibit growth of other microorganisms at a very low concentration.MINIMUM INHIBITORY CONCENTRATIONMinimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is the minimum concentration of an AMA that prevents visible growth of a microorganism.

The resistance may be natural or acquired. Natural resistance is genetically determined, e.g. normally, gram-negative bacilli are not affected by penicillin G.In acquired resistance, microbes that initially respond to an AMA develop resistance later to the same AMA by mutation or gene transfer.

36911—CHEMOTHERAPYin the sequence of DNA. Resistance can be single-step mutation (e.g. resistance of Staphylococcus to rifampin) or multistep mutation (mutation in a gene, which results in resistance, occurs in more than one step; the microorganism becomes gradually less sensitive to the drug, e.g. resistance to erythromycin). The transfer of genes for drug resistance occurs by the following mechanisms:Transduction.  There is transfer of DNA, carrying a gene for resistance, from one bacterium to another through bacteriophage, e.g. resistance of strains of Staphylococcus aureus to antibiotics is mediated via transduction.Transformation.  The resistance carrying genetic material, which is released into the environment by resistant bacteria, is taken up by other sensitive bacteria which then become resistant to the AMA, e.g. penicillin G resistance in pneumococci.RB: ResistantbacteriaRBRelease free DNA carrying gene for resistance into the environmentTaken up by sensitive bacteria which then become resistantto AMAConjugation.  Conjugation is the transfer of genetic material carrying resistance between bacteria by direct contact through sex pilus, e.g. Escherichia coli resistance to streptomycin.Development of Resistance to Antimicrobial Agents.  There are several mechanisms by which an organism can develop resistance to an AMA. The important mechanisms are as follows: 1. Production of inactivating enzymes: For example, staphylococci, gonococci and E. coli produce /H9252-lactamases that can destroy some of the penicillins and cephalo-sporins. 2. An efﬂux pump mechanism: It is a mechanism that prevents the accumulation of the drug in the microorganism, e.g. resistance of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, macrolides, etc. 3. Decreased entry of AMA into the organism due to alteration in the channel/transporter required for its entry into the organism. 4. Alteration of the binding site: For example, change in penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in case of certain pneumococci with decreased afﬁnity for penicillins. 5. Absence of metabolic pathway: For example, sulphonamide-resistant bacteria can utilize preformed folic acid without the need for usual metabolic steps.Cross-Resistance.  Organisms that develop resistance to an AMA may also show resistance to other chemically related AMAs. The cross-resistance among AMAs could be either one-way or two-way. Cross-resistance among tetracyclines and sulphonamides is usually ‘two-way’ .Tetracycline  I Doxycycline (Tetracyclines)Sulphadiazine  I Sulphadoxine (Sulphonamides)The ‘one-way’ resistance is seen between neomycin and streptomycin. Neomycin-resistant organisms are resistant to streptomycin but streptomycin-resistant organisms may be sensitive to neomycin.Neomycin  I Streptomycin

370PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESPrevention of Development of Resistance to Antimicrobial Agents.  It is done by: 1. Selecting right AMA. 2. Giving right dose of the AMA for proper duration. 3. Proper combination of AMAs, e.g. in tuberculosis (TB), multidrug therapy (MDT) is used to prevent development of resistance to antitubercular drugs by mycobacteria.SUPERINFECTION (SUPRAINFECTION)It is deﬁned as the occurrence of a new infection due to antimicrobial therapy for  another infection. The causative organism of superinfection should be different from that of the primary disease. Most of the AMAs – especially broad-spectrum antibiotics (tetracyclines and chloramphenicol), clindamycin, ampicillin, etc. – alter the normal bacterial ﬂora, as a result of which the host-defence mechanism is impaired. Hence, pathogenic organisms invade the host, multiply and produce superinfection. The  causative organism may be fungi or bacteria.Pathogenesis.  Superinfection is associated with suppression/change of normal ﬂora in the body following treatment with certain antimicrobials. The pathogenesis of superinfection is described in Fig. 11.2.The sites involved in superinfection are those body cavities that have direct communica-tion with the exterior, i.e. rectum, oral cavity, vagina, lower urinary tract, upper respiratory tract, etc. (Table 11.1).Factors Predisposing to Superinfection.

It can be minimized by (i) using speciﬁc AMAs, (ii) avoiding  unnecessary use of AMAs and (iii) use of probiotics, e.g. Lactobacillus.CHEMOPROPHYLAXISChemoprophylaxis is the administration of AMAs to prevent infection or to prevent development of disease in persons who are already infected (see Table 11.2). The ideal time to initiate therapy is before the organism enters the body or at least before the development of signs and symptoms of the disease.Indications for Chemoprophylaxis 1. To prevent endocarditis in patients with valvular lesion before undergoing surgical procedures: Surgical procedure n mucosal damage n bacteraemia n affects damaged valve n endocarditis. 2. To protect healthy persons: Chloroquine/meﬂoquine is used for chemoprophylaxis of malaria for those travelling to malaria endemic area. 3 .  To pre vent infection in patients undergoing organ transplantation: Oral FQs can be used. 4 .  To pre vent opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients, e.g. cotrimoxazole is used to prevent Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in AIDS patients. 5. Prior to surgical procedures: AMAs are administered to all patients prior to major surgical procedures or implantation of prosthetic devices and in diabetic patients or patients on prolonged corticosteroids to prevent wound infection after surgery. 6. To prevent infection in patients with burns: T opical silver sulphadiazine and systemic antibiotics are used.InfectionAntimicrobial agent with dose and duration 1.

The effectiveness of chemoprophylaxis depends on the selection of a speciﬁc AMA, its dosage, time of initiation and duration of antimicrobial therapy. The suggested chemoprophylactic regimens are listed in Table 11.2.Empirical therapy: It is the use of AMAs before identiﬁcation of causative organ-ism or availability of susceptibility test results, e.g. combination of cefotaxime, vancomycin and ampicillin is used as empirical therapy for suspected bacterial meningitis (before test results are available) to cover possible organisms likely to cause meningitis.Deﬁnitive therapy: It involves the use of AMA after identiﬁcation/susceptibility tests of the causative organism responsible for the disease.COMBINATION OF ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTSIt is the simultaneous use of two or more AMAs for the treatment of certain infectious diseases.Indications/Advantages of Antimicrobial Combinations 1. To broaden the spectrum of activity in mixed bacterial infections: Intra-abdominal, pulmonary, hepatic, pelvic, brain abscesses, etc., are often due to both aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Hence, they require antimicrobial combination therapy.I Metronidazole /H11001 ceftriaxone for brain abscess 2. To broaden the spectrum of action in severe infections when the aetiology is not known: Combination of cefotaxime, vancomycin and ampicillin is used for empirical therapy of suspected bacterial meningitis. Later, the AMA should be selected according to the type of organism, culture and sensitivity results. 3. To increase antibacterial activity in the treatment of speciﬁc infections (for synergistic effect)I Ampicillin (bactericidal) /H11001 gentamicin (bactericidal) for enterococcal endocarditisI Carbenicillin /H11001 gentamicin for infections due to PseudomonasPenicillins, by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis, facilitate the entry of  gentamicin into the bacterial cell (synergistic effect) resulting in more  complete eradication of the organism.I Sulphamethoxazole /H11001 trimethoprim for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (see p. 377 for mechanism of action)I Rifampin (cidal) /H11001 dapsone (static) in leprosy – synergistic effect 4. To prevent emergence of resistant microorganisms: In TB, leprosy and HIV infection, combination therapy is used. 5. To reduce duration of therapy: MDT is used in TB and leprosy. 6. To reduce adverse effects: AMB and ﬂucytosine in cryptococcal meningitis: The dose-dependent toxicity (especially nephrotoxicity) of AMB is decreased due to reduction in dosage (see p. 425).Disadvantages of Antimicrobial Drug Combinations 1. Increased toxicity, e.g. vancomycin with tobramycin may cause enhanced nephrotoxicity. 2. Increased cost. 3 .  Decreased antibacterial activity due to improper combinations, e.g. in pneumococcal meningitis, activity of penicillin G (bactericidal) against pneumococci will decrease 

37311—CHEMOTHERAPYif combined with tetracycline (bacteriostatic). Penicillins act mainly on rapidly  multiplying bacteria; tetracycline inhibits multiplication of bacteria because of  its static effect, thus reducing effect of penicillins. 4. Increased likelihood of superinfection. 5. Irrational combination of AMAs can lead to development of resistance.List of Microorganisms 1. Gram-positive cocci: S. aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus /H9252-haemolyticus, S. pneumoniae (pneumococcus), Enterococcus 2. Gram-negative cocci: Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis 3. Gram-positive bacilli: Bacillus anthracis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Clostrid-ium tetani, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difﬁcile 4. Gram-negative bacilli: E. coli, Enterobacter spp., Proteus, Pseudomonas, Salmonella, Shigella, H. inﬂuenzae, H. ducreyi, Klebsiella, Brucella, Vibrio cholerae 5. Acid-fast bacilli: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacte-rium avium complex (MAC) 6. Spirochetes: Treponema pallidum, Leptospira 7. Others: Rickettsia, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Helicobacter pylori, etc.SELECTION OF AN APPROPRIATE ANTIMICROBIAL AGENT (Fig. 11.3)Patient Factors 1. Age: Use of chloramphenicol in premature infants may produce grey baby syndrome because metabolic functions of liver and renal excretion are not fully developed. Sulphonamides in neonates can cause kernicterus.Renal function declines with age; hence, elderly patients are more prone  to ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity with aminoglycosides due to their reduced clearance by kidney.

Fig. 11.3 Factors affecting selection of an antimicrobial agent.

374PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES 2. History of allergy: In patients with history of asthma, allergic rhinitis, hay fever, etc., there is an increased risk of penicillin allergy; hence, such drugs should be avoided in them. 3. Genetic abnormalities: Primaquine, pyrimethamine, sulphonamides, sulphones, FQs, etc., may cause haemolysis in patients with G6PD deﬁciency. 4 .  Pregnancy: Most of the AMAs cross placental barrier and may affect the developing fetus. The risk of teratogenicity is highest during the ﬁrst trimester. For example,  use of tetracyclines during pregnancy may affect fetal dentition and bone growth. There is an increased incidence of hepatotoxicity with tetracycline in pregnant women. 5. Host defences: In immunocompromised patients (AIDS, leukaemias and other malignancies), normal defence mechanisms are impaired – bacteriostatic drugs may not be adequate; hence bactericidal agents should be used to treat  infection. 6 .  Hepatic dysfunction: I n  p a t i e n t s  w i t h  h e p a t i c  d y s f u n c t i o n ,  d r u g s  l i k e  c h l o r a m-phenicol, erythromycin and rifampin should be avoided or require dose reduction to minimize toxic effects. 7. Renal dysfunction: In renal failure, drugs that are eliminated via kidney can accumulate in the body and cause severe toxic effects. Hence, aminoglycosides, vancomycin, AMB, FQs, etc., should be avoided or require dose reduction in  patients with impaired renal function. 8. Local factors (a) Antimicrobial activity of sulphonamides is markedly reduced in the presence of pus. (b) The activity of aminoglycosides is enhanced at alkaline pH.Drug Factors 1. Route of administration: Depending on the severity and site of infection,  AMAs have to be chosen. Some of the AMAs can be administered orally as  well as parenterally. For mild-to-moderate infections, oral route is usually  preferred, but for severe infections like endocarditis and meningitis, paren-teral AMAs are preferred during initial stages of therapy. Some AMAs like aminoglycosides are not effective orally; they are administered parenterally for systemic infections. 2. The spectrum of antimicrobial activity: It is an important factor while selecting an AMA especially during empirical therapy. 3. Bactericidal/bacteriostatic effect: Bactericidal drugs kill organisms, while static drugs inhibit growth and multiplication. In immunocompromised states, the host-defence mechanisms are impaired; hence, bactericidal drugs are required even for trivial infections. 4. Cost of AMA: The cost of treatment has to be considered while selecting an AMA. The expensive antimicrobials should not be used routinely when alternative cheaper and effective AMAs are available. 5. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic considerationsI Time-dependent inhibition: This is observed with certain AMAs like /H9252-lactams and glycopeptides. Their antimicrobial action depends on the duration of time the drug concentration remains above the MIC in the dosing interval. Thus, they are administered in multiple doses.I Concentration-dependent killing: For aminoglycosides and FQs, the antimi-crobial effect depends on the ratio of peak plasma concentration to MIC.  

37511—CHEMOTHERAPYA single daily dose of aminoglycosides is as/more effective than multiple  doses.I Ability to penetrate into the infected areaI Ability to cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB): Clindamycin is effective against anaerobes, but not useful for anaerobic brain abscess as it does not reach cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) and brain. Anaerobic brain abscess can be treated effectively with third-generation cephalosporins or combination of metronidazole and chloramphenicol.I Levoﬂoxacin attains good concentration in the lung, skin/soft tissues and urinary tract – produces high cure rates in community-acquired pneumonia, skin infections, etc.Organism-Related Factors.  In severe infections, empirical therapy with antimicrobial drug combination should be initiated depending on the clinical diagnosis. Later,  the AMA should be selected according to the type of organism, culture and sensitivity reports. The bacterial resistance to AMAs and cross-resistance should also be considered while selecting an AMA.SulphonamidesSulphonamides were the ﬁrst effective AMAs used in the treatment of bacterial  infections in humans. They are derivatives of sulphanilamide (para-aminobenzene sulphonamide) and are synthetic compounds (Fig. 11.4).SulphonamidesSystemic-acting agents Local-acting agents• Sulphacetamide• Silver sulphadiazine• MafenideOthersSulphasalazine (acts both locally andsystemically)Short-acting(4–8 h)SulphadiazineIntermediate -acting (8–12 h)SulphamethoxazoleLong-acting(>7 days)SulphadoxineMechanism of Action.  para-Aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is a precursor of folic acid which is essential for growth and multiplication of many bacteria. Sulphonamides, be-ing structurally similar to PABA, competitively inhibit folate synthase enzyme and pre-vent the formation of folic acid, thereby producing bacteriostatic effect. They are not effective in the presence of pus as it is rich in PABA, purines and thymidine. Mammalian H2NSO2NH2Fig. 11.4 Basic structure of sulphonamides.

376PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATEScells do not synthesize folic acid, but utilize folic acid present in diet, hence are unaf-fected by sulphonamides./H17054Para-aminobenzoic acidSulphonamidesFolate synthetaseDihydrofolic acidFolate reductaseTetrahydrofolic acidBacterial Resistance to Sulphonamides.  Most of the bacteria have developed resis-tance to sulphonamides. It could be due to: 1. Decreased afﬁnity of folate synthetase for the drug 2. Efﬂux of the drug by bacteria 3. Development of alternate metabolic pathway for folate synthesisPharmacokinetics.  All systemic-acting sulphonamides are well absorbed from the gut. They are bound to plasma proteins, particularly albumin. Sulphonamides are distributed in almost all tissues of the body including CSF. They cross placental barrier and reach fetal circulation; they are metabolized in liver mainly by acetylation. The acetylated prod-ucts have no antibacterial activity but retain the toxic potential of the parent compound. Sulphonamides are excreted partly unchanged and partly as metabolic products.Adverse Effects 1. The acetylated products of sulphonamides are poorly soluble in acidic urine and may cause crystalluria, haematuria or even obstruction to urinary tract. This may be avoided by taking plenty of water and alkalinizing the urine. 2. Hypersensitivity reactions include skin rashes, itching, drug fever and exfoliative dermatitis. Stevens–Johnson syndrome is the most severe type of hypersensitivity reaction characterized by fever, erythema multiforme and ulceration of mucous membranes. 3. In patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deﬁciency, sulphonamides may cause acute haemolytic anaemia. 4. Rarely cause hepatitis and suppression of bone marrow. 5. Use of sulphonamides in neonates, especially in premature babies, may cause displacement of bilirubin from plasma proteins. The free bilirubin can cross BBB and get deposited in the basal ganglia resulting in kernicterus.Drug Interactions.  Sulphonamides potentiate the effect of phenytoin, methotrexate (MTX), oral anticoagulants and oral hypoglycaemic agents (sulfonylureas) by inhibiting their metabolism and displacing them from plasma protein binding sites.Therapeutic Uses.  Sulphonamides alone are rarely used now for systemic infections. They are used in combination with other AMAs. 1. Sulphadoxine and pyrimethamine are used in combination with artesunate in the treatment of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria. 2. Sulphadiazine and pyrimethamine combination is the drug of choice for toxoplasmosis. 3. Nocardiosis: Sulphamethoxazole in combination with trimethoprim is used.

37711—CHEMOTHERAPY 4. Sulphamethoxazole in combination with trimethoprim is used in the treatment of P. jiroveci infection in patients with AIDS. 5 .  Sodium salt of sulphacetamide is used exclusively for the treatment of ophthalmic infections. It is administered as eye drops or eye ointment. It is preferred because of: (a) High aqueous solubility (b) Neutral pH and nonirritant nature of the drug (c) Good penetrability on topical administration (d) Low incidence of hypersensitivity reactions (e) Low cost 6. Silver sulfadiazine and mafenide are used topically for preventing infection of burn wound. Silver sulfadiazine slowly releases silver ions which are toxic to  microorganisms. It is not effective in the presence of pus and tissue ﬂuid. 7. Sulphasalazine is useful in the treatment of inﬂammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis. 8. Rheumatic fever: Sulphadiazine can be used for prophylaxis of rheumatic fever.CotrimoxazoleCotrimoxazole is a World Health Organization (WHO)–approved ﬁxed-dose combina-tion of sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim in the ratio of 5:1. It was introduced in late 1960s; even today, it is one of the commonly used AMAs.Mechanism of Action
T etrahydrofolic acid (THFA)Para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA)Folate synthetase  /H17054 SulphamethoxazoleDihydrofolic acid (DHFA)Dihydrofolate reductase  /H17054 TrimethoprimCotrimoxazole (sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim in a dose ratio of 5:1) produces se-quential blockade, i.e. two drugs interfere with two successive steps in the same metabolic pathway; hence, their combination produces supra-additive effect. Sulphamethoxazole in-hibits folate synthetase, whereas trimethoprim inhibits folate reductase enzyme.  The pharmacokinetic properties of these two drugs match each other almost closely, hence are selected for combination. They have similar half-lives. Optimum synergistic effect is seen at a concentration ratio of 20:1 (sulphamethoxazole to trimethoprim) in blood and tissues. The advantages of this combination are the following: 1. Individually, both are bacteriostatic but the combination has cidal effect. 2. Chances of development of bacterial resistance is greatly reduced.Pharmacokinetics.  Cotrimoxazole is well absorbed after oral administration and is also available for parenteral use, widely distributed to various tissues including CSF and sputum, metabolized in liver and excreted mainly in urine; hence, dose reduction is needed in patients with renal insufﬁciency.Adverse Effects.  Cotrimoxazole is well tolerated in most patients. Most of the adverse ef-fects are same as those of sulphonamides. The common adverse effects are skin rashes and 

378PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES
gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances. Exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme and Stevens–Johnson syndrome are rare. GI symptoms include nausea, vomiting, glossitis and stomatitis. Megaloblastic anaemia due to folate deﬁciency may occur rarely, especially in alcoholics  and malnourished persons. Bone marrow suppression with leucopenia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurs rarely. Cotrimoxazole is contraindicated in pregnancy.The preparations of cotrimoxazole are shown in Table 11.3.Therapeutic Uses 1 .  Urinary tract infection (UTI): Cotrimoxazole is effective for the treatment of acute uncomplicated lower UTIs due to gram-negative organisms such as E. coli, Proteus and Enterobacter spp. The usual dose is 800 mg sulphamethoxazole plus 160 mg of trimethoprim (cotrimoxazole double-strength tablet) b.d. for 3 days.  It is useful for chronic and recurrent lower UTIs especially in women. Small doses of cotrimoxazole daily or thrice weekly are used for long-term prophylaxis in  recurrent UTI. Cotrimoxazole can be used in the treatment of bacterial prostatitis as it is concentrated in prostatic tissue. 2. Respiratory tract infections: Cotrimoxazole is useful for acute and chronic bron-chitis due to H. inﬂuenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. It is also useful for acute maxillary sinusitis and otitis media. 3. Bacterial diarrhoeas: Cotrimoxazole may be used for GI infections due to Shigella, E. coli and Salmonella spp. But FQs are the preferred agents. 4 .  Pneumocystis jiroveci infection: High doses of cotrimoxazole are used for treatment of infection due to P. jiroveci in immunocompromised patients. It is useful for treat-ment as well as prophylaxis of P. j i r o v e c i p n e u m o n i a .  P e n t a m i d i n e ,  c l i n d a m y c i n ,  primaquine and atovaquone are the alternative drugs for P. jiroveci infection. 5. Nocardiosis: Cotrimoxazole has been used in the treatment of infection due to Nocardia spp. 6 .  Chancroid: I t  i s  c a u s e d  b y  H. ducreyi. The drug of choice is azithromycin. Cotri-moxazole is equally effective. The alternative drugs are ceftriaxone and ciproﬂoxacin. 7. Typhoid fever (see p. 382): Fluoroquinolones (ciproﬂoxacin, oﬂoxacin, levoﬂoxa-cin, etc.) or third-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone and cefoperazone) are the treatment of choice for typhoid fever. Cotrimoxazole may also be effective.Quinolones and FluoroquinolonesThe ﬁrst quinolone, nalidixic acid, is a urinary antiseptic. It is effective against gram- negative bacteria including E. coli, Proteus, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Salmonella and Shigella, but not Pseudomonas. Nalidixic acid inhibits DNA gyrase enzyme and interferes with the replication of bacterial DNA.

37911—CHEMOTHERAPYgram-negative bacteria and diarrhoea due to Shigella or Salmonella. The most common adverse effects are related to the GI tract, central nervous system (CNS) and skin.Fluoroquinolones (FQs) are synthetic, ﬂuorinated analogues of nalidixic acid. The important FQs are norﬂoxacin, ciproﬂoxacin, peﬂoxacin (ﬁrst-generation FQs), oﬂoxacin, levoﬂoxacin, gemiﬂoxacin and moxiﬂoxacin (second-generation FQs) (Table 11.4).Mechanism of ActionT opoisomerase IV ingram-positive bacteriaNicking, formationof negative supercoils andresealing of strands of DNA Nicking and separation of daughterDNA strands followingDNA replicationDNA gyrase (topoisomerase II) ingram-negative bacteriaFQs inhibit bacterial DNA synthesis (bactericidal). They inhibit DNA gyrase, thus blocking DNA replication in gram-negative bacteria. Inhibition of topoisomerase IV in gram-positive bacteria prevents separation of replicated DNA.Antibacterial Spectrum Ciproﬂoxacin is the prototype drug. It is highly effective against aerobic gram-negative organisms – E. coli, Enterobacter, Proteus, Klebsiella, Salmonella, Shigella, H. ducreyi, H. inﬂuenzae, N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, V . cholerae and Campylobacter jejuni.It has activity against S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and M. tuberculosis.Most of the anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis, C. difﬁcile, etc. are resistant to ciproﬂoxacin.Newer FQs like levoﬂoxacin, gemiﬂoxacin and moxiﬂoxacin have greater activity against streptococci and some activity against anaerobes.Pharmacokinetics.  Ciproﬂoxacin is administered by oral, i.v. or topical routes. It is well absorbed from the gut, but food delays its absorption. It is widely distributed in the body, and reaches high concentration in kidney, lung, prostatic tissue, bile, macro-phages, etc. It is excreted mainly in urine.Adverse EffectsI The common adverse effects are related to the GI tract, e.g. nausea, vomiting and abdominal discomfort.I CNS effects include headache, dizziness, insomnia, confusion, hallucinations and convulsions.I Hypersensitivity reactions include skin rashes, urticaria, itching, eosinophilia and photosensitivity.I T enosynovitis and tendon rupture can occur especially in athletes.I Moxiﬂoxacin can cause prolongation of QT interval.I FQs are contraindicated in pregnancy.I FQs have caused cartilage damage in immature animals – hence, they should be avoided in young children.Drug Interactions. Ciproﬂoxacin increases the plasma concentration of theophyl-line, warfarin, etc., by inhibiting their metabolism. Nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may potentiate CNS side effects of FQs – confusion, irritability and rarely convulsions may occur. Like tetracyclines, absorption of FQs is reduced by  antacids, ferrous salts and sucralfate.Other FQs have been discussed in Table 11.4.

382PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESBaloﬂoxacin (oral) and pazuﬂoxacin (i.v. infusion) are effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). They are used in nosocomial infections.Uses of Fluoroquinolones 1. UTI: FQs are one of the most commonly used AMAs for UTI. They are effective against gram-negative bacilli, such as E. coli, Proteus and Enterobacter. They also have moderate activity against Pseudomonas infection. FQs are superior to cotrimoxazole for the treatment of UTI. They are also effective for the treatment of bacterial prostatitis as they are concentrated in the prostatic tissue (cipro-ﬂoxacin 750 mg b.d. for 3 weeks for upper UTI). 2. Prostatitis: FQs are used in prostatitis as an alternative to cotrimoxazole. 3. Bacterial diarrhoeas: FQs are effective for a variety of GI infections caused by E. coli, Shigella, Salmonella, etc. For traveller’s diarrhoea (due to E. coli), FQs are as effective as cotrimoxazole. Norﬂoxacin, ciproﬂoxacin or levoﬂoxacin therapy for 3–5 days is adequate. 4. Typhoid fever: Ciproﬂoxacin (750 mg orally b.d. for 10 days) is the preferred drug for treatment of typhoid. It is bactericidal and causes rapid resolution of symptoms. Levoﬂoxacin or oﬂoxacin can also be used. They are also effective in eliminating chronic carrier state of Salmonella typhi when therapy is continued for 4 weeks as they attain effective concentration in bile and intestinal mucosa. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) cases are treated with ceftriaxone (2 g i.v. for 7 days) or azithromycin (500 mg orally daily for 7 days). 5. Sexually transmitted diseasesI Gonococcal infections: FQs were effective for the treatment of cervicitis and urethritis caused by N. gonorrhoeae but their use has declined because of high rates of resistance.I Chancroid: Ciproﬂoxacin in a dose of 500 mg b.d. for 3 days is effective.I Chlamydial cervicitis and urethritis can be treated with levoﬂoxacin or oﬂoxacin. 6. Skin, soft-tissue and bone infections due to S. aureus and gram-negative bacilli require prolonged antimicrobial therapy. FQs can be used in combination with an agent effective against anaerobes especially in diabetic foot infections. 7. Ciproﬂoxacin can be used to eradicate meningococci from nasopharynx, thus eliminating the carrier state, but the preferred drug is rifampin. 8. Mycobacterial infections: In MDR-TB, atypical mycobacterial infections, MAC infection in AIDS patients and leprosy, FQs are used in combination with other AMAs. 9 .  Prophylaxis and treatment of infections in neutropenic patients: FQs can be used. 10. Ciproﬂoxacin, levoﬂoxacin, moxiﬂoxacin and oﬂoxacin are used topically for conjunctivitis due to susceptible organisms. 11. Respiratory infections: Newer FQs (levoﬂoxacin and moxiﬂoxacin) are highly effective for community-acquired pneumonia and chronic bronchitis. 12. Anthrax: Ciproﬂoxacin is the preferred drug for treatment and prophylaxis of anthrax./H9252-Lactam Antibiotics/H9252-Lactam antibiotics include penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems and mono-bactams. All of them have a /H9252-lactam ring in their chemical structure (Fig. 11.5), hence the name /H9252-lactam antibiotics.

38311—CHEMOTHERAPY
PenicillinsPenicillin was the ﬁrst antibiotic developed and used clinically. It was discovered acci-dentally by Alexander Fleming. The source of penicillin is the high-yielding Penicillium chrysogenum.Mechanism of Action (Fig. 11.6).  /H9252-Lactam antibiotics produce bactericidal effect by inhibiting cell wall synthesis in susceptible bacteria.Bacterial cell wall is composed of peptidoglycan which contains amino sugars,  N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG). The enzyme, trans-peptidase (a PBP), removes terminal alanine of one strand resulting in its linkage with glycine of adjacent strand. Cross-linking makes the cell wall rigid and stable./H9252-Lactams, the structural analogues of d-alanine, inhibit transpeptidase, thus inhib-iting cross-linking of peptidoglycans and cell wall synthesis. Cell wall–deﬁcient forms are produced which undergo lysis (bactericidal action). /H9252-Lactams exert their cidal effect when the bacteria are actively multiplying and synthesizing cell wall.PBPs, consisting of transpeptidase, other enzymes and related proteins, are located in the cell membrane of bacteria. The cell wall in gram-positive bacteria is composed mainly of highly cross-linked peptidoglycan, which is 50–100 layers thick and is near  the cell surface. In gram-negative bacteria, the peptidoglycan layer is only one to two molecules thick. In addition, there is an outer lipopolysaccharide layer. Hence, gram-negative organisms are less susceptible to penicillin than gram-positive organisms.Mechanism of Bacterial Resistance to Penicillins.

Most of the orally administered penicillin G is destroyed by gastric acid (acid labile); hence, penicillin G is usually given by i.v. route. It can also  be administered by i.m. route but is painful. Penicillin G is widely distributed in body tissues, but poorly crosses BBB, although during meningitis, adequate amount reaches the CSF. Penicillin G is rapidly excreted in urine mainly by active tubular secretion.  Since renal function is not completely developed in infants and neonates, excretion of penicillins is slow. The action of penicillins can be augmented and prolonged by giving probenecid simultaneously.Preparations of Penicillin G.  The duration of action of penicillin G is increased by combining it with poorly water-soluble compounds, such as procaine (procaine penicil-lin G) or benzathine (benzathine penicillin G) to yield aqueous suspensions. They are called repository or depot penicillins (Table 11.5 and Fig. 11.7).Adverse Reactions.  Penicillins are relatively safe. They may cause hypersensitivity reactions, such as skin rashes, urticaria, fever, dermatitis, bronchospasm, angioedema, joint pain, serum sickness or anaphylactic reaction.The major manifestations of anaphylactic shock are severe hypotension, broncho-spasm and laryngeal oedema. It is an immunoglobulin E (IgE)–mediated, immediate type of hypersensitivity reaction (type I hypersensitivity). It is not a dose-related adverse PenicillinRoute and doseDuration  of actionSpecial features 1.

drug reaction and can occur with any dosage form of penicillin. Cross-reactivity can occur among penicillins and also among /H9252-lactam antibiotics.Treatment of Anaphylactic Shock 1. Inj. adrenaline 0.3–0.5 mL of 1:1000 solution intramuscularly 2. Inj. hydrocortisone 200 mg intravenously 3. Inj. diphenhydramine 50–100 mg intravenously or intramuscularlyPrecautions 1. Before giving penicillin, history of previous administration and allergic manifes-tations, if any, must be noted. 2. In patients with history of asthma, allergic rhinitis, hay fever, etc., there is an increased risk of penicillin allergy; hence, it should be avoided in such cases. 3. Sensitivity test should be performed by an intradermal test on the ventral aspect of forearm. Itching, erythema and wheal formation are watched for. A negative skin test does not ensure absolute safety. 4. Inj. adrenaline and hydrocortisone should be kept ready before injecting penicillin to treat the anaphylactic reaction.Other adverse effects of penicillins are pain and sterile abscess at the site of i.m. injection. Prolonged use of i.v. penicillin G may cause thrombophlebitis.Jarisch–Herxheimer Reaction.  It is an acute exacerbation of signs and symptoms of syphilis during penicillin therapy due to release of endotoxins from the dead organisms. The manifestations are fever, chills, myalgia, hypotension, circulatory collapse, etc. It is treated with aspirin and corticosteroids.Therapeutic Uses.  Owing to the risk of anaphylaxis as well as availability of better AMAs, the use of penicillin G has declined. For uses of PnG, see pp. 387 to 389.Limitations/Drawbacks of Penicillin G 1. Acid labile – orally not very effective 2. Short duration of action (to overcome this, repository penicillins have been developed) 3 .

Adverse Effects.  They are similar to those of penicillin G. Congestive cardiac failure may be precipitated due to sodium content of carbenicillin sodium. It can also interfere with platelet function and cause bleeding.Therapeutic Uses of Penicillins 1.  Streptoccocal Infections. Ampicillin and amoxicillin (Table 11.7) are effective for pharyngitis, sinusitis, otitis media, bronchitis, etc., caused by S. pyogenes, S. pneu-moniae and H. inﬂuenzae. Among oral /H9252-lactams, amoxicillin is the most effective agent against penicillin-sensitive and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae.Rheumatic Fever.  The causative organism is group A /H9252-haemolytic Streptococcus. Procaine penicillin G 600,000 units i.m., once daily for 10 days, or benzathine penicillin G 1,200,000 units i.m. as a single dose is used for the treatment of rheumatic fever. For rheumatic fever prophylaxis, inj. benzathine penicillin G is the ideal agent. It is given in a dose of 1.2 million units i.m., once a month and continued for lifetime in high-risk people. Patients allergic to penicillin are treated with erythromycin or sulphadiazine.

388PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES
 Subacute bacterial endocarditis (SABE): Ampicillin in combination with gentami-cin has been used for the treatment of SABE. Amoxicillin is the most commonly used AMA for prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis. 2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): Fluoroquinolones are the preferred AMAs for UTIs. Ampicillin /H11001 gentamicin is useful in E. coli pyelonephritis. 3 .  Meningitis: At present, third-generation cephalosporins along with vancomy-cin are the drugs of choice for treatment of meningitis caused by S. pneumoniae or N .  m en i n gi ti d i s, as the organisms have developed resistance to ampicillin. But ampicillin is very effective for meningitis due to Listeria monocytogenes in immunocompromised patients. Hence, the combination of ampicillin,  vancomycin and third-generation cephalosporin is used for empirical therapy of bacterial meningitis. 4. Bacillary dysentery: FQs are the drugs of choice. Some cases may respond to ampicillin, but many strains have developed resistance to it. 5. Typhoid fever: A FQ or ceftriaxone is the drug of choice for typhoid. Ampicillin, cotrimoxazole or ciproﬂoxacin is useful for eradicating carrier state. 6 .  Syphilis: Penicillin G is the drug of choice for syphilis. T. pallidum is very sensitive to penicillin and is killed at very low concentration of the drug. Procaine penicillin G/benzathine penicillin G is used for the treatment of early syphilis. For late syphilis, benzathine penicillin G is used. The alternative drugs are ceftriaxone, azithromycin and doxycycline. Penicillin is the drug of choice for treatment of syphilis in  pregnancy. 7 .  Diphtheria: It is an acute infection of upper respiratory tract caused by C. diphtheriae. It is treated mainly with the speciﬁc antitoxin. Penicillin G helps to eliminate carrier state. Patients allergic to penicillin are treated with erythromycin. 8. Clostridial infections (tetanus and gas gangrene): The main treatment is neutralization of the toxin by using human tetanus immunoglobulin. For gas gangrene, penicillin G is used as an adjunct to antitoxin. 9 . Gonococcal infections: Penicillin was the drug of choice for gonococcal infections. Am-picillin with probenecid is effective against non-penicillinase-producing gonococcus. AmpicillinAmoxicillinSemisynthetic, aminopenicillinSemisynthetic, aminopenicillinAcid stable; incompletely absorbed from the GI tract – alters intestinal ﬂora; hence,  diarrhoea is more common (superinfection)Acid stable, completely absorbed from  the GI tract; hence, the incidence of  diarrhoea is lessFood decreases the absorption of ampicillinFood does not decrease the absorption of amoxicillinEffective against Shigella and H. inﬂuenzaeLess effective against Shigella and H. inﬂuenzaeAmpicillin reduces the effectiveness of oral contraceptivesDoes not reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptivesDose: Ampicillin 250–500 mg q.i.d.Dose: Amoxicillin 250–500 mg t.i.d.GI, gastrointestinal.Table 11.7  Comparison between ampicillin and amoxicillin

38911—CHEMOTHERAPYBecause of the emergence of resistant organisms, penicillins are not preferred at pres-ent. Third-generation cephalosporins, ceftriaxone or ceﬁxime are the drugs of choice for uncomplicated gonococcal infections. 10. Other infections: Leptospirosis, anthrax, Lyme disease, actinomycosis, rat-bite fever, etc., are effectively treated with penicillin G. 1 1 .  Anaerobic infections: Amoxicillin/ampicillin/penicillin V is used in combination with metronidazole for treatment of acute necrotizing gingivitis (trench mouth). 12. H. pylori infection: Amoxicillin is used in combination with other drugs. 1 3 .  Serious infections: Bacteraemias, pneumonias, UTI, burns, etc., by P . aeruginosa and Proteus are more effectively treated with piperacillin/ticarcillin than by carbenicillin. Carbenicillin indanyl is used orally for the treatment of UTI caused by P . aeruginosa and Proteus spp. Ticarcillin is used in combination with /H9252-lactamase inhibitor and an aminoglycoside for the treatment of mixed nosocomial infection.Drug interactions of penicillins: Probenecid competes with /H9252-lactams (penicillins and cephalosporins) for active tubular secretion and retards their excretion, thereby increasing the plasma concentration as well as the duration of action of /H9252-lactams. Hence, simultaneous administration of probenecid and penicillin is useful in the treat-ment of bacterial endocarditis and gonococcal infections to enhance the therapeutic efﬁcacy of /H9252-lactams./H9252-Lactamase Inhibitors (Ta b l e 11.8).  They are clavulanic acid, sulbactam and tazobac-tam. They structurally resemble /H9252-lactam molecules. /H9252-Lactamase inhibitors bind to /H9252-lactamases and inactivate them. Coadministration of these drugs with /H9252-lactams increases the activity of /H9252-lactams by preventing them from enzymatic destruction.Clavulanic Acid.  It is isolated from Streptomyces clavuligerus. It competitively and irreversibly inhibits /H9252-lactamases produced by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. After binding to the enzyme, clavulanic acid itself gets  inactivated, hence called a ‘suicide’ inhibitor.Preparation  (brand name)Route(s) of  administrationUses 1. Clavulanic acid /H11001 amoxicillinOral, i.m., i.v.Skin, soft-tissue, otitis media, respiratory  and urinary tract infections caused by  /H9252-lactamase-producing strains of S. aureus, E. coli, H. inﬂuenzae and gonococci 2.

390PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESCephalosporinsThe ﬁrst cephalosporins were obtained from a fungus, Cephalosporium acremonium. Later, semisynthetic cephalosporins were developed. Cephalosporins are /H9252-lactam antibiotics with 7-aminocephalosporanic acid nucleus. The mechanism of action and development of resistance are similar to those of penicillins. Like penicillins, cephalo-sporins also inhibit synthesis of bacterial cell wall and produce bactericidal effect. Cephalosporins have been divided into ﬁve generations.Important features of ﬁrst, second, third and fourth generation cephalosporins have been described in Table 11.9.Fifth-generation cephalosporins: They are ceftaroline fosamil (i.v.) and ceftobip-role medocaril (i.v.). Both are prodrugs. They are active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria including MRSA, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, Enterococ-cus fecalis, etc. They are indicated for treatment of complicated skin and soft-tissue infections and community-acquired pneumonia caused by resistant organisms.Pharmacokinetics.  Cephalosporins are administered either orally or parenterally (Table 11.9). These drugs are excreted mainly unchanged through kidney by either glomerular ﬁltration or tubular secretion. Some cephalosporins are metabolized in the body before their excretion. Cefotaxime is deacetylated in the body before its excretion. Cefoperazone is mainly excreted through bile. Like penicillins, the active tubular  secretion of cephalosporins is blocked by probenecid, resulting in higher blood levels and longer duration of action.Adverse Effects 1. Hypersensitivity: The most common adverse effects are allergic reactions. They are skin rashes, urticaria and rarely anaphylaxis. Cross-reactivity to penicillin is seen in few patients. 2. GI disturbances mainly diarrhoea, vomiting and anorexia can also occur. 3. Pain at the site of i.m. injection mainly with cephalothin. Intravenous cephalospo-rins can cause thrombophlebitis. 4. Nephrotoxicity is also seen, particularly with cephaloridine, because of which it has been withdrawn. Coadministration of cephalothin and gentamicin increases the risk of nephrotoxicity. 5. Intolerance to alcohol (a disulﬁram-like reaction) has been reported with cefotetan and cefoperazone. 6. Severe bleeding can occur due to either hypoprothrombinaemia (which responds to vitamin K therapy) or thrombocytopenia and/or platelet dysfunction, espe-cially in patients with renal failure.

39311—CHEMOTHERAPYCarbapenemsExamples are imipenem, meropenem, doripenem, ertapenem and faropenem.IMIPENEMImipenem is a semisynthetic /H9252-lactam antibiotic. Imipenem, like other /H9252-lactam antibi-otics, acts by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis and produces bactericidal activity. It has a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity – gram-positive organisms like streptococci, staphylococci, enterococci, Listeria and C. difﬁcile (anaerobe); and gram-negative organ-isms like P. aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae and B. fragilis (anaerobes). It is resistant to most /H9252-lactamases.

Hence, it is combined with imipenem. Imipenem–cilastatin combination  increases the antibacterial efﬁcacy.Imipenem may exhibit cross-reactivity with penicillins and cephalosporins. Nausea, vom-iting and skin rashes are the common side effects and, rarely, seizures have also been reported.OTHER CARBAPENEMSMeropenem and DoripenemI Injected intravenouslyI Not destroyed by dehydropeptidase – does not require cilastatin coadministrationI Seizures less likelyI Also effective against imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosaErtapenemI Is administered parenterally (i.v. and i.m.)I Has longer half-life than those of imipenem and meropenem – once-daily dose is usedI Less effective against P. aeruginosaFaropenemI Orally effectiveUSES OF CARBAPENEMSThey are used for treatment of hospital-acquired infections – skin and soft-tissue,  genitourinary, respiratory, abdominal infections, etc. Dose of carbapenems should be reduced in patients with renal failure.

394PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESMonobactamsAztreonam is a /H9252-lactam antibiotic with only one ring in its structure, hence the name monobactam. It also acts by inhibiting the bacterial cell wall synthesis. It is effective only against gram-negative bacteria, such as Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, gonococci and H. inﬂuenzae, but has no activity against gram-positive bacteria and anaerobes. It is resistant to most /H9252-lactamases. It is administered only parenterally (i.m., i.v.). The main advantage with aztreonam is lack of cross-reactivity with other /H9252-lactam antibiotics (except with ceftazidime). It is useful for treatment of hospital-acquired gram-negative infections (genitourinary, intra-abdominal, etc.).AminoglycosidesThey include streptomycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, kanamycin, sisomicin, neomycin, framycetin, netilmicin and paromomycin.Common Properties of Aminoglycosides 1 .  They contain two or more amino sugars attached by glycosidic linkage to hexose ring. 2. They are highly polar compounds, hence poorly absorbed from the GI tract. They are administered by parenteral route (i.m./i.v.) for systemic effect. 3 .  They are mainly distributed into extracellular ﬂuid and poorly penetrate into the CSF. 4. They are not metabolized in the body. 5. They are excreted unchanged in urine. 6. They have bactericidal action against gram-negative aerobes and are more active at alkaline pH. 7. They cause ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. 8. They exhibit partial cross-resistance among them. 9. Transport of aminoglycosides into the bacterial cell requires oxygen; hence, anaerobes are resistant to aminoglycosides.Mechanism of Action.  Aminoglycosides are bactericidal agents – inhibit protein synthesis.Bind to 3OS ribosomal subunitEntry of aminoglycosides into bacterial cell (O2 is required)Inhibit initiationof protein synthesisCause misreading of codonInsertion of wrong amino acidinto the growing peptide chainsPremature termination ofprotein synthesisIncorporation of defective proteins into bacterial cell membraneAltered permeability and disruption of cell membrane (bactericidal effect)Formation of defective proteins

39511—CHEMOTHERAPYMechanisms of Bacterial Resistance.  Bacterial resistance to aminoglycosides is due to (i) inactivation of the drug by bacterial enzymes, (ii) decreased entry of drug into bacterial cell and (iii) decreased afﬁnity of the drug for the ribosomes.Aminoglycosides Exhibit 1. A concentration-dependent killing effect – higher the plasma concentration, more of the bacteria killed rapidly. 2. A postantibiotic effect – bactericidal effect is present even when serum concentra-tion falls below MIC. Therefore, once-daily dosing regimen is effective.Dosing 1. Once-daily dosing regimen – total daily dose is given as a single injection. It is preferred because it:I Is as effective as multiple-dose regimen. Higher peak plasma concentration is achieved following single dose.I Is safer than multiple-dose regimen. The plasma trough concentration of amino-glycosides remains below threshold levels for toxicity for a long period of time.I Is convenient. 2. Multiple-daily dosing regimen – the total daily dose is administered in two or three equally divided doses.Once-daily dosing regimen is not preferred in bacterial endocarditis, children and patients with renal impairment. Dose adjustment of aminoglycosides is done according to body weight and creatinine clearance.Adverse Effects 1 .  Ototoxicity: V estibular and cochlear dysfunctions can occur due to VIII cranial nerve damage. Aminoglycosides get concentrated in the perilymph and endolymph of the inner ear which can lead to progressive damage to vestibular and cochlear hair cells. Streptomycin and gentamicin mainly affect vestibular function. V estibular dysfunction causes intense headache (earliest symptom), dizziness, nausea, vomit-ing, vertigo, nystagmus and ataxia. Amikacin and kanamycin affect auditory func-tion, causing more cochlear damage. The manifestations of cochlear damage are tinnitus (reversible on discontinuation of the drug) and deafness (permanent).The important risk factors for ototoxicity are the following: (a) Elderly patients (b) Repeated courses of aminoglycosides (c) Persistently increased concentration of the drug in plasma (d) Patients with preexisting auditory impairment (e) Concurrent use of other ototoxic drugs, such as vancomycin, minocycline and loop diuretics 2. Nephrotoxicity: Aminoglycosides get concentrated in renal cortex and produce nephrotoxicity, which is usually reversible on discontinuation of the drug.  The incidence of nephrotoxicity is highest with neomycin and least with strepto-mycin. There is a decrease in urinary concentrating capacity, albuminuria, etc.  The risk factors for nephrotoxicity are elderly patients, preexisting renal disease and concurrent use of other nephrotoxic drugs, such as AMB, vancomycin,  cisplatin and cyclosporine. 3 .  Neuromuscular blocking effect: Apnoea and muscular paralysis have been reported. It may be reversed by administration of calcium salt. Aminoglycosides inhibit release of acetylcholine from motor nerve. Myasthenic patients are more susceptible to neu-romuscular blocking effect of these drugs; hence, they should be avoided.

396PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES 4. Hypersensitivity reactions are rare; occasionally skin rashes, drug fever and eosinophilia can occur. Cross-sensitivity between aminoglycosides may occur. 5. Use of aminoglycosides during pregnancy may cause ototoxicity in fetus.STREPTOMYCINStreptomycin was the ﬁrst aminoglycoside discovered in 1944. The common properties, mechanism of action and adverse effects are explained above.Uses.  Streptomycin is one of the ﬁrst-line drugs for TB and is used in combination with other antitubercular drugs. The other uses include tularaemia, plague and brucellosis.GENTAMICINIt is the most commonly used aminoglycoside antibiotic for aerobic gram-negative  bacillary infections due to E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus, Enterobacter and P. aeruginosa. It is also effective against gram-positive infections – enterococci, S. viridans and staphylo-cocci but not M. tuberculosis. It is available for parenteral and topical administration. Common properties, mechanism of action and adverse effects are discussed above.NEOMYCINIt is highly nephrotoxic, hence never used for systemic effect. It is used only for local effect. The common properties, mechanism of action and adverse effects are as for other aminoglycosides.Uses of NeomycinI Topically (a) Infections of the skin and mucous membranes: Ulcers, wounds and burns. (b) Infections of the eye and external ear: Neomycin is often used in combination with bacitracin or polymyxin B.I Orally (for local action) (a) Neomycin sulphate is useful in combination with erythromycin base for preparation of bowel before abdominal surgery. (b) Hepatic encephalopathy: Neomycin, on oral administration, reduces blood ammonia level by destroying the colonic bacteria. Neomycin is highly toxic; hence, it has been replaced by oral lactulose, which is preferred for hepatic encephalopathy.FRAMYCETIN (SOFRAMYCIN)Like neomycin, framycetin is also highly nephrotoxic, hence not used for systemic  administration. The common properties, mechanism of action and adverse effects  are similar to those of other aminoglycosides. Framycetin is widely used topically for skin, eye and ear infections.AMIKACINAmong the aminoglycosides, it has the broadest spectrum of activity. It is resistant to aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes. It is useful for the treatment of nosocomial gram-negative infections and tuberculosis.

39711—CHEMOTHERAPYTOBRAMYCINAll features are similar to those of gentamicin. It is superior to gentamicin against  P. aeruginosa – useful in the treatment of serious infection by this organism.PAROMOMYCINIt is an aminoglycoside with activity against protozoans. It can be used in intestinal amoe-biasis, giardiasis, vaginal trichomoniasis, visceral leishmaniasis and hepatic encephalopathy.NETILMICINIt is resistant to aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes, hence effective against most of the gentamicin-resistant bacteria.THERAPEUTIC USES OF GENTAMICIN AND OTHER AMINOGLYCOSIDESAmong aminoglycosides, gentamicin is the most commonly used because it is cheap  and effective against most of the aerobic gram-negative bacilli. 1. Severe aerobic gram-negative bacillary infectionsUrinary tract infection with pyelonephritis IPneumonia IMeningitis IOsteomyelitis  I/H20903Due to Pseudomonas, Klebsiella,Septicaemia  IE. coli, Proteus, etc.Peritonitis  IInfected burns II Gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin and netilmicin are effective against P. aeruginosa.I Amikacin and netilmicin are used for treatment of serious nosocomial infections due to gram-negative bacilli.I Aminoglycosides are often used in combination with penicillins/third-generation cephalosporins in these conditions. 2. Bacterial endocarditis due to S. viridans and Enterococcus: Gentamicin is used in combination with a penicillin or vancomycin. Combination broadens the spec-trum of activity, produces synergistic effect and decreases emergence of resistance.I Penicillin G /H11001 gentamicin for S. viridans.I Ampicillin /H11001 gentamicin for Enterococcus.I Vancomycin /H11001 gentamicin for Enterococcus (patients allergic to /H9252-lactam antibiotics).I Gentamicin and ampicillin combination is also used for the prophylaxis of endocarditis in high-risk patients before surgical procedures. 3. TB: Streptomycin, kanamycin and amikacin are used in the treatment of TB. 4. Other gram-negative infectionsI Plague: Streptomycin/gentamicin is used intramuscularly.I Brucellosis: Streptomycin/gentamicin is used in combination with doxycycline.I Tularaemia: Streptomycin or gentamicin is the drug of choice. FQs and tetracyclines are also effective. 5. Gentamicin, tobramycin, neomycin, sisomicin, framycetin, etc., are used topically for gram-negative skin, eye and ear infections.

398PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESBroad-Spectrum AntibioticsT etracyclines and chloramphenicol are broad-spectrum antibiotics. They are so called because of their effectiveness against a wide range of microorganisms, such as:I Gram-positive and gram-negative cocci – S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, N. gonorrhoeaeI Gram-negative bacilli – V. c h o l e ra e, H. ducreyi, H. inﬂuenzae, H. pylori, Campylobacter, Yersinia pest isI Gram-positive bacilli – B. anthracis, Listeria, Clostridia, Propionibacterium acnesI Others – Rickettsiae, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Spirochetes, Actinomyces, Plasmodia, Entamoeba histolyticaTetracyclinesT etracyclines have four cyclic rings in their structure (Fig. 11.8).Mechanism of ActionT etracyclinesActively taken up by susceptible bacteriaBind reversibly to  3OS ribosomal subunitPrevent binding of aminoacyl tRNA tomRNA–ribosome complexPrevent the addition of amino acid to the growing peptide chainInhibit bacterial protein synthesis (bacteriostatic)Resistance.  Bacterial resistance to tetracyclines is due to: (i) decreased inﬂux or increased efﬂux of tetracyclines and (ii) inactivation of the drug by enzymes.Pharmacokinetics.  The older tetracyclines are incompletely absorbed after oral adminis-tration (Table 11.10), but that is adequate to produce antibacterial activity. Food interferes with the absorption of all tetracyclines; doxycycline and minocycline are less affected.  T etracyclines have chelating property, hence form stable insoluble and unabsorbable  complexes with calcium, magnesium, iron and other metal ions. Therefore, the absorption of tetracyclines is reduced by simultaneous administration with dairy products, antacids, iron, sucralfate and zinc salts. T etracyclines are widely distributed throughout the body, and get concentrated in liver, spleen, bone, dentine, enamel of unerupted teeth but concentration in CSF is relatively low. They cross placental barrier, and are metabolized in liver and excreted in urine. Doxycycline is excreted mainly in the faeces via bile. Therefore, doxycycline is safe for use in patients with renal insufﬁciency. Doxycycline undergoes enterohepatic cycling.OH O OCOHNH2H3C OHN(CH3)2OHOHABAAEHBOBOAFig. 11.8 Basic structure of tetracycline.

39911—CHEMOTHERAPY
Adverse Effects 1. GI: On oral administration, they can cause GI irritation manifested as nausea, vomiting, epigastric distress, abdominal discomfort and diarrhoea. Diarrhoea  is more common with tetracycline and oxytetracycline as they are incompletely absorbed n cause alteration of normal ﬂora. Risk of diarrhoea is low with doxycycline. 2. Phototoxicity: It is particularly seen with demeclocycline and doxycycline. They may also produce sunburn-like reaction in the skin on exposure to sunlight. They may also produce pigmentation of nails. 3. Hepatotoxicity: Acute hepatic necrosis with fatty changes is common in patients receiving high doses (/H110222 g/day) intravenously. It is more likely to occur in pregnant women. 4. Renal toxicity: Demeclocycline may produce nephrogenic diabetes insipidus by blocking the action of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) on collecting duct. This effect of demeclocycline has been used therapeutically in patients with syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).Fanconi syndrome: Use of outdated tetracyclines may damage proximal renal tubules – the patient may present with nausea, vomiting, polyuria, proteinuria, acidosis, etc. 5. Superinfection: It is common with older tetracyclines because of their incomplete absorption in the gut; they cause alteration of the gut ﬂora. Superinfection occurs with organisms like Candida, Proteus, Pseudomonas and C. difﬁcile. Pseudomem-branous colitis caused by C. difﬁcile is a serious complication. It is characterized by severe diarrhoea, fever, abdominal pain and stool mixed with blood and mucus, which is treated with oral metronidazole. 6. Effects on bones and teeth: T etracyclines have calcium chelating property and form tetracycline–calcium orthophosphate complex which is deposited in  growing bone and teeth. Use of tetracyclines in children and during pregnancy  can cause permanent brownish discolouration of deciduous teeth due to deposi-tion of chelate in the teeth. There is increased incidence of caries in such teeth. T etracyclines also affect the linear growth of bones. The incidence of hepatotoxic-ity is more in pregnant women. Therefore, tetracyclines are contraindicated dur-ing pregnancy in the interest of both fetus and mother. It is also contraindicated in children up to the age of 8 years. 7. They may cause increased intracranial pressure (pseudotumour cerebri) in infants. 8. Hypersensitivity reactions: Skin rashes, fever, urticaria, exfoliative dermatitis, etc., may occur rarely. Cross-sensitivity among tetracyclines is common.DrugsRoute of  administrationAbsorption from the gutHalf-life,  t½ (hours)DosageOxytetracycline TetracyclineOral, i.v., topicalOral, topicalIncomplete6–12 250–500 mg q.i.d.DemeclocyclineOralIncomplete16–18 300–600 mg b.d.DoxycyclineMinocyclineOral, i.v.OralHigh18–24 100 mg b.d. or o.d.Table 11.10  Important features of tetracyclines

400PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESTherapeutic Uses 1. Rickettsial infections: T etracyclines are the ﬁrst-choice drugs for the treatment of rickettsial infections – epidemic typhus, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, scrub typhus, rickettsial pox and Q fever. Doxycycline 100 mg b.d. is given orally or intravenously for 5–7 days. 2. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections: Doxycycline has good activity against Mycoplasma – used to shorten the duration of illness. It is a ﬁrst choice drug in atypical pneumonia due to M. pneumoniae. 3. Chlamydial infectionsLymphogranuloma venereum: It is a sexually transmitted infection caused by C. trachomatis. Doxycycline is the drug of choice. In complicated cases (i.e. pelvic inﬂammatory disease), doxycycline 100 mg b.d. should be continued for 21 days. Macrolides are also effective.Chlamydial urethritis and granuloma inguinale: Doxycycline is highly effective and is the drug of choice.Psittacosis: Doxycycline is the preferred agent; treatment should be continued for 2 weeks to prevent relapse. 4. Cholera: Fluid and electrolyte replacement is the mainstay of therapy. Single dose of tetracycline 2 g or doxycycline 300 mg is effective in adults. It reduces the stool volume. 5. Brucellosis: Treatment of choice is a combination of doxycycline with rifampin/gentamicin/streptomycin. 6. Plague: Doxycycline is highly effective for treatment of plague. 7 .  As an alternative drug: For treatment of leptospirosis (doxycycline is an alternative to penicillins), pneumonia due to Chlamydia pneumoniae (doxycycline alternative to azithromycin), tularaemia (alternative to streptomycin, gentamicin), etc. 8. Acne: Low doses of tetracyclines are used.LipidsFree fatty acids (irritant)Propionibacteria/H17053Tetracyclines act by inhibiting propionibacteria, thereby prevent the formation of free fatty acids. 9. Malaria: Doxycycline is used in combination with other antimalarial agents for treatment of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum malaria. It is used alone for malarial chemoprophylaxis. 10. Amoebiasis: See p. 452. 11. SIADH: Demeclocycline has anti-ADH action; hence, it is used in SIADH to promote diuresis. 1 2 .  Leprosy: It is one of the components in ROM (rifampin, oﬂoxacin and minocycline) regimen for single-lesion paucibacillary leprosy (PBL). 13. Filariasis: Doxycycline is given orally in ﬁlarial infection.Advantages of Doxycycline over Tetracycline 1. It can be administered orally as well as intravenously. 2. It is highly potent. 3. It is completely absorbed after oral administration. 4. Food does not interfere with its absorption.

40111—CHEMOTHERAPY 5. It has a longer duration of action (t½ – 24 hours); requires less frequent dosing subscript 6. Incidence of diarrhoea is rare as it does not affect the intestinal ﬂora. 7. It can be safely given to patients with renal failure, as it is excreted primarily in bile.TigecyclineThe spectrum of activity of tigecycline is similar to that of tetracyclines. It is also  effective against organisms resistant to tetracyclines. Mycobacteria are also susceptible. Tigecycline has a long half-life. It is administered intravenously. Adverse effects include nausea and vomiting. It can cause brown discolouration of the teeth in children. It is useful in serious skin, soft-tissue and intra-abdominal infections.ChloramphenicolChloramphenicol, a broad-spectrum antibiotic; was isolated from Streptomyces venezuelae. Even though chloramphenicol has a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, its use is limited to only a few conditions because of its dangerous side effect – bone marrow suppression.Mechanism of ActionChloramphenicolBinds reversibly to50S ribosomal subunitPrevents the formation ofpeptide bondInhibits protein synthesisChloramphenicol is a bacteriostatic agent, but in high concentration, it can be bactericidal against H. inﬂuenzae, N. meningitidis and S. pneumoniae. It can also inhibit mitochondrial protein synthesis in mammalian cells by acting on 70S ribosomes.Resistance to chloramphenicol is caused by: 1. Production of inactivating enzyme – acetyltransferase, e.g. H. inﬂuenzae, S. typhi, S. aureus 2. Decreased permeability of the microbial cell wall 3. Ribosomal mutationPharmacokinetics.  Chloramphenicol is commonly given by oral route and is rapidly absorbed from the gut. It is also available for parenteral and topical administration.  It has a bitter taste; to improve the taste, chloramphenicol palmitate suspension has  been developed for paediatric use. It gets activated in the intestine by pancreatic lipase. Chloramphenicol is widely distributed to all tissues including CSF and brain. It  also crosses placental barrier and is secreted in milk. It gets metabolized in liver by  glucuronide conjugation and the metabolite is excreted mainly in urine.Adverse Effects.  Most of the adverse effects of chloramphenicol are due to inhibition of mammalian mitochondrial protein synthesis. 1. Hypersensitivity reactions: Skin rashes, drug fever and angioedema may occur rarely. 2. Bone marrow suppression: The most serious adverse effect of chloramphenicol is on bone marrow. It can occur in two ways: (a) Dose-dependent reversible suppression of bone marrow, which manifests as anaemia, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia (b) Idiosyncratic non-dose-related irreversible aplastic anaemia, which is often fatal

402PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES 3. GI effects: These include nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Prolonged use may cause superinfection due to suppression of gut ﬂora. 4 .  Gray baby syndrome: In neonates, especially in premature babies, chloramphenicol can cause a dose-related gray baby syndrome due to reduced degradation and  detoxiﬁcation of the drug in liver because of the deﬁciency of glucuronyl transferase enzyme. The manifestations are nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, diarrhoea, refusal to suck, cyanosis, irritability and circulatory collapse. The skin appears ashen gray colour, hence the name ‘gray baby’ syndrome. Mortality is high. Therefore, chloramphenicol should be avoided in neonates.Drug interactions: Like erythromycin, chloramphenicol increases plasma concentra-tion of certain drugs, such as warfarin, phenytoin, rifabutin and antiretroviral protease inhibitors (PIs), by inhibiting hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.Therapeutic Uses 1. Typhoid fever: Chloramphenicol was the ﬁrst-choice drug for typhoid. Antibiot-ics useful in typhoid are third-generation cephalosporins, FQs, azithromycin, ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, etc. Now, FQs (ciproﬂoxacin, oﬂoxacin, levoﬂoxacin, etc.) or third-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefoperazone) are the  drugs of choice for typhoid fever. The dose of ciproﬂoxacin is 750 mg 12 hourly for 10 days. It also eliminates carrier state. MDR cases are treated with ceftriaxone (2–4 g i.v. daily for 10 days) or azithromycin. 2. Bacterial meningitis: Third-generation cephalosporins are the preferred drugs for the treatment of bacterial meningitis caused by H. inﬂuenzae, N. meningitidis and S. pneumoniae. However, chloramphenicol can be used alone or in combina-tion with ampicillin. 3. Anaerobic infections: Chloramphenicol is effective against most anaerobic bacteria including B. fragilis. It is often used in combination with metronidazole for the treatment of brain, lung, intra-abdominal or pelvic abscesses. 4. Rickettsial infections: T etracyclines are the drugs of choice for the treatment of rickettsial diseases. Chloramphenicol can be used to treat rickettsial infections  in children and pregnant women. 5. Eye and ear infections: Chloramphenicol is used topically for eye and ear infections due to susceptible organisms. 6. Brucellosis: Chloramphenicol can be used when tetracyclines are contraindicated.MacrolidesErythromycin was obtained from Streptomyces erythreus. Roxithromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin are semisynthetic macrolides. Erythromycin is active against S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, N. gonorrhoea, C. perfringens, C. diphtheriae, Listeria, Mycoplasma, Legionella, C. trachomatis, B. pertussis, etc. It is not effective against B. fragilis.Mechanism of Action.  Erythromycin and other macrolides bind to bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit and inhibit protein synthesis. They are bacteriostatic, but at high concentrations, they can act as bactericidal agents. They are more active at alkaline pH.Pharmacokinetics.  Erythromycin is adequately absorbed from the upper GI tract. It is destroyed by gastric acid (acid labile), hence must be administered as Enteric-coated tablets to protect it from gastric acid. Food may delay the absorption of erythromycin. It is widely distributed in the body and reaches therapeutic concentration in prostatic secretions but does not cross BBB. It is partly metabolized in liver and excreted in bile.

40311—CHEMOTHERAPYPreparations of Erythromycin.  They are erythromycin base, Erythromycin Estolate and erythromycin stearate.Adverse Effects 1. The common side effects are related to the GI tract (Enteral toxicity): Nausea, vomiting, epigas-tric pain and diarrhoea. Erythromycin increases GI motility by stimulating motilin receptors in  the gut. 2. Hypersensitivity reactions: Skin rashes, drug fever, eosinophilia and hepatitis with cholestatic jaun-dice, particularly with erythromycin estolate. Incidence of hepatotoxicity is more in pregnant women.ErythromycinEnteric-coated tabletsErythromycin EstolateEnteral toxicity mainlyEnzyme inhibitorDrug Interactions.  Erythromycin and clarithromycin are Enzyme inhibitors, hence increase the blood levels of a number of drugs, such as theophylline, carbamazepine, valproate, warfarin, digoxin and cyclosporine, and potentiate their effects. Erythromycin and clarithromycin can precipitate fatal ventricular arrhythmias when given with cis-apride, astemizole, terfenadine, etc. – such interactions are not seen with azithromycin.Drawbacks of Erythromycin 1. It has a narrow spectrum of antibacterial activity. 2. Its oral bioavailability is low. 3. It has a short duration of action. 4. Poor patient compliance due to GI side effects.T o overcome the above drawbacks, semisynthetic macrolides – roxithromycin,  clarithromycin and azithromycin – have been developed (Table 11.11).CLARITHROMYCIN (Table 11.11)Mechanism of action and spectrum of activity is similar to that of erythromycin. It is administered orally. It achieves high concentration inside the cells. It is also used for the treatment of MAC, leprosy and H. pylori infection.

AZITHROMYCIN (Table 11.11)It can be administered orally and intravenously. Oral administration should be either  1 hour before or 2 hours after food. It does not cross BBB. Azithromycin is more  active against H. inﬂuenzae than erythromycin and clarithromycin (Table 11.11). It is well absorbed, has wide tissue distribution and achieves high intracellular concentra-tion than erythromycin. It is better tolerated and longer acting (single daily dose) than erythromycin.Antibacterial Spectrum and Therapeutic Uses of Macrolides 1. As a drug of choice in the following conditions: (a) M. pneumoniae infections: Azithromycin and clarithromycin are often used for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. Erythromycin can  also be used. (b) Legionnaires’ pneumonia: Macrolides, especially azithromycin, is the drug  of choice because of high tissue concentration, excellent activity, better  tolerability and single daily dosing.

40511—CHEMOTHERAPY (c) Chlamydial infections: Azithromycin is the ﬁrst choice drug in urethritis,  lymphogranuloma venereum and chlamydial pneumonia. Macrolides are preferred for chlamydial infections in children and pregnant women. (d) Diphtheria: Erythromycin is very effective for eliminating the carrier state and for the treatment of acute infection. (e) Pertussis (whooping cough): Erythromycin is most effective for the treatment as well as for prophylaxis of close contacts. Clarithromycin and azithromycin are also effective. (f) Chancroid: Azithromycin is effective as single dose in chancroid. 2. As an alternative drug in patients who are allergic to penicillins/cephalosporins (a) Tetanus: Administration of human tetanus antitoxin, tetanus toxoid, anticon-vulsant (e.g. diazepam) and debridement of wound are important therapeutic measures. A course of oral erythromycin for 10 days may be given to eradicate C. tetani. (b) Streptococcal infections: T onsillitis, pharyngitis, otitis media, cellulitis, pneu-monia, etc., respond to azithromycin and erythromycin. (c) MDR typhoid fever: It is an alternative to cephalosporins. (d) Prophylactic usesI Before surgical procedures to prevent bacterial endocarditis in patients with valvular lesion – azithromycin or clarithromycin can be used.I For prophylaxis of recurrences of rheumatic fever. 3.  Other Uses. For treatment of MAC infections in AIDS patients, azithromycin/clarithromycin is used in combination with other drugs. Clarithromycin is also useful in the treatment of H. pylori infection and leprosy along with other drugs.KETOLIDESKetolides (e.g. telithromycin) are semisynthetic derivatives of erythromycin.I Spectrum of activity and site of action is similar to that of azithromycin. Also effective against some macrolide-resistant organisms.I Used orally for community-acquired pneumonia.I Hepatotoxicity is a serious adverse effect.SPIRAMYCINIt is a macrolide.

Urinary Antiseptics  PH1.48Some AMAs on oral administration attain high concentration only in the urinary tract and exert antibacterial activity locally. They are used to treat infections of the urinary tract and are called urinary antiseptics. Common organisms involved in UTI are E. coli, Proteus, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas.METHENAMINEMethenamine is a prodrug. In acidic urine, it is hydrolyzed to ammonia and formaldehyde.Methenamine(Prodrug)Mandelic acid makes theurine acidic (pH < 5.5)Formaldehyde (Active)(antiseptic) + AmmoniaFormaldehyde inhibits both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms and produces bactericidal activity. It is ineffective against urea-splitting microorganisms (e.g. Proteus spp.) as it increases urinary pH. T o prevent the release of formaldehyde in the stomach, methe-namine is administered as enteric-coated tablets. It is useful mainly for chronic suppressive therapy in recurrent UTI particularly if the causative organism is E. coli. Methenamine is contraindicated in patients with hepatic insufﬁciency because of the release of ammonia. The adverse effects are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and even haematuria with high doses.NITROFURANTOINIt is a bacteriostatic agent and is more active in acidic pH. It is effective for the prophylaxis of UTI due to E. coli. It stains the urine brown. The common adverse effects are nausea, 

410PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESvomiting and diarrhoea. The hypersensitivity reactions include fever, leucopenia,  anaemia, cholestatic jaundice, acute pneumonitis and rarely polyneuropathy.PHENAZOPYRIDINEIt is not an AMA. It is a dye and has analgesic action in urinary tract. It relieves pain, burning, urgency and frequency of urination associated with cystitis. It makes the urine orange red, which is harmless. Occasionally, it may cause nausea and vomiting.Treatment of Urinary Tract InfectionUrinary tract infection (UTI)Lower UTI •   Infection is localized to urethra and bladder•   Short course (3–5 days) of antimicrobial treatment is adequateUpper UTI •   Kidney tissue is also involved (pyelonephritis)•   Prolonged (2–3 weeks) antimicrobial therapy is necessaryTreatment Schedules (Empirical Therapy)Acute CystitisI Ciproﬂoxacin 250–500 mg b.d. oral for 3 daysI Norﬂoxacin 400 mg b.d. oral for 3 daysI Oﬂoxacin 200 mg b.d. oral for 3 daysI Cefpodoxime proxetil 200 mg b.d. for 3–5 daysI Cotrimoxazole DS b.d. oral for 3 daysI Nitrofurantoin 100 mg b.d. for 5 daysAcute PyelonephritisI Ampicillin 1 g q6h i.v. and gentamicin 1 mg/kg q8h i.v. for 3 weeksI Ciproﬂoxacin 750 mg q12h oral for 3 weeksI Oﬂoxacin 200 mg q12h oral for 3 weeksI Cotrimoxazole DS q12h oral for 3 weeksChronic Pyelonephritis.

Injection ceftriaxone is injected intravenously in a dose of 2–4 g daily for 7–10 days. It is also effective to eliminate carrier state.Fluoroquinolones: Ciproﬂoxacin (750 mg orally twice daily for 10 days) is the preferred drug for the treatment of typhoid. It causes rapid resolution of  symptoms. Levoﬂoxacin and oﬂoxacin can also be used. These agents are also  effective in eliminating chronic carrier state of S. typhi, when therapy is continued for 4 weeks, as they attain effective concentration in bile and intestinal mucosa. FQs are contraindicated in children and pregnant women.Azithromycin: It is used in cases of MDR typhoid fever. It is administered orally 500 mg daily for 7 days.Chloramphenicol: It was the ﬁrst choice drug for typhoid. It is no longer used now.Cotrimoxazole: It is rarely used now.Agents Used in Staphylococcal InfectionsPenicillins: Penicillinase-resistant penicillins – methicillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillinCephalosporins: Cefprozil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefepimeCarbapenems: Imipenem, meropenem, faropenem, doripenemTigecyclineAminoglycoside: NetilmicinRifampinMiscellaneous antibiotics: Vancomycin, teicoplanin, clindamycin, streptogramins (quinupristin/dalfopristin), linezolidDrugs for MRSA.

Since TB is a chronic  infection, it consists of excessive ﬁbrous tissue with central necrosis. So vascularity of  the lesion is poor; hence, the penetration of the drug into the lesion is decreased.Classiﬁcation 1. First-line antitubercular drugs (standard drugs): Isoniazid (H), rifampin (R), pyrazinamide (Z), ethambutol (E), streptomycin (S) 2 .

Isoniazid (Isonicotinic Acid Hydrazide [INH]).  Isoniazid is a highly effective and the most widely used antitubercular agent. It is orally effective, cheapest and has tuberculocidal activity. It is active against both intracellular and extracellular bacilli. It is a ﬁrst-line drug for the treatment of TB. It is also used for chemoprophylaxis of TB (see p. 419).Mechanism of Action.  Isoniazid inhibits biosynthesis of mycolic acids, which are essential constituents of the mycobacterial cell wall.InsidemycobacteriaIsoniazid(Prodrug)Converted toactive formDeath ofbacteria(Tuberculocidal)Inhibits the synthesis ofmycolic acids (components of mycobacterialcell wall)Pharmacokinetics.  INH is readily absorbed from the gut, distributed well all over the body, tubercular cavities and body ﬂuids like CSF, and also crosses placental barrier. It is metabolized by acetylation and the metabolites are excreted in urine. The rate  of acetylation of INH is under genetic control resulting in either rapid or slow  acetylators.Uses.  Isoniazid (INH) is a ﬁrst-line drug for the treatment of TB. It is also used for chemoprophylaxis of tuberculosis.

414PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESAdverse Effects and Drug Interactions 1. Hepatotoxicity: The risk of hepatic damage is more in chronic alcoholics, elderly patients and rapid acetylators. It is reversible on discontinuation of the drug.  Patients receiving INH should be monitored for symptoms like anorexia, nausea, vomiting and jaundice. 2. Peripheral neuritis: It is a dose-related toxicity. Isoniazid is structurally similar to pyridoxine; hence, INH competitively interferes with utilization of pyridoxine.  It also promotes the excretion of pyridoxine. Peripheral neuritis is more common in slow acetylators. Pyridoxine 10 mg/day is generally given along with INH to reduce the risk of peripheral neuritis in alcoholics, diabetic patients and HIV-positive patients receiving antitubercular therapy. It is also used for the treatment (100 mg/day) of INH-induced peripheral neuritis. 3. Other side effects are fever, skin rashes, arthralgia, anaemia, GI disturbances, psychosis and rarely convulsions.Isoniazid inhibits the metabolism of phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin, etc. n increases plasma levels of these drugs n may result in toxicity.Rifampin (Rifampicin).  Rifampin is a derivative of rifamycin and is a ﬁrst-line antituber-cular drug. It rapidly kills intracellular and extracellular bacilli including spurters (those residing in caseous lesion). It is the only agent that can act on all types of bacillary sub-populations; hence, it is called sterilizing agent.Mechanism of Action.  Rifampin binds to bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase and inhibits RNA synthesis. It has bactericidal effect against mycobacteria, N. menin-gitidis, H. inﬂuenzae, S. aureus, E. coli, Pseudomonas, etc.Pharmacokinetics.  It is given orally and is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract but presence of food reduces its absorption; it is distributed widely throughout the body and gets metabolized in liver. The active deacetylated form is excreted in bile and undergoes enterohepatic recycling. The rest of the drug is excreted in urine.Uses 1. Tuberculosis: Rifampin is used along with INH and other antitubercular drugs for the treatment of TB. It is also used for chemoprophylaxis of tuberculosis. 2. Leprosy (see p. 420). 3. Prophylaxis of meningococcal and H. inﬂuenzae meningitis: Rifampin reaches high concentration in the nasopharynx and eradicates the carrier state in case  of meningococcal and H. inﬂuenzae infections. It is given orally 600 mg every 12 hours for four doses in adults. In children, the dose of rifampin is 10 mg/kg every 12 hours for four doses. 4. Rifampin, in combination with /H9252-lactam antibiotics, may be useful in staphylo-coccal infections, such as endocarditis and osteomyelitis. 5. Rifampin is used with doxycycline for the treatment of brucellosis.Adverse Effects and Drug Interactions 1 .  Hepatitis is the main adverse effect – the risk of hepatotoxicity is more in alcoholics and elderly patients. 2. Flu-like syndrome with fever, chills, headache, muscle and joint pain. 3. GI disturbances, such as nausea, vomiting and abdominal discomfort. 4. Skin rashes, itching and ﬂushing.It stains various body ﬂuids, such as urine, tears, saliva, sweat and sputum, orange red, which is harmless.

41511—CHEMOTHERAPYRifampin is a potent microsomal enzyme inducer, hence reduces the plasma levels of a number of drugs, such as oral contraceptives (resulting in contraceptive failure), oral anticoagulants, oral antidiabetic drugs, HIV PIs and non-nucleoside reverse  transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). It also induces its own metabolism.Pyrazinamide.  Pyrazinamide is a synthetic analogue of nicotinamide. It is active in acidic pH – effective against intracellular bacilli (has sterilizing activity). It has tuber-culocidal activity. Like INH, pyrazinamide inhibits mycobacterial mycolic acid  biosynthesis but by a different mechanism. It is given orally, absorbed well from the GI tract and distributed widely throughout the body including CSF. It is metabolized in liver and excreted in urine. The most important adverse effect of pyrazinamide  is dose-dependent hepatotoxicity. It impairs the excretion of urates resulting in  hyperuricaemia and may also precipitate acute attacks of gout in susceptible  individuals. The other side effects are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fever and skin rashes.Ethambutol.  It is a ﬁrst-line antitubercular drug. It inhibits arabinosyl transferases that are involved in mycobacterial cell wall synthesis. It is a bacteriostatic drug. It is used in combination with other antitubercular drugs to prevent emergence of resistance and for faster sputum conversion. There is no cross-resistance with other antitubercular drugs. Patients tolerate ethambutol well as it causes fewer adverse effects, and it is effective even in MAC infections.Ethambutol is well absorbed after oral administration, is distributed widely in  the body, is metabolized in liver, crosses BBB in meningitis and is excreted in urine. Optic neuritis is the main adverse effect seen with ethambutol, which is characterized  by decreased visual acuity and colour vision defects (red–green). Hence, periodic eye examination is necessary when the patient is on ethambutol. The toxicity is reversible if the drug is discontinued early following onset of symptoms. It should be avoided in children younger than 6 years because they may not be able to report the disturbances in vision and it is also difﬁcult to test visual acuity in children. Hyperuricaemia is due to decreased clearance of urates. Other side effects are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, skin rashes, itching and joint pain.Streptomycin.  Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic. It is a bactericidal drug. It is active against extracellular bacilli in alkaline pH. Streptomycin is not effective orally; it must be injected intramuscularly. The adverse effects are ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity and neuromuscular blockade.Second-Line Antituberculosis AgentsThey are less effective, expensive and more toxic than the ﬁrst-line drugs, hence are  reserve drugs for TB.Para-Aminosalicylic Acid.  It is structurally similar to sulphonamides. Like sulphon-amides, PAS also competitively inhibits folate synthetase enzyme and prevents the  formation of tetrahydrofolic acid (THFA) which is necessary for growth and multiplica-tion of bacteria. Thus, PAS produces tuberculostatic effect. PAS is rapidly absorbed  after oral administration and distributed widely all over the body, but poorly penetrates the BBB. It is metabolized in liver by acetylation and excreted in urine. PAS inhibits  the acetylation of INH, thus increasing the plasma levels of INH. At present, PAS is  a reserve drug for the management of MDR-TB. The common adverse effects are GI 

416PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESdisturbances – anorexia, nausea, vomiting and abdominal discomfort – which can be minimized by giving the drug in divided doses on full stomach. The other side effects are hepatic damage, drug fever, skin rashes and thrombocytopenia.Ethionamide.  It is structurally similar to INH but is less efﬁcacious. It inhibits synthesis of mycolic acids. It is a bacteriostatic drug and is effective against both extracellular and intracellular bacilli. It is absorbed well after oral administration, and is distributed widely all over the body including CSF. It is metabolized in liver and excreted in urine. The common adverse effects are nausea, vomiting and epigastric pain. Other side effects are hepatitis, headache, blurred vision and paraesthesia.Cycloserine.  It is a second-line antitubercular drug with bacteriostatic activity. It inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis. It is distributed widely in the body including the CSF. The common side effects are related to CNS and include headache, tremor, psychosis and convulsions.T erizidone.  The mechanism of action is similar to that of cycloserine. It is effective in both pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB. It achieves good concentration in urine, hence useful in TB affecting urinary tract. It is better tolerated than cycloserine.Other Antitubercular AgentsI Fluoroquinolones: Ciproﬂoxacin, oﬂoxacin, moxiﬂoxacin and levoﬂoxacin – bactericidal agents, given orally.I Aminoglycosides: Amikacin and kanamycin – bactericidal agents, administered parenterally. Amikacin is less toxic than kanamycin.I Capreomycin (i.m.): May cause nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.I Macrolides: Azithromycin and clarithromycin – given orally.I Rifamycins: Rifapentine and rifabutin – bactericidal agents, given orally.Rifabutin: It is a derivative of rifampin. Rifabutin is preferred to rifampin for the treatment of TB in HIV-infected patients on PIs as rifabutin is a less  potent enzyme inducer. It is also used for the treatment of MAC infection in combination with clarithromycin and ethambutol.Rifapentine: Analogue of rifampin is a potent enzyme inducer.I Bedaquiline: It is a diarylquinoline. Bedaquiline inhibits production of energy in mycobacteria by inhibiting its ATP synthase. It is bactericidal and has a long half-life. It is administered orally. It is indicated for treatment of pulmonary MDR-TB in combination with other drugs. Bedaquiline should not be administered for more than 6 months. Patient should be monitored for response to treatment and adverse effects. It can cause hepatotoxicity and prolongation of QTc interval.TREATMENT OF TUBERCULOSIS  PH1.55The WHO recommends the use of MDT for all cases of TB. The objectives of MDT are as follows: 1. T o make the patient noninfectious as early as possible and decrease transmission of disease 2. T o prevent the development of drug-resistant bacilli 3. T o prevent relapse 4. T o reduce the total duration of effective therapyThe choice of standardized treatment regimens by each country – as recommended by the WHO – should be based on their efﬁcacy, effectiveness and availability of  ﬁnancial resources.

41711—CHEMOTHERAPYAll regimens for treatment of TB have two phases – an intensive phase followed by continuation phase. 1. Intensive phase: The patient receives intensive treatment with four to six drugs daily for a period of 2 months. The main objective of this phase is to rapidly kill the bacilli and render the patient noncontagious. 2. Continuation phase: The patient receives three to four drugs daily for a period of 4 months. This phase helps to eliminate the remaining bacilli and prevents relapse.Guidelines for the Treatment of TuberculosisThe regimen recommended for each patient depends on the diagnostic category for each patient. The Revised National T uberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) was launched in India in 1997. Under this programme, directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) treatment is being implemented. In DOTS, patient is administered drugs under the supervi-sion of a health worker or other trained person to ensure that drugs are actually consumed. The therapy must be supervised and monitored by bacteriological examination. DOTS is the backbone of RNTCP . It is aimed at ensuring patient compliance, thus preventing the emer-gence of drug-resistant TB. The latest revision of RNTCP guidelines was in 2016.Treatment of Drug-Sensitive Tuberculosis (Table 11.16)They could be new or previously treated case.New case: Those TB patients who have either never taken anti-TB drugs or taken them for less than a month.Previously treated case: Those TB patients who have taken anti-TB drugs for 1 month or more. They include treatment of recurrent TB, loss to follow-up and treatment failure cases.Type of patientIntensive phase (IP)Continuation phase (CP)New patients2 HRZE4 HRE6Previously treated patients2 HRZES /H11001 1 HRZE5 HRE8The preﬁx number before a regimen indicates the number of months of treatment.

Drug sensitivity testing should be done for all patients. Patients with or highly likely to have MDR-TB should be treated with regimens containing at least four drugs to which organisms  are known or presumed to be susceptible. Pyridoxine should also be administered to patients with MDR-TB to prevent neurotoxicity due to ethionamide, cycloserine, etc.Standard treatment regimen for MDR-TBIntensive phase (6–9 months)Continuation phase (18 months)Kanamycin, levoﬂoxacin, ethionamide,  cycloserine, pyrazinamide, ethambutol  /H11001 pyridoxine 100 mg/dayLevoﬂoxacin, ethionamide, ethambutol,  cycloserine /H11001 pyridoxine 100 mg/day(Source: T echnical and Operational Guidelines for TB Control in India 2016; https://tbcindia.gov.in/showﬁle.php?lid=3219).All drugs are administered daily under directly observed treatment.T o address the problem of MDR-TB, DOTS plus has been implemented. It is recom-mended in areas where DOTS is fully in place.Extensive Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB)  PH1.45Treatment is difﬁcult and mortality rate is high.Treatment of TB in HIV-Positive PatientsGenerally, TB treatment is the same for HIV-infected as for non-HIV-infected TB  patients. Short-course chemotherapy (daily regimen) must be started immediately once TB is diagnosed. Rifabutin is preferred to rifampin in HIV patients on antiretroviral drugs, such as PIs, as it does not interact with them.Tuberculosis in PregnancyAll ﬁrst-line drugs (INH, rifampin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) except streptomycin can be used in pregnancy.Management of antitubercular drug-induced adverse drug reactions  (WHO guidelines)I Anorexia, nausea: Administer the drugs with small meals.I Burning/numbness in the extremities: Administer pyridoxine.I Joint pain (associated with pyrazinamide): Treat with NSAID.I Flu-like syndrome (with intermittent dosing of rifampin): Switch to daily admin-istration of rifampin.

41911—CHEMOTHERAPYI Jaundice/hepatitis: Major adverse effect associated with H, R and Z. All drugs have to be stopped till the reaction subsides. Then the drugs are reintroduced, one at a time. Rifampin is introduced ﬁrst, followed by INH after 7 days. If both are  tolerated, then Z should not be administered.I Skin rash: Stop anti-TB drugs. The drugs are restarted one at a time at low doses which is then gradually increased. If reaction occurs following reintroduction of a particular drug, it should be stopped.I Visual disturbances: Ethambutol should be discontinued.Chemoprophylaxis of TuberculosisIt is the prophylactic use of antitubercular drugs to prevent the development of active TB in patients who are at risk. INH 300 mg (10 mg/kg in children) is administered daily for 6 months.Indications for Chemoprophylaxis 1. Newborn of a mother with active TB 2. Y oung children (younger than 6 years) with positive tuberculin test 3. Household contacts of patients with TB 4. Patients with positive tuberculin test with additional risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus, malignancy, silicosis and AIDSRole of Glucocorticoids in TuberculosisTB is a relative contraindication for the use of glucocorticoids. However, in certain  situations, glucocorticoids may be used under the cover of effective antitubercular therapy. They are as follows: 1. TB of serous membranes like pleura, pericardium and meninges to prevent ﬁbrous tissue formation and its sequelae 2. T o treat hypersensitivity reactions to antitubercular drugs 3. TB of the eye, larynx and genitourinary tract to prevent ﬁbrosis and scar tissue formationPrednisolone is the preferred agent except in meningitis (dexamethasone is preferred as it lacks mineralocorticoid activity). When the patient’s general condition improves, the steroid should be gradually tapered to avoid HPA-axis suppression. Glucocorticoids are contraindicated in intestinal TB owing to the risk of perforation.Drugs Used in the Treatment of Mycobacterium avium Complex infections Clarithromycin/azithromycin, ethambutol, rifabutin. Other useful drugs are ciproﬂoxa-cin, levoﬂoxacin and moxiﬂoxacin. A combination of drugs is used. The duration of therapy required is 18–24 months. For prophylaxis, azithromycin/clarithromycin/ rifabutin is used.Antileprotic Drugs  PH1.46Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by M. leprae, which is an acid-fast bacillus.TYPES OF LEPROSYLepromatous LeprosyThe cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is impaired against lepra bacilli; hence, the course of the disease progresses very rapidly. This is characterized by extensive bilateral skin lesions which contain numerous lepra bacilli. There is involvement of more than one nerve.

420PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESTuberculoid LeprosyThe CMI is intact and is characterized by predominant peripheral nerve involvement with a single or few skin lesions. The bacilli are rarely seen in the lesions.Plenty of lepra bacilli are seen in the skin lesions of borderline (BB), borderline  lepromatous (BL) and lepromatous leprosy (LL); hence, these groups are called  multibacillary leprosy (MBL).Borderline tuberculoid (BT), tuberculoid (TT) and indeterminate (I) leprosy are  referred to as PBL.Drugs Used for the Treatment of Leprosy.  Dapsone or diaminodiphenylsulphone (DDS), clofazimine, rifampin, ethionamide, oﬂoxacin, moxiﬂoxacin, minocycline and clarithro-mycin are the drugs used in leprosy.Dapsone or DiaminodiphenylsulphoneDapsone (Fig. 11.11), a sulphone, is the oldest, cheapest and most widely used agent for the treatment of leprosy even today.Mechanism of Action.  Sulphones are chemically related to sulphonamides and have the same mechanism of action. Lepra bacilli utilize PABA for the synthesis of folic acid, which, in turn, is necessary for its growth and multiplication. Dapsone is structurally similar to PABA, hence competitively inhibits folate synthetase enzyme and prevents the formation of THFA. Thus, dapsone produces leprostatic effect.Para-aminobenzoic acidDapsoneFolate synthetaseDihydrofolic acidDihydrofolate reductaseT etrahydrofolic acid/H11002
Pharmacokinetics.  Dapsone is given orally and is almost completely absorbed from the gut; it is bound to plasma proteins, widely distributed in the body and concentrated mainly in the infected skin, muscle, liver, kidney, etc. It is partly secreted in bile and  undergoes enterohepatic cycling. Dapsone is metabolized by acetylation and metabolites are excreted in urine.Adverse Effects.  The common adverse effects are dose-related haemolytic anaemia particu-larly in patients with G6PD deﬁciency. Other side effects are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fever, headache, allergic dermatitis, itching and peripheral neuropathy. Methaemoglobinaemia can also occur.Dapsone may cause exacerbation of lesions – ‘sulphone syndrome’ , which is characterized  by fever, dermatitis, pruritus, lymphadenopathy, methaemoglobinaemia, anaemia and hepatitis.RifampinIt is the most effective and rapidly acting bactericidal drug for lepra bacilli. It kills most of the lepra bacilli.NH2NH2SO2Fig. 11.11 Structure of dapsone.

42111—CHEMOTHERAPYClofazimineIt is a phenazine dye and has leprostatic activity against lepra bacilli. It has anti-inﬂammatory effect, hence is also useful in the treatment of type 2 lepra reaction. Clofazimine binds  to mycobacterial DNA to inhibit its template function. It also has activity against dapsone-resistant organism. It is given orally – fatty meal increases its absorption. It accumulates  in tissues – t½ is 70 days. It causes reddish-black discolouration of the skin on exposed parts. It can cause pigmentation of the conjunctiva and cornea, and discolouration of hair, tears, sweat, urine, etc. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain are its other side effects. It is contraindicated in pregnancy.EthionamideIt is a second-line antitubercular drug and is also effective against lepra bacilli. Ethion-amide can be used as an alternative drug when there is a contraindication for the use of clofazimine or if it is unacceptable. It may cause hepatotoxicity.The other agents that are found to be effective against lepra bacilli are minocycline, clarithromycin, peﬂoxacin and oﬂoxacin.Clarithromycin: It is a macrolide antibiotic and has bactericidal activity against M. leprae.Minocycline: It is the only tetracycline that has antileprotic activity.Oﬂoxacin: It has signiﬁcant bactericidal activity against lepra bacilli.Moxiﬂoxacin: It has potent antileprotic activity.CHEMOTHERAPY OF LEPROSYThe WHO recommends the use of MDT for all leprosy cases. The National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP) has implemented the guidelines for treatment. The objectives and need for MDT are as follows: 1 .  To  m a ke  t h e  p a t i e n t  n o n co n t a g i o u s  a s  e a r l y  a s  p o s s i b l e  by  k i l l i n g  t h e  d iv i d i n g  b a c i l l i 2.

422PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESLEPRA REACTIONSThese are immunologically mediated reactions that occur during the course of the  disease. The exact cause of such reactions is not clear and is usually precipitated by  infection, trauma, mental stress, etc. There are two types of reactions: 1 .  Reversal reaction: It is a delayed type of hypersensitivity reaction seen in leprosy, both multibacillary and paucibacillary cases, e.g. BL and BT. There are signs of inﬂamma-tion in the existing skin lesions – they become red, warm and swollen. New lesions  may appear. Nerves are frequently affected. They are tender and painful. General symptoms are not common. They are treated with clofazimine or prednisolone. 2. Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL): It occurs in cases of LL. It is a type III hypersensitivity reaction (Arthus-type) due to release of antigen from the dying lepra bacilli. There is erythema nodosum – red, painful, tender cutaneous and subcutaneous nodules. Nerves may be affected. Constitutional symptoms are present. Severe form of reaction is treated with thalidomide, but pregnancy is  the absolute contraindication for its use. The other drugs used are aspirin,  clofazimine, chloroquine and prednisolone.Antifungal AgentsMost of the fungal infections (Table 11.17) are opportunistic; hence they are common in diabetes mellitus, cancer, AIDS and pregnancy, and in patients on broad-spectrum AMAs and on immunosuppressant therapy such as prolonged course of corticosteroids and anticancer drugs.CLASSIFICATION 1.

Other topical antifungal agents: Whitﬁeld’s ointment, tolnaftate, sodium thiosulphate, selenium sulphide, undecylenic acid, ciclopirox, butenaﬁnePolyene AntibioticsAMB, nystatin and hamycin are polyene antibiotics; they have the same mechanism of action.Amphotericin B.  AMB is a broad-spectrum antifungal antibiotic. It is effective against Cryptococcus, Coccidioides, Candida, Aspergillus, Blastomyces, Histoplasma, Sporothrix, fungi causing mucormycosis, etc.Pharmacokinetics.  AMB is not absorbed from the gut, hence is not suitable orally for systemic infections. It is highly bound to plasma proteins and sterols in tissues, and widely distributed to various tissues but does not cross BBB. It is metabolized in liver and excreted slowly in urine and bile.Mechanism of Action.  Fungal cell membrane contains a sterol which resembles cholesterol and is called ‘ergosterol’ .Bind tightly to ergosterol infungal cell membraneForm ‘pores’ and‘channels’ inthe membranePermeability of themembrane increasesLeakage of intracellular contentsDeath of the fungi(fungicidal)• Amphotericin B • Nystatin• Hamycin
Adverse Effects.  AMB is the most toxic of all antifungal agents.The acute reactions are fever, chills, headache, dyspnoea, GI disturbances, phlebitis  at the site of injection, etc. The drug should be continued. Coadministration of steroid can minimize the reaction.Anaemia and electrolyte disturbances are commonly seen. Anaemia is less with  lipid-based formulations.Nephrotoxicity with azotaemia is seen in most of the patients on AMB therapy. Hepatotoxicity can occur occasionally. Headache and convulsions may occur on  intrathecal administration.Formulations of Amphotericin B.  AMB is poorly water soluble; hence, intravenous preparation is made with deoxycholate – conventional amphotericin B (C-AMB).AMB colloidal dispersion (ABCD), AMB–lipid complex (ABLC) and liposomal AMB (L-AMB) are the lipid-based new formulations of AMB. L-AMB provides targeted drug delivery and has less adverse effects like acute reaction, anaemia and nephrotoxicity than conventional preparation. It is expensive.Uses.  AMB is highly efﬁcacious but highly toxic too; hence, azoles (ﬂuconazole and itraconazole) have replaced AMB in the treatment of many fungal diseases. 1. It is effective in almost all systemic mycoses, e.g. mucormycosis, aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, sporotrichosis, histoplasmosis and blastomycosis. 2. It is useful topically for oral and cutaneous candidiasis. 3. Other uses: L-AMB is useful in leishmaniasis (as the drug reaches the reticuloen-dothelial cells) and febrile neutropenia.

424PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESNystatin.  Nystatin is poorly absorbed from skin and mucous membranes. It is highly toxic for systemic use. It is used only topically in Candida infections. It is available as suspension, ointment, cream, powder and tablet and also in combination with  corticosteroids or antibacterial agents.Uses.  Nystatin is used: 1. T opically for oral, oropharyngeal, corneal, conjunctival and cutaneous candidiasis 2. As oral tablets for intestinal candidiasis and superinfection due to Candida 3. In vaginal candidiasis, as vaginal suppositoriesAdverse Effects.  They include nausea and bitter taste.Hamycin.  It was developed in India (Hindustan Antibiotics)It is useful topically for oral, cutaneous and vaginal candidiasis. It is available as  ointment and suspension for topical administration.EchinocandinsCaspofungin Acetate.  Caspofungin acetate is a semisynthetic antifungal agent effective against Candida and Aspergillus. It is an antifungal antibiotic that acts by inhibiting the synthesis of glucans in fungal cell wall. It is not effective orally and is adminis-tered by i.v. infusion, metabolized in liver, and metabolites are excreted in faeces and urine. It is used in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis and candidiasis, when pa-tient is not responding to or intolerant to other antifungal agents. The adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, ﬂushing, fever and phlebitis at the site of injection. It is expensive.Micafungin.  The mechanism of action is similar to that of caspofungin. It is adminis-tered for treatment of invasive candidiasis. It is also useful for prophylaxis of invasive candidiasis and in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation.Heterocyclic Compound – Griseofulvin.  Griseofulvin, an antifungal antibiotic, is used orally for dermatophytic infections. It is not effective topically.Mechanism of ActionGriseofulvinInteracts withpolymerized microtubulesDisrupts themitotic spindlesSpindle poison – thus, griseofulvin inhibits fungal mitosis (fungistatic)Pharmacokinetics.  Griseofulvin is administered orally. Its bioavailability is in-creased by taking with fatty food and by using ultraﬁne preparation. It gets concen-trated in keratinized tissues, such as skin, hair and nails. It is an enzyme inducer, thus reduces the effectiveness of warfarin and oral contraceptives. It may produce disulﬁ-ram-like action, hence can cause intolerance to alcohol. It is metabolized in liver and excreted in urine.Uses.  Griseofulvin is used in the treatment of dermatophytic infections. The dura-tion of treatment depends on the site of lesion and thickness of infected keratin layer. Treatment must be continued until infected tissue is completely replaced by normal skin, hair and nail. For tinea (ringworm) infections (tinea capitis, tinea barbae, tinea corporis, tinea pedis), 4–6 weeks of therapy is required. Ultraﬁne griseofulvin 250 mg q.i.d. for 4–6 weeks is given. In onychomycosis of ﬁngernails, griseofulvin 250 mg q.i.d. for 6 months, and for toenails treatment up to 1 year, is required. Triazoles or terbinaﬁne is preferred for onychomycosis.

Adverse Effects.  They are headache, rashes, peripheral neuritis, confusion, fatigue, vertigo, blurred vision and GI effects, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and  heartburn. The other side effects include leucopenia and rarely hepatotoxicity.AntimetabolitesFlucytosine (Table 11.18).  Flucytosine is a prodrug. It is taken up by susceptible fungal cells and converted into 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU) that interferes with fungal DNA synthesis by inhibiting thymidylate synthase enzyme, thus producing fungistatic effect.Inhibit thymidylate synthaseInterfere withfungal DNA synthesis5-FluorouracilFlucytosineMetabolitesFlucytosine has narrow spectrum of activity and is effective against Cryptococcus, Chromoblastomyces and Candida spp.Uses.  Flucytosine is used in combination with AMB for cryptococcal meningitis. The advantages of this combination are as follows: 1. The entry of ﬂucytosine into the fungal cells is facilitated because of increased permeability of membrane due to the action of AMB. 2. Reduced toxicity of AMB because of reduction in drug dosage. 3. Produces rapid culture conversion (culture becomes negative). 4. Reduced duration of therapy and less chance for emergence of resistance.Adverse Effects.  These include bone marrow suppression with anaemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. The other side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea,  alopecia, skin rashes, itching and rarely hepatitis.AzolesAzole antifungals are broadly divided into imidazoles and triazoles.

Mechanism of Action.  Azoles impair ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting 14/H9251-demethylase enzyme (Fig. 11.12).Miconazole and Clotrimazole.  They are used topically for dermatophytic and Candida infections. They are available as cream, gel, lotion, solution, spray, vaginal pessary, etc. Clotrimazole troche is also available.Uses 1. Dermatophytic infections: Both are useful topically for tinea pedis, tinea cruris, tinea corporis and tinea versicolor. 2. Candida infections: They are used topically for the treatment of oral, pharyngeal, vulvovaginal and cutaneous candidiasis. 3. Miconazole is also useful in otomycosis.Adverse Effects.  These are local irritation, itching or burning. Miconazole is safe for use during pregnancy.Ketoconazole.  KTZ is a prototype drug among azoles. It is effective orally as well as topically for various fungal infections, such as candidiasis, dermatophytosis and deep mycosis (Table 11.19). It is the most toxic among azoles, hence used commonly by topical route for Candida and dermatophytic infections. For most of the systemic mycosis, it has been replaced by triazoles.Pharmacokinetics.  It is orally effective. Acidic environment favours the absorption of KTZ; hence, its bioavailability is reduced by drugs like H2-blockers, proton pump inhibitors or antacids. It is highly bound to plasma proteins, metabolized in liver  extensively and excreted mainly in faeces.Adverse Effects.  KTZ is the most toxic among azoles, but it is less toxic than AMB. Anorexia, nausea and vomiting are the most common side effects. KTZ reduces adrenal cortical steroids, testosterone and oestrogen synthesis – thus causes gynaecomastia,  oligospermia, loss of libido and impotence in males, and menstrual irregularities  and amenorrhoea in females. The other side effects are hepatotoxicity, hypersensitivity reactions like skin rashes and rarely itching.Drug Interactions.  KTZ is an enzyme inhibitor and increases the effect of the following drugs by inhibiting their metabolism:. 1. KTZ /H11003 Sulfonylureas  Hypoglycaemia 2. KTZ /H11003 Phenytoin  Phenytoin toxicity 3. KTZ /H11003 Cyclosporine  Potentiates nephrotoxicity 4. KTZ /H11003 Warfarin  Increased risk of bleeding 5. KTZ /H11003 T erfenadine  Fatal ventricular arrhythmiasUses 1.

428PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES 2. Candidiasis: KTZ is very toxic for systemic use; hence, it has been replaced by triazoles. 3. Other uses include kala-azar, dermal leishmaniasis and Cushing syndrome.Fluconazole.  It is a triazole. It is available for oral and i.v. administration as well as for topical use in the eye. It has a broad spectrum of antifungal activity (Table 11.19). It is less toxic than KTZ.Pharmacokinetics.  It is well absorbed from the GI tract and has high bioavailability. Food or gastric pH does not affect its bioavailability. It is poorly bound to plasma  proteins, widely distributed in the body, freely crosses the BBB and reaches high concen-tration in CSF. It is mainly excreted in urine in the unchanged form.Adverse Effects.  The common side effects are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal discomfort. The other side effects include headache, alopecia, skin rashes  and hepatic necrosis. It is contraindicated during pregnancy because of teratogenic  effect. Fluconazole is an enzyme inhibitor.Uses 1 .  Candidiasis: Fluconazole is effective against oesophageal, oropharyngeal, vulvovaginal, cutaneous and invasive candidiasis. 2. Cryptococcal meningitis: Intravenous ﬂuconazole is the preferred drug in the treat-ment of cryptococcal meningitis. 3. In coccidioidal meningitis, i.v. ﬂuconazole is the drug of choice.It is not effective in aspergillosis.Advantages Over Ketoconazole.  It does not inhibit steroid synthesis, does not have antian-drogenic effect, has less drug interactions and absorption is not affected by gastric pH.Itraconazole.  It is a synthetic triazole. It is administered orally as well as by i.v. route. Gastric acidity favours the absorption of itraconazole. It is highly bound to plasma  proteins, does not cross BBB and is metabolized in liver. It has a broad spectrum of  activity against many fungi including Aspergillus.Adverse Effects.  These are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, hepatotoxicity and hy-pokalaemia. Itraconazole inhibits CYP3A4 and can increase serum levels of drugs metabo-lized by this enzyme. Inhibition of steroid hormone synthesis is not seen with itraconazole.Uses 1. Intravenous itraconazole is the drug of choice for histoplasmosis, blastomycosis and sporotrichosis. 2. Itraconazole is effective for oesophageal, oropharyngeal and vaginal candidiasis, but is not superior to ﬂuconazole. 3. Dermatophytosis: It is useful in tinea capitis, tinea corporis, tinea barbae and tinea versicolor. 4. In onychomycosis, oral itraconazole is used. 5. Unlike ﬂuconazole, it is also effective in aspergillosis.Vo r i c o n a z o l e .  It is a triazole. It is used for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis and dis-seminated Candida i n f e c t i o n s .

A d-verse effects of voriconazole include visual and auditory disturbances, prolongation of QT interval and skin rashes. It inhibits cytochrome enzymes. It is contraindicated in pregnancy.Posaconazole.  Posaconazole, an azole, has a broad spectrum of activity against many fungi including Aspergillus and agents causing mucormycosis. It is administered orally; 

42911—CHEMOTHERAPYfatty food increases its bioavailability. Adverse effects include headache, sedation and GI disturbances.AllylamineT erbinaﬁne.  T erbinaﬁne, an allylamine, inhibits squalene 2,3-epoxidase and blocks ergosterol synthesis (Fig. 11.12). It is available for topical as well as for oral administra-tion (Fig. 11.13). It is well absorbed after oral administration and is concentrated in skin, nails and adipose tissue. It is highly bound to plasma proteins, poorly penetrates the BBB, is metabolized in liver and is excreted in urine. It is effective against dermato-phytes and Candida. T erbinaﬁne is a fungicidal agent.Adverse Effects.  T erbinaﬁne may cause side effects, such as nausea, diarrhoea, dys-pepsia and rarely hepatitis. It may cause itching, rashes, local irritation on topical use.Uses 1. Dermatophytosis: T erbinaﬁne is very effective against dermatophytes. It is used topically or orally for tinea pedis, tinea corporis and tinea cruris.In onychomycosis of hands and feet, it is used orally and is more effective than itraconazole. 2. Candidiasis: T erbinaﬁne is less effective in Candida infections.Other Topical Agents 1. Whitﬁeld’s ointment: It contains 6% benzoic acid and 3% salicylic acid. Salicylic acid has keratolytic and benzoic acid has fungistatic effects. It is used in the  treatment of tinea pedis. 2. Undecylenic acid: It is mainly a fungistatic drug. It is available as ointment, cream, powder, soap and liquid. It is used in the treatment of tinea pedis, tinea cruris and other dermatophytoses. 3. Selenium sulphide: It is useful for tinea versicolor. 4. T olnaftate: It is useful in tinea cruris and tinea corporis. 5. Ciclopirox: It is useful against tinea versicolor. 6.

43311—CHEMOTHERAPYprevention of inﬂuenza A (avian inﬂuenza or bird ﬂu and swine ﬂu) and inﬂuenza B virus infections. Adverse effects are nausea, vomiting and abdominal discomfort.  Dose: for prophylaxis, 75 mg o.d. for 7 days; for treatment, 75 mg b.d. for 5 days.Zanamivir.  The mechanism of action and uses are similar to those of oseltamivir. Oral bioavailability is low. It is administered by inhalation. Adverse effects are bronchospasm, headache and dizziness. It should be avoided in patients with airway disease.Peramivir.  It is active against inﬂuenza A and B, bird ﬂu and swine ﬂu virus. It is admin-istered as a single i.v. dose in severe inﬂuenza. It is well tolerated.Anti-Hepatitis Drugs  PH1.48ANTI–HEPATITIS B DRUGSThe aim of treatment is viral suppression and prevention of complications like cirrhosis. Lamivudine, tenofovir, entecavir and adefovir dipivoxil inhibit hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase. T enofovir is well tolerated and highly effective for chronic hepatitis B virus infections.ANTI–HEPATITIS C DRUGSTreatment is directed to suppress the virus. Drugs are expensive. They include ribavirin (inhibits RNA synthesis), sofosbuvir (inhibits viral RNA polymerase), interferon (inhibits viral protein synthesis), daclatasvir and ledipasvir (inhibit HCV replication).Interferons.  Interferons are proteins produced by virus-infected cells and also by recom-binant DNA technology. There are mainly three types of interferons, namely /H9251, /H9252 and /H9253. Antiviral activity of interferons is due to the inhibition of viral penetration, synthesis of mRNA, translation of viral proteins, assembly of viral particles and their release. They are administered by i.m. and s.c. routes or locally into the lesion.Uses.  Interferon-/H9251 is used for the treatment of venereal warts, herpetic infections in immunosuppressed individuals, chronic hepatitis B and C and Kaposi sarcoma in HIV patients.Adverse Effects.  These include fever, headache, myalgia, skin rashes, alopecia, bone marrow suppression, cardiotoxicity, neurotoxicity and thyroid dysfunction.Ribavirin.  It is a synthetic purine nucleoside analogue and has a wide range of anti-viral activity. Ribavirin monophosphate competitively inhibits cellular enzymes that are needed for the synthesis of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and nucleic acid. Ribavirin triphosphate also competitively inhibits the viral mRNA synthesis. It is administered by oral, aerosol or i.v. routes. It is metabolized in liver and excreted in urine.Ribavirin is effective against a wide range of RNA and DNA viruses. It is used to treat inﬂuenza, parainﬂuenza, measles, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus infections. Oral ribavirin is effective in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection.Adverse Effects.  These include nausea, tiredness, cough, dyspnoea, anaemia and in-somnia. Conjunctival and respiratory irritation may occur on aerosol therapy. Ribavirin is contraindicated in pregnancy and child-bearing age group because of its teratogenic, mutagenic, embryotoxic and gonadotoxic effects.

434PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESAntiretroviral Drugs  PH1.48Classiﬁcation of antiretroviral drugs is shown on p. 430. NRTIs, PIs and integrase inhibitors are effective against both HIV-1 and HIV-2. NNRTIs and entry inhibitors  are active against HIV-1.Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase InhibitorsThese drugs, after entering HIV-infected cells, are converted to their active triphosphate forms by cellular kinases and competitively inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase. They get incorporated into the growing viral DNA and cause termination of chain elongation of proviral DNA (Fig. 11.14).Zidovudine (Azidothymidine [AZT]).  Zidovudine, a thymidine analogue, was the ﬁrst an-tiretroviral drug approved for the treatment of HIV infection. It is the prototype drug of NRTIs. Zidovudine is effective against HIV-1 and HIV-2. It protects the uninfected cells from HIV , but has no effect on HIV-infected cells. Zidovudine is orally effective. It is well absorbed from the GI tract, metabolized in liver by glucuronide conjugation and excreted in urine. It crosses placental and BBB and is also secreted in milk.

43511—CHEMOTHERAPYAdverse Effects and Drug Interactions.  Bone marrow suppression, anaemia and neutropenia are the common side effects. Nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, headache and insomnia are commonly seen during the initial stages of therapy. Long-term therapy may cause hepatotoxicity, myopathy with fatigue and lactic acidosis. 1. Zidovudine /H11003 paracetamol: Both are metabolized by glucuronide conjugation. Paracetamol competes and interferes with glucuronide conjugation of zidovudine. This leads to a rise in the plasma concentration of zidovudine and its toxicity. 2. Azoles /H11003 zidovudine: Azole antifungal agents are hepatic microsomal enzyme inhibitors. They inhibit the metabolism of zidovudine. This leads to an increase in plasma concentration of zidovudine resulting in its toxicity. 3. Zidovudine and stavudine: They should not be combined together because they compete for intracellular phosphorylation.Zidovudine is used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-infected patients. It is also used for postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) and to  prevent vertical transmission of HIV .• Didanosine• Stavudine• Zalcitabine• Lamivudine• EmtricitabineTransported into cells and activated  to respective triphosphate formsInhibit HIVreverse transcriptaseDNA chainterminationDidanosine, Stavudine, Zalcitabine, Lamivudine, Emtricitabine and Abacavir.  They are effective orally. Lamivudine is a commonly used agent in antiretroviral therapy (ART) because of its low toxicity and efﬁcacy. Emtricitabine is one of the least toxic antiretro-viral agents. Stavudine and didanosine should not be combined because of increased risk of peripheral neuritis, pancreatitis and lactic acidosis. Abacavir can cause hypersen-sitivity reactions.Te n o f ov i r (Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor).  It is a nucleotide analogue of adenosine. It undergoes intracellular phosphorylation and inhibits viral reverse tran-scriptase enzyme resulting in termination of chain elongation of HIV DNA. Flatulence can occur with tenofovir. It should be cautiously used in patients with renal disease.  It is used in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of AIDS. T enofovir and lamivudine are also effective against hepatitis B virus.Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase InhibitorsNNRTIs are highly active against HIV-1 but have no effect on HIV-2. They directly and noncompetitively inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme. There is no cross-resistance with the NRTIs. They are used in combination with NRTIs in the treatment of AIDS. Adverse effects are skin rashes, fever, nausea, pruritus and CNS disturbances like head-ache, confusion, insomnia, bad dreams and amnesia.Bind directly to reverse transcriptase enzyme and inhibit (noncompetitively) their function(Do not require intracellular phosphorylation)• Nevirapine• Delavirdine• EfavirenzNevirapine.  It is a highly lipid-soluble drug and is almost completely absorbed from the GI tract. It freely crosses the placental barrier and BBB. It is secreted in breast milk. Rashes are the frequent side effect of nevirapine. It can cause hepatotoxicity (risk is  increased if the patient is also on antiTB drug, rifampin). It is extensively metabolized in liver and excreted mainly in urine.

436PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESEfavirenz.  Efavirenz has a long duration of action and is administered once daily. It is taken on empty stomach. It mainly causes CNS side effects like headache and dizziness. Rashes also occur with efavirenz.Protease InhibitorsExamples are indinavir, nelﬁnavir, atazanavir, saquinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, fosampre-navir and darunavir.They competitively inhibit the HIV protease enzyme and prevent cleavage of viral polyproteins to the ﬁnal functional, structural and enzymatic components of HIV n immature and noninfectious viral particles are produced and infection of other cells is prevented.Cross-resistance is common among the PIs, but there is no cross-resistance with  reverse transcriptase inhibitors. PIs are used orally with reverse transcriptase inhibitors in patients with AIDS. They are extensively metabolized in liver. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea are common side effects. They also produce skeletal muscle wasting, lipodys-trophy, insulin resistance, diabetes, etc.Indinavir.  Nephrolithiasis and hyperbilirubinaemia are also seen. Good hydration can reduce the incidence of nephrolithiasis.Nelﬁnavir.  Diarrhoea is an important side effect.Ritonavir.  Ritonavir inhibits CYP3A4 and causes a number of drug interactions. It inhibits both HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases. Low-dose ritonavir is used in combination with other PIs (saquinavir, lopinavir, indinavir and atazanavir) – boosted PI regimen. Ritonavir inhibits metabolism of coadministered PIs (by inhibiting CYP3A4), increases their bio-availability and half-life n dose and frequency of administration of coadministered PIs is reduced (number of tablets of PI to be taken is reduced). Nelﬁnavir is not combined with ritonavir as it is metabolized by a different enzyme.Entry or Fusion InhibitorsEnfuvirtide and Maraviroc.  Enfuvirtide prevents fusion of HIV-1 membrane with host cell membrane n blocks viral entry into the cell. It is administered subcutaneously. Injection-site reactions like pain and erythema are the important adverse effects. It is given as an add-on drug in patients who are not responding to ongoing ART. It does not exhibit cross-resistance with reverse transcriptase inhibitors and PIs.Maraviroc is a CCR5 chemokine receptor antagonist n blocks binding of CCR5 – tropic strains of HIV to host cell. It is given orally. It is generally well tolerated. Adverse effects like cough, myalgia, arthralgia, diarrhoea and hepatotoxicity may occur.Integrase InhibitorsRaltegravir and Dolutegravir.  They inhibit integrase enzyme n prevent integration of viral DNA with host DNA. They are effective against both HIV-1 and HIV-2. Dolutegravir  is better tolerated and is administered once daily. Myopathy can occur with raltegravir; dolutegravir can cause hepatotoxicity. There is a risk of neural tube defect with dolutegravir during its use in the ﬁrst trimester. Hence, it should be avoided during periconception  period. Rifampin induces metabolism of dolutegravir; hence, dose of dolutegravir must be doubled when coadministered with rifampin.Treatment of HIV Infection  PH1.55Retroviruses contain RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase) enzyme. They cause selective depletion of CD4 cells leading to a profound decrease in cell-mediated immunity. Hence, the infected person is prone to severe opportunistic infections, Kaposi sarcoma and lymphoid malignancies.

43711—CHEMOTHERAPYObjectives of Antiretroviral Therapy 1. T o suppress HIV replication and improve immune status of the patient 2. T o prevent the emergence of drug-resistant virus 3. T o prevent opportunistic infectionsPrinciples of Therapy.  ART regimen is used to achieve the above objectives. In ART regimen, drugs with different mechanism of action should be used so that they produce synergistic effect. Use of drug combinations also prevents development of resistance. It usually consists of a combination of two NRTIs with a NNRTI/integrase inhibitor/PI.Criteria for Anti-HIV Treatment.  The National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) has adopted WHO 2016 guidelines for treatment of HIV infection. As per guidelines, ART should be started in all HIV-infected patients irrespective of CD4 count or clinical stage. Treatment is lifelong. A combination of antiretroviral drugs is used.First-Line ART Regimen in AdultsTwo NRTIs /H11001 one NNRTI/integrase inhibitor (INSTI)The preferred regimen is the following:I T enofovir (TDF) /H11001 lamivudine (3TC) /H11001 efavirenz (EFV)I T enofovir (TDF) /H11001 emtricitabine (FTC) /H11001 efavirenz (EFV)I T enofovir (TDF) /H11001 lamivudine (3TC)/emtricitabine (FTC) /H11001 dolutegravir (DTG) is another ﬁrst-line regimen which can be used.Alternate regimensI Zidovudine (AZT) /H11001 lamivudine (3TC) /H11001 efavirenz (EFV)I Zidovudine (AZT) /H11001 lamivudine (3TC) /H11001 nevirapine (NVP)I T enofovir (TDF) /H11001 lamivudine (3TC)/emtricitabine (FTC) /H11001 nevirapine (NVP)Fixed-dose combination once daily is preferred for initiation of treatment.Monitoring of Therapy.  Estimation of HIV viral load is preferred.Second-Line ART Regimen in Adults.  It should consist of 2NRTIs /H11001 boosted PI.The NRTIs to be used are the following:I Zidovudine (AZT) /H11001 lamivudine (3TC), if the ﬁrst-line regimen was tenofovir basedI T enofovir (TDF) /H11001 lamivudine (3TC), if the ﬁrst-line regimen was zidovudine basedI Boosted PI:Atazanavir/ritonavir (ATV/r) or lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) is preferred.Alternative boosted PI is darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r).Pregnant Women.  ART should be started in all pregnant women with HIV irrespec-tive of CD4 count and WHO clinical stage. A combination of tenofovir (300 mg) /H11001 lamivudine (300 mg) /H11001 efavirenz (600 mg) is recommended in HIV-positive pregnant women. Treatment is lifelong.Prophylaxis in Infants.  Infants of women on ART should receive nevirapine daily for 6 weeks.Prophylaxis of HIV InfectionPre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is administration of antiretroviral drugs prior to exposure to HIV for preventing HIV infection. Those at high risk of HIV infection include heterosexual men, women, transgenders and i.v. drug abusers. A ﬁxed-dose combination of tenofovir (300 mg) /H11001 emtricitabine (200 mg) daily is used.Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP). Use of antiretroviral drugs after exposure has occurred to prevent HIV infection is post-exposure prophylaxis. Individuals who have had exposure (e.g. sexual exposure, needle-prick injury, exposure to blood, breast milk, CSF, pleural, pericardial ﬂuid) need PEP depending on the risk of HIV transmission and HIV status of the source. PEP should be initiated as early as possible, preferably within 72 hours of exposure.

Treatment with anti-TB drugs is started ﬁrst. This is followed by administration of ART within 8 weeks of start of treatment with anti-TB drugs.Antimalarial Drugs  PH1.47Malaria is a protozoal infection caused by genus Plasmodium and transmitted to humans by the infected female Anopheles mosquito .  The species of malarial parasites are Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae, P. falc ipar um and Plasmodium knowlesi. The incidence of malaria is increasing due to the resistance of vectors to insecticides and drug-resistant parasites. In India, P. v ivax and P. falc ipar um are common.CLASSIFICATION 1. Chemical classiﬁcation (a) 4-Aminoquinolines: Chloroquine, amodiaquine, piperaquine (b) 8-Aminoquinolines: Primaquine, tafenoquine (c) Quinoline methanol: Meﬂoquine (d) Alkaloids: Quinine, quinidine (e) Antifolates: Pyrimethamine, sulphadoxine, dapsone, proguanil (f) Antibiotics: Doxycycline, clindamycin (g) Hydroxynaphthoquinone: Atovaquone (h) Artemisinins: Artemisinin, artemether, artesunate, arteether, arterolane, dihydroartemisinin (i) Aryl alcohol: Lumefantrine 2. Clinical classiﬁcation (a) This classiﬁcation is based on the stage of the parasite they affect (Table 11.21 and Fig. 11.15). (i) Tissue schizontocidal agents: These act on primary (pre-erythrocytic) and latent (hypnozoites) tissue forms in the liver, e.g. primaquine, and are effec-tive against both forms; atovaquone and proguanil act on primary form. (ii) Blood schizontocidal agents: These act on erythrocytic stage of Plasmo-dium and, thereby, terminate the clinical attack.I Rapid acting and high-efﬁcacy agents, e.g. chloroquine, artemisinin deriva-tives, quinine, meﬂoquine, atovaquone, amodiaquine and lumefantrine.I Slow-acting and low-efﬁcacy agents, e.g. proguanil, pyrimethamine /H11001 sulphadoxine and clindamycin; used always in combination with rapid-acting agents.

Note: Points to remember 1. None of the agents available are effective against sporozoites. 2. Most of the antimalarials are effective against asexual blood stages except primaquine. 3. Only primaquine and tafenoquine are effective against hypnozoites (latent tissue forms). 4. All agents with ‘quine’ (primaquine, chloroquine and quinine) are effective against gametocytes except meﬂoquine and tafenoquine. 5. Primaquine, proguanil and pyrimethamine are effective against hepatic primary tissue forms.Table 11.21  Antimalarial drugs effective against various stages of life cycle of malarial parasite
 (iii) Gametocidal agents: These kill gametocytes of plasmodia in blood, e.g. artemisinin and primaquine (active against all species); chloroquine and quinine (vivax). They reduce transmission to mosquitoes. (b) Based on clinical indication for use (clinical utility) (i) Drugs used for causal prophylaxis, i.e. pre-erythrocytic stage of Plasmodium in liver, e.g. proguanil and primaquine. Primaquine is effective against all species but not used due to its toxic potential. Proguanil is effective mainly for P . falciparum. (ii) Drugs for suppressive prophylaxis: Suppress erythrocytic phase, thus clinical attack of malaria is prevented – clinical disease is not manifested, e.g. chloroquine, meﬂoquine and doxycycline. (iii) Drugs used for clinical cure: These agents act on erythrocytic stages of malarial parasite to terminate the clinical attack. They are rapid-acting and slow-acting blood schizontocidal agents. (iv) Drugs used to prevent relapse: These drugs act on the latent tissue forms (hypnozoites) of P. vivax and P. ovale which cause relapse, e.g. prima-quine and tafenoquine.Radical cure of P. vivax and P. ovale is achieved with the use of a blood schizontocidal agent along with primaquine which acts on latent  tissue forms (hypnozoites) to prevent relapse.

(v) Drugs used to prevent the transmission of infection to Anopheles mosquito (gametocidal agents): Primaquine has gametocidal effect against all species of plasmodia that infect humans.4-AminoquinolinesChloroquine.  Chloroquine is a 4-aminoquinoline. It is very effective and rapidly acting blood schizontocide against P. v ivax, P. ovale, P. malar iae, chloroquine-sensitive strains of P . falciparum and P. knowlesi. It has no activity against liver forms (pre-erythrocytic and hypnozoites).Mechanism of Action.  Chloroquine is a basic drug, which is taken up by the acidic food vacuoles of susceptible plasmodia and inhibits the conversion of haeme to haemozoin. The ‘drug–haeme’ complex is toxic and kills the parasite. Resistance to chloroquine is  common with P . falciparum.In the acidic vacuole of plasmodia:Haemoglobin  Haeme (toxic)  Haemozoin (nontoxic)Chloroquine (weak base)  Concentrated in acidic     vacuole of parasite  binds to haeme Damages plasmodial membrane  Drug–haeme complex(prevents formation of haemozoin)IIPharmacokinetics.  Chloroquine is commonly administered by oral route. It is well ab-sorbed after oral and parenteral administration. It has strong afﬁnity for melanin-containing tissues. It gets rapidly distributed to tissues (extensive tissue binding); therefore, to achieve 

44111—CHEMOTHERAPYan effective therapeutic plasma concentration, a loading dose is used during treatment  of malaria. It gets concentrated in liver, spleen, kidney, lungs, skin, etc. Chloroquine is  metabolized in the liver and slowly excreted in urine.Adverse Effects and Contraindications.  Chloroquine in antimalarial doses may cause nau-sea, vomiting, skin rashes, itching, headache and visual disturbances. Parenteral administration can cause hypotension, confusion, cardiac arrhythmias, convulsions and even cardiac arrest. Prolonged administration in large doses, as in rheumatoid arthritis, may cause irreversible retinopathy and ototoxicity. It can also cause myopathy, cardiomyopathy, neuropathy and rarely psychiatric disturbances. Long-term therapy requires ophthalmological examination once in 3–6 months. It should be avoided in patients with epilepsy. It should not be given with meﬂoquine (can precipitate seizures). It is safe for use in pregnancy.Uses 1. Malaria (a) Chloroquine is the drug of choice for the treatment of acute attack of malaria caused by P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, chloroquine-sensitive P. falciparum and P. knowlesi (Table 11.22). Fever resolves within 24–48 hours; blood smear becomes negative within 2–3 days. (b) For malaria due to P. vivax and P. ovale, primaquine is also administered in addition to chloroquine (for radical cure). (c) Chloroquine is a very effective chemoprophylactic a g e n t  f o r  a l l  t y p e s  o f  malaria (Table 11.23) except that caused by the resistant strains of P . falciparum. 1.

Other uses are the following:Malaria.Amoebiasis – hepatic, as it is highly concentrated in the liver.Lepra reaction – anti-inﬂammatory effect is useful.Rheumatoid arthritis – it scavenges-free radicals and stabilizes lysosomal membrane.Infectious mononucleosis.Autoimmune disorder – discoid lupus erythematosus.Note: Uses of chloroquine: Mnemonic – MALARIA.Tablet chloroquine phosphate 500 mg /H11005 300 mg chloroquine baseTablet chloroquine phosphate 250 mg /H11005 150 mg chloroquine baseAmodiaquine.  It is a congener of chloroquine. The mechanism of action is similar to that of chloroquine. It is an erythrocytic schizontocide used in combination with artesunate for the treatment of chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria. It is not used for prophylaxis of malaria owing to its toxicities – agranulocytosis and hepatotoxicity.Piperaquine.  It is structurally related to chloroquine. It acts on blood stages of parasite. It has a long duration of action. Piperaquine is approved for use in combination with dihydroartemisinin for treatment of chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria. It is also used in combination with arterolane.

444PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESAlkaloidsQuinine and Quinidine.  Cinchona bark contains several alkaloids, of which quinine and quinidine are important.Mechanism of Action.  It is similar to that of chloroquine.Pharmacological Effects 1. Antimalarial actions: Quinine is a highly effective blood schizontocide against all the four species of plasmodia. It has gametocidal activity against P. vivax. It has no activity on hepatic forms (i.e. pre-erythrocytic and latent tissue forms). 2. Other actions (a) GIT: Being bitter, quinine reﬂexly increases gastric acid secretion. (b) CVS: Quinine directly depresses the myocardium and can cause hypotension. But this effect may not be seen with oral antimalarial doses. (c) Skeletal muscle: Quinine directly depresses the skeletal muscle contraction. Response to ACh is also diminished – symptoms of myasthenia gravis are exaggerated, while symptoms of myotonia congenita are relieved. (d) CNS: In therapeutic doses, quinine often causes disturbances of hearing and vision. It also has mild analgesic and antipyretic effects. 3. Local action: Quinine has local anaesthetic effect, but there is invariably an initial irritation. Orally, it causes GI irritation with nausea, vomiting and abdominal discomfort. Intramuscularly, it causes local pain and necrosis. Intravenously, it  can cause thrombophlebitis.Pharmacokinetics.  Quinine is readily absorbed from the gut or i.m. site, well distrib-uted in the body, extensively metabolized in liver and excreted mainly in urine.Adverse Effects.  Quinine causes dose-dependent toxicities. They are cinchonism, hypo-glycaemia and hypotension. Cinchonism comprises tinnitus, deafness, visual disturbances like blurred vision and colour defects, headache, nausea and vomiting. These symptoms are reversible on stoppage of therapy. Hypoglycaemia is common with i.v. quinine which is due to release of insulin – it is treated with intravenous glucose. Hypotension is also seen with intravenous administration of cinchona alkaloids. Quinine in large doses can cause hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias and A–V block. Quinidine is more cardiotoxic than quinine.‘Blackwater fever’ , a hypersensitivity reaction to quinine, is characterized by  haemolysis, haemoglobinaemia and haemoglobinuria leading to renal failure.Quinine/quinidine should not be used concurrently with meﬂoquine because of risk of serious cardiac toxicity. Quinine can be used in pregnancy.Uses 1 .  Malaria: Quinine is effective for treatment of acute attack of chloroquine-resistant P. falc ipar um malaria. Combination of clindamycin or tetracycline with quinine enhances the antimalarial efﬁcacy of quinine. In severe malaria, quinine or quinidine is administered intravenously. 2. Nocturnal leg cramps: Quinine may be effective in some cases.Quinine is not used for chemoprophylaxis of malaria because of its toxicity.Quinoline MethanolMeﬂoquine.  It is a synthetic quinoline methanol. Like quinine, it is a highly effective blood schizontocide and has no effect on hepatic forms, i.e. pre-erythrocytic stages and hypnozoites of P. vivax. It has no gametocidal activity.

44511—CHEMOTHERAPYMechanism of Action.  It is similar to that of chloroquine and quinine. It binds to heme and causes damage to membrane of Plasmodium.Pharmacokinetics.  Mefloquine is administered orally and is not suitable for parenteral use because of its local irritant action. It is well absorbed, widely distrib-uted, highly bound to plasma proteins, secreted in bile and undergoes extensive enterohepatic cycling. It is slowly excreted in the faeces with a terminal half-life of about 3 weeks.Uses.  Meﬂoquine is used for prophylaxis of chloroquine-resistant P. falc ipar um and P. v ivax malaria. It is used in combination with artesunate for the treatment of chloroquine-resistant P. falc ipar um malaria.Adverse Effects.  The common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and dizziness. Nausea and vomiting can be minimized by dividing the dose.  Neuropsychiatric symptoms and seizures can occur. Meﬂoquine is contraindicated in patients with conduction defects, epilepsy and psychiatric disorders. It is safe for use in young children.AntifolatesThey are pyrimethamine, sulphadoxine, sulphones (dapsone) and proguanil. They are not used as single agents in malaria owing to rapid development of resistance.Mechanism of Action.  Plasmodia utilize PABA for the synthesis of folic acid which, in turn, is necessary for DNA synthesis. Sulphadoxine and dapsone inhibit folate  synthetase, whereas pyrimethamine and proguanil inhibit DHF reductase enzyme of  the parasite. Sulfadoxine has a long half-life like pyrimethamine. Combination of  these drugs (pyrimethamine /H11001 sulphadoxine/dapsone) inhibits two successive steps (sequential blockade) in the folate pathway, acts faster and produces enhanced antima-larial action (supra-additive effect).Folate synthetaseFolate reductase• Sulphadoxine• DapsonePara-aminobenzoic acidDihydrofolic acid• Pyrimethamine• ProguanilTetrahydrofolic acid/H17054/H17054Pyrimethamine.  Pyrimethamine is a slow-acting blood schizontocide and has a greater afﬁnity for plasmodial DHF reductase. The combination of pyrimethamine with sulphadoxine along with artesunate is used in the treatment of chloroquine-resistant  P. falciparum malaria. Pyrimethamine–sulphadiazine combination is the treatment of choice for toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised patients.PreparationsPyrimethamine25mgsulphadoxine500mgPy/H11001 rrimethamine25mgdapsone100mg/H11001

446PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESPyrimethamine is completely absorbed after oral administration, binds to plasma proteins, and accumulates in liver, kidney, lungs and spleen. It has a long plasma half-life (80–90 hours) and is excreted slowly in urine. Adverse effects are skin rashes, urticaria, megaloblastic anaemia and teratogenic effect.Proguanil (Chloroguanide).  Proguanil is a prodrug. It has a wide margin of safety. It is a slow-acting blood schizontocide for all the four species of plasmodia. It also has activity against primary hepatic stages of P. falciparum. It is absorbed slowly after oral adminis-tration, metabolized in liver and excreted in urine. It rarely causes side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, haematuria and skin rashes.HydroxynaphthoquinoneAtovaquone.  Atovaquone is a rapidly acting blood schizontocide and is also effective against liver stages (pre-erythrocytic forms) of P. falciparum. It is administered orally. It is highly bound to plasma proteins and excreted unchanged in faeces via bile.Atovaquone is used with proguanil (Malarone) for prophylaxis of chloroquine- resistant P. falciparum malaria. It is also effective in the treatment of opportunistic infections with P. jiroveci and T. gondii in immunocompromised patients. The common adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, skin rashes and headache. It should be avoided in pregnant women.8-AminoquinolinePrimaquine.  It is a synthetic 8-aminoquinoline. It is effective against hepatic stages, i.e. primary and latent tissue forms of Plasmodia species that infect humans. It also has marked gametocidal activity but is ineffective against erythrocytic forms of malarial parasite. The exact mechanism of action of primaquine is unknown. It probably acts by generating reactive oxygen radicals and interfering with the mitochondrial electron transport in the parasite.It is almost completely absorbed after oral administration, widely distributed,  metabolized in liver and excreted slowly in urine.Primaquine is used for radical cure and terminal prophylaxis of P. vivax and P. ovale as it has strong activity against hypnozoites. For terminal prophylaxis, primaquine  15 mg daily is started shortly before or after return from an endemic area. For radical cure of relapsing malaria (P. vivax and P. ovale), a 2-week course of primaquine is given concurrently with chloroquine or after the treatment of acute attack.Adverse Effects.  These include nausea, vomiting and epigastric distress – can be minimized by taking it with food. The important side effect with primaquine is haemo-lytic anaemia in people with G6PD deﬁciency. Methaemoglobinaemia can also occur with primaquine. Primaquine is contraindicated in pregnancy.(Tablet primaquine phosphate 26 mg contains 15 mg base of primaquine base.)Ta fe n o q u i n e .  It is an 8-aminoquinoline. It is very effective against latent tissue forms (hypnozoites) of P. vivax, and also has blood schizontocidal activity. It has a longer dura-tion of action (t½ is 15–19 days), hence used as a single-dose antirelapse agent. It can cause hemolysis in G6PD deﬁcient individuals.Artemisinin and its Derivatives (Qinghaosu Compounds).  Artemisinin is derived from the plant Artemisia annua. The semisynthetic derivatives of artemisinin are dihydroartemis-inin, artemether and artesunate. Another compound, arteether, was developed in India.They are highly effective against erythrocytic stages of all plasmodia. They also have gametocidal action – reduce transmission of malarial parasite. They have no effect on hepatic stages of the parasite.

The half-life of  dihydroartemisinin is about 2 hours. Arteether has a longer half-life.Adverse Effects.  They are generally well tolerated. Artemisinins can cause mild GI disturbances, neutropenia and prolongation of QT interval.Arterolane.  It is a synthetic derivative of artemisinin which acts on erythrocytic stages of the parasite. It is potent and has a rapid onset and short duration of action. A combina-tion of arterolane with piperaquine has been found to be effective and well tolerated for the treatment of P. falciparum malaria.Uses of Artemisinins.  Artemisinins are used in the treatment of uncomplicated chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria and severe malaria.Artemisinins have a short half-life and are not used for chemoprophylaxis. They should not be used as monotherapy because of risk of development of resistance. They are used in combination with other antimalarials – artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). They are more potent, faster acting, better tolerated and affect various erythrocytic forms of the parasite as compared to chloroquine. The use of ACT im-proves treatment efﬁcacy, provides faster clinical cure and rapid parasite clearance, and prevents recrudescence and development of resistance. Artemisinin derivatives (short t½) can be combined with slowly eliminated antimalarials (long t½), e.g. meﬂoquine, lumefantrine and amodiaquine, for the treatment of chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria – duration of therapy is 3 days. Artemisinins rapidly kill 90%–95% of parasites; the remaining parasites are killed by the other drug.Artemisinin derivatives can also be combined with doxycycline, tetracycline and clindamycin – duration of therapy is 7 days.Recommended ACT regimens for treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria are shown in Table 11.22.Severe malaria: It is a medical emergency .  P atient with severe P. falc ipar um malaria may present with one or more of the following features: impaired consciousness, convul-sions, prostration, respiratory distress, circulatory collapse, shock, jaundice, pulmonary oedema, spontaneous bleeding, haemoglobinuria, hypoglycaemia, metabolic acidosis, renal failure and hyperparasitaemia. (For treatment, see Table 11.22, p. 442).

448PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESThe main aim of treatment is to prevent mortality. Treatment should be started  as early as possible. Artesunate is preferred to quinine for treatment of severe malaria because:I Risk of death is lower.I It causes rapid parasite clearance.I It is safe and well tolerated.I It does not require cardiac monitoring.I It does not require rate-controlled infusion.I Risk of hypoglycaemia is lower.I No cross-resistance with other antimalarial agents.LumefantrineIt is active against erythrocytic stages of all species of malarial parasite. Fatty meal increases its absorption. It can cause GI disturbances. It does not signiﬁcantly prolong QT interval. It is used in the treatment of P . falciparum malaria in combination with artemether.AntibioticsTe t r a c yc l i n e s and Clindamycin.  Tetracycline, doxycycline and clindamycin are slow-acting blood schizontocides for all species of plasmodia that infect humans. They do not affect hepatic stages. They are used in combination with quinine or artesunate for the treatment of P. falc ipar um malaria. Doxycycline can also be used alone as a chemoprophylactic agent for MDR strains of malaria. Tetracyclines should not be used in pregnancy and young children (younger than 8 years); clindamycin can be used safely in such cases.Treat ment of Malaria during Pregnancy: P vivax malaria is treated with chloroquine. For P falciparum malaria, quinine with clindamycin is administered in ﬁrst trimester; ACT in 2nd and 3rd trimesters. Doxycycline and primaquine are contraindicated in pregnancy.Treat ment of Mixed Infection due to both P falciparum and P vivax: It should be treated as P falciparum malaria with ACT regimen (except ACT regimen of artesunete /H11001 sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine as it is not effective against P vivax). A 14 day course of primaquine is also added.Antiamoebic Drugs  PH1.47Amoebiasis is a protozoal infection caused by E. histolytica, which is transmitted through faeco-oral route.Classiﬁcation (According to their Site of Action) 1. Luminal amoebicides: They are poorly absorbed after oral administration, hence attain high concentration in the bowel. They act on trophozoites in the gut lumen and kill them. (a) Amides: Diloxanide furoate and nitazoxanide (b) 8-Hydroxyquinolines: Iodoquinol, iodochlorhydroxyquin (c) Antibiotics: T etracyclines, paromomycin 2 .  Tissue amoebicides: They attain high concentration in blood and tissues following oral or parenteral administration. (a) Nitroimidazoles: M etr o nidaz ole,  tinidaz ole,  secnidaz ole,  o rnidaz ole,  satra-nidazole

44911—CHEMOTHERAPY (b) Alkaloids: Emetine, dehydroemetine (DHE) (c) 4-Aminoquinoline: ChloroquineAmong tissue amoebicides, nitroimidazoles and alkaloids are used for intestinal and extraintestinal amoebiasis. Chloroquine is used for extraintestinal amebiasis.NitroimidazolesMetronidazole.  Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole derivative which is highly effective against most anaerobic bacteria and several protozoa, such as E. histolytica, Giardia lam-blia and Trichomonas vaginalis. It helps in the extraction of guinea worm (Dracunculus medinensis).Mechanism of ActionMetronidazole (prodrug)Microorganism‘Nitro’ group of the drug accepts electrons from ferredoxinsGeneration of highly reactive nitro radicalDamagesmicrobial DNADeath of theorganism(cidal effect)enters
In the presence of oxygen (aerobes), highly reactive nitro radical cannot be generated; hence, it is ineffective against aerobes.Pharmacokinetics.  Metronidazole is available for oral, i.v. and topical administration. It is usually well absorbed in the small intestine after oral administration and poorly bound to plasma proteins. It diffuses well into the tissues including brain; therapeutic levels are achieved in various body ﬂuids – saliva, semen, vaginal secretion, bile, breast milk and CSF. Metronidazole is metabolized in liver and the metabolites are excreted mainly in urine.Adverse Effects.  Adverse effects are rarely severe to necessitate the discontinuation of the drug. 1. GIT: Anorexia, nausea, metallic taste, dry mouth, epigastric distress, abdominal cramps and occasionally vomiting. 2. Allergic reactions: These include skin rashes, urticaria, itching and ﬂushing. 3. CNS: Dizziness, vertigo, confusion, irritability, headache, rarely convulsions and ataxia may occur. Polyneuropathy may occur on prolonged therapy. 4 .  Disulﬁram-like reaction (nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, headache, ﬂushing, etc.) may occur if taken with alcohol; hence, the patient should be warned to avoid alcohol during treatment with metronidazole.T eratogenic effect is seen in experimental animals; hence, metronidazole should be avoided in pregnant women.Drug Interactions 1. Metronidazole potentiates the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and other oral coumarins by inhibiting their metabolism. There is prolongation of prothrombin time; hence, reduction of warfarin dose may be needed. 2. Metronidazole may potentiate lithium toxicity by decreasing the renal clearance of lithium.

Uses (Table 11.24) 1 .  Amoebiasis: Metronidazole (400–800 mg t.d.s. for 7–10 days) is the ﬁrst-line agent for the treatment of both intestinal and extraintestinal amoebiasis except in asymp-tomatic carriers (Table 11.24). As the metronidazole is almost completely absorbed in the small intestine, it is not effective as a luminal amebicide. 2. Trichomonas vaginitis: Metronidazole (400 mg t.d.s. orally for 7 days) is the drug of choice. Both sexual partners should be treated simultaneously. 3 .  Giardiasis: Metronidazole is very effective and is given orally (200 mg t.d.s. for 7 days). 4. Anaerobic infections: Metronidazole is highly effective in most of the anaerobic infections – pelvic inﬂammatory disease, lung abscess, intra-abdominal infection, etc., caused by B. fragilis, Clostridium and other anaerobic organisms. (a) In anaerobic brain abscess, metronidazole is often used in combination with a third-generation cephalosporin. (b) In antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis, metronidazole is effective. It is cheaper and less toxic than vancomycin. (c) Vincent’s angina: Metronidazole is combined usually with amoxicillin for treatment of Vincent’s angina (ulcerative gingival infection produced by  anaerobes). (d) In the treatment of H. pylori infection, metronidazole is useful in combina-tion with clarithromycin or amoxicillin and a proton pump inhibitor. (e) It is used for prophylaxis of colorectal surgery. 5. Others: It is used for treatment of bacterial vaginosis, extraction of guinea worm and Crohn’s disease. Other nitroimidazoles are shown in Table 11.25.Emetine GroupEmetine and Dehydroemetine (DHE).  Emetine is an alkaloid and DHE is a semisynthetic derivative. They are irritants, bitter in taste and nauseating, hence cannot be adminis-tered orally. They are administered through i.m. route. They kill tissue trophozoites and  have no effect on cysts. They are highly toxic and are used only when metronidazole is

contraindicated or if the patient is not responding to metronidazole. DHE is less toxic than emetine, hence preferred to emetine. It is administered in a dose of 60 mg once daily for 5 days. The duration of treatment should not exceed 10 days.Adverse Effects (Mnemonic: EMETINE) 1. Emesis (vomiting) – due to the stimulation of chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ). 2. Muscle weakness and stiffness. 3. ECG changes – T-wave inversion and prolongation of PR interval. 4. Tachycardia, hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias. 5. Itching and skin rashes. 6. Nausea. 7. Eczematoid lesions may occur at the injection site.Note: Patient should be hospitalized and advised to take bed rest during DHE therapy.

452PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES4-AminoquinolineChloroquine.  Chloroquine is effective in hepatic amebiasis. It is administered orally. It is completely absorbed from the upper GI tract and gets concentrated in liver. Chloroquine is not effective in intestinal amoebiasis because it attains low concentration in the gut wall and lumen. A luminal amoebicide has to be added to it when used for hepatic amoebiasis.AmidesDiloxanide Furoate.  Diloxanide furoate is a synthetic compound. The trophozoites in gut lumen which form cysts are killed by diloxanide furoate (luminal amoebicide). It is not effective against tissue trophozoites. After oral administration, diloxanide furoate in the gut is split into diloxanide and furoic acid. The diloxanide moiety is partly absorbed; the unabsorbed portion in the gut exerts antiamoebic activity. It is the drug of choice for asymptomatic amoebic carriers. In intestinal and extraintestinal amoebiasis, diloxanide furoate is given along with a tissue amoebicide for complete eradication of the organism (i.e. both trophozoites and cysts). Diloxanide furoate is administered in a dose of  500 mg t.d.s. for about 7–10 days. It is well tolerated and rarely causes side effects,  such as ﬂatulence, nausea and skin rashes.Nitazoxanide.  Nitazoxanide is a luminal amoebicide. It is converted to active metabolite (tizoxanide). It is useful orally in amoebiasis and giardiasis. Adverse effects are headache and GI disturbances.8-HydroxyquinolinesHydroxyquinolines were widely used as luminal amoebicides in the past for amoebiasis. They have been banned in various countries because of their toxicity, subacute myelo-optic neuropathy (SMON).AntibioticsT etracyclines.  They are luminal amoebicides. The unabsorbed portion of older tetracy-clines reaches colon and inhibits the bacterial ﬂora, which are required for survival of  E. histolytica.Paromomycin.  Paromomycin, an aminoglycoside, is a luminal amoebicide. It is not absorbed from the GI tract following oral administration. It alters the intestinal ﬂora. Adverse effects like nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain can occur. Oral paromomycin is safe for use in pregnancy. It is also useful in kala-azar.Treatment of Other Protozoal Infections  PH1.47, PH1.55Some of the protozoal infections with their clinical features, the preferred drug in those conditions with regimen and alternative drugs are mentioned in Table 11.26.Disease and  causative organismClinical featuresPreferred drug, route and doseAlternative drugsGiardiasis: Giardia lambliaDiarrhoea and  ﬂatulenceMetronidazole oral 200 mg t.d.s.  for 7 days• Tinidazole• Nitazoxanide• Furazolidone• ParomomycinTable 11.26  Treatment of other protozoal infections

aAlbendazole is highly active against many helminths, hence worth noting again.I AlbendazoleaI LevamisoleI PraziquantelI Diethylcarbamazine citrateNote: Mnemonic – MANIPAL PD.Mebendazole.  Mebendazole is a benzimidazole and has a broad spectrum of anthelmintic activity. It binds to /H9252-tubulin and inhibits microtubule polymerization. It also blocks glucose transport into the parasite. As a result, intestinal parasites are immobilized or die slowly.Pharmacokinetics.  Mebendazole is administered orally, poorly absorbed from the GI tract, highly bound to plasma proteins and metabolized in liver. Most of the oral dose is excreted in faeces.Adverse Effects.  Systemic toxicity of mebendazole is low because of its poor absorp-tion. It is well tolerated and rarely causes GI side effects – anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal discomfort. Occasionally, it may cause skin rashes, itching, drug fever, etc. It is contraindicated in pregnancy and children younger than 1 year.Uses.  Mebendazole is highly effective against intestinal nematodes – roundworm, hookworm, whipworm, pinworm and mixed worm infestations. It is more effective than albendazole in trichuriasis.Dose and Administration.  Mebendazole 100 mg orally b.d. for 3 days. It does not require fasting or purging, is well tolerated and is relatively cheap.Albendazole.  It is also a benzimidazole and has a broad spectrum of anthelmintic activity. The mechanism of action is similar to that of mebendazole.Pharmacokinetics.  Albendazole is given orally. It is erratically absorbed – fatty food increases its absorption; it is metabolized in liver. It produces an active metabolite, alben-dazole sulphoxide, which is widely distributed into various tissues including hydatid cyst. Hence, albendazole is preferred to mebendazole in the treatment of hydatid disease.Adverse Effects.  Albendazole is very well tolerated. The side effects are rare, but can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and epigastric distress. During long-term therapy, it may cause hepatic dysfunction, headache, dizziness, fever, weakness, loss of hair and neutropenia.Dose and Administration.  It can be taken as a single oral dose of 400 mg for adults and children older than 2 years, and as 200 mg single dose for children between 1 and  2 years of age. It is taken at any time of the day, does not require fasting or purging  and side effects are rare.Uses 1 . Nematodes: Albendazole is highly effective against intestinal nematodes – roundworm, hookworm, whipworm, pinworm and threadworm – and also in mixed worm infesta-tions. It is more effective than mebendazole in trichinosis. 2. Neurocysticercosis: Both albendazole and praziquantel are highly effective in neurocysticercosis. But albendazole is preferred to praziquantel because of the  following reasons: (a) It is cheaper. (b) Duration of treatment is shorter.

456PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES (c) It reaches high concentration in brain and CSF. (d) It is less toxic and better tolerated. (e) Glucocorticoids increase plasma levels of albendazole sulphoxide but decrease plasma praziquantel levels.High doses of glucocorticoids are usually given with albendazole or praziquantel to minimize the inﬂammatory reactions to dying parasites. Drug treatment is contraindicated in ocular cysticercosis – blindness can occur due to inﬂam-matory reaction. 3. Hydatid disease: In hydatid cyst, surgical resection is the treatment of choice, but albendazole is the drug of choice for medical therapy. 4. Filariasis: Single dose of (400 mg) albendazole is given with diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) or ivermectin in the treatment of lymphatic ﬁlariasis. Albendazole has adjuvant value.Albendazole is also effective in cutaneous larva migrans.Thiabendazole.  A benzimidazole, thiabendazole has a broad spectrum of anthelmintic activity and is effective against most of the nematodes. The mechanism of action  is similar to that of mebendazole and albendazole. It is rarely used because of high  incidence of toxicity.Piperazine.  It is effective against roundworm and pinworm. It causes ﬂaccid paralysis of worms that are later expelled by peristaltic movements. It is partly absorbed and  most of the drug is excreted unchanged in urine.Adverse Effects.  The adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, skin rashes and dizziness. It occasionally produces convulsions and is contraindicated in patients with epilepsy. It is safe for use during pregnancy.Levamisole.  It is effective against roundworm and hookworm infestations. It is an immunomodulator. It is also used as an adjunct in rheumatoid arthritis and cancer chemotherapy.Pyrantel Pamoate.  It is highly effective for the treatment of roundworm, pinworm and hookworm infestations. Oxantel pamoate is effective in trichuriasis.Mechanism of ActionPyrantel pamoateInhibits cholinesterases in worms↑↑ ACh concentrationStimulates nicotinicreceptors in the wormPersistent depolarizationSpastic paralysisWorms are expelled (vermifuge)Pharmacokinetics.  Pyrantel pamoate is given orally but absorbed poorly; about 80%–90% of oral dose is excreted in faeces.

45711—CHEMOTHERAPYDose and Administration.  It can be taken as a single oral dose of 11 mg/kg, does not require fasting or purging, is well tolerated and is relatively cheap.Adverse Effects.  These include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, dizziness, skin rashes and fever. It is contraindicated in infants.Diethylcarbamazine Citrate.  Diethylcarbamazine is the most effective drug used in the treatment of ﬁlariasis and tropical eosinophilia caused by W. bancrofti and B. malayi. DEC is available as citrate salt. It acts mainly on microﬁlariae but the adult worms are killed slowly only on long-term treatment. DEC damages the microﬁlarial membrane structure so that they are destroyed by host defences.Pharmacokinetics.  It is well absorbed from the GI tract, widely distributed in the body, metabolized in liver and excreted in urine. DEC is safe for use during pregnancy.Adverse Effects 1. Drug-induced effects: These include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, headache and dizziness. 2. Parasite-induced reactions: These are due to the release of proteins from dying parasites. In onchocerciasis, DEC produces a severe reaction, which is termed ‘Mazzotti’ reaction. It is characterized by severe itching, fever, skin rashes, nausea, vomiting, headache, joint pain, lymphadenitis, keratitis and uveitis. Hence, DEC is not recommended in onchocerciasis. In W. bancrofti, the reaction is usually mild. This can be minimized by administering H1-blockers. The reaction is treated with H1-blockers and glucocorticoids.Uses 1. Filariasis: Diethylcarbamazine is the drug of choice for the treatment of ﬁlariasis due to W. bancrofti and B. malayi. It is administered orally, 6 mg/kg/day in three divided doses for 3 weeks. (DEC 100 mg three times daily is taken after food for  3 weeks.) Addition of single dose of albendazole 400 mg to DEC produces  sustained microﬁlaricidal effect.Diethylcarbamazine (300 mg) with albendazole (400 mg) is used to reduce transmission of ﬁlariasis. 2. Tropical eosinophilia: It is treated with DEC, 100 mg t.d.s. for 3 weeks. Antihista-minics and glucocorticoids may be required to control allergic reactions.Ivermectin.  It is the drug of choice in onchocerciasis and strongyloidiasis. It is effective against microﬁlaria of W. bancrofti and B. malayi.Mechanism of Action
Hyperpolarization and paralysis of wormsDeath/phagocytosis of wormsIvermectinActivates glutamate-gated chloride channels  /circle6Increases GABA ( /circle6γ-aminobutyric acid) transmission in worms

458PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESPharmacokinetics.  It is given orally, rapidly absorbed, widely distributed to various tissues, metabolized in liver and excreted mainly in faeces.Uses 1. Ivermectin is the drug of choice for onchocerciasis. It kills microﬁlariae but has little effect on adult worms. It relieves pruritus and skin disease. 2 .  It is also very effective in strongyloidiasis, ascariasis and cutaneous larva migrans. 3. It is used orally in the treatment of scabies and pediculosis. 4. It is useful for mass chemotherapy of ﬁlariasis as single annual dose along with albendazole.Adverse Effects.  They are itching, skin rashes, oedema, headache, fever, muscle and joint pain. It can cause ‘Mazzotti’ reaction during treatment of ﬁlariasis. It is contrain-dicated in pregnancy and children.Praziquantel.  Praziquantel is effective in the treatment of trematodes and cestodes but not for nematodes.Mechanism of ActionPraziquantel  hh inﬂux of Ca2/H11001 into the tegument  increased muscular contraction  and spastic paralysisAt higher concentration  damages tegument  death of the parasitePharmacokinetics.  Praziquantel is readily absorbed after oral administration, under-goes extensive ﬁrst-pass metabolism in liver, is highly bound to plasma proteins, crosses the BBB and is excreted mainly in urine.Adverse Effects.  The most common side effect is dizziness. Other side effects are nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, headache, drowsiness, skin rashes, itching, muscle and joint pain.Uses 1. Schistosomiasis: Praziquantel is the drug of choice for all species of schistosomes. Praziquantel 40 mg/kg, single oral dose usually produces a high cure rate. It is well tolerated and reasonably cheap. 2. T apeworm infestation: A single oral dose of praziquantel gives a very high cure rate in all tapeworm infestations. 3. Neurocysticercosis (see under ‘“Albendazole’”): It is an alternative agent for neurocysticercosis.Praziquantel is contraindicated in pregnancy and ocular cysticercosis.Niclosamide.  It is the second drug of choice for T. saginata, D. latum and H. nana. It is poorly absorbed from the GI tract. It inhibits oxidative phosphorylation in the  mitochondria of the parasite and rapidly kills adult worms but not the ova. It is given orally in the form of chewable tablets.Adverse Effects.  Niclosamide produces few minor side effects. They are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, skin rashes, itching and abdominal discomfort.

Bone marrow, skin, hair, GI mucosa, reticuloendothelial system, gonads, fetus, etc., are most severely affected. 1. General toxicity (a) Bone marrow suppression: It manifests as leucopenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia and aplastic anaemia. In such patients, infection and bleeding are common.It is ameliorated/reduced by: (i) Platelet transfusion (ii) Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)

46111—CHEMOTHERAPY (iii) Erythropoietin (iv) Bone marrow transplantation (v) Using bone marrow-sparing drugs if possible (e.g. l-asparaginase, bleomycin, cisplatin and vincristine) (b) Immunosuppression: Decreased lymphocytes result in immunosuppression. Such patients are prone to opportunistic infections with fungi, bacteria,  viruses and parasites (P. jiroveci, Candida, cytomegalovirus, etc.). (c) GIT: Nausea and vomiting are due to central action (stimulation of CTZ) and peripheral action in the GI tract. Most of the cytotoxic drugs cause vomiting. Cisplatin has the most emetogenic potential. 5-HT3 antagonists, such as ondansetron and granisetron, are the commonly used antiemetics. The  other antiemetics are metoclopramide and dexamethasone. Stomatitis, oral mucositis, diarrhoea, GI bleeding and ulcers are due to necrosis of rapidly dividing epithelial cells of gut mucosa. (d) Skin and hair: Alopecia (loss of hair) is due to the damage to hair follicles. It is usually reversible on stoppage of therapy. Dermatitis and skin rashes too can occur. (e) Gonads: Cytotoxic drugs also affect gonadal cells and cause oligozoosper-mia and infertility in males, and amenorrhoea and infertility in  females. (f) Fetus: Administration of cytotoxic drugs during pregnancy usually causes abortion or teratogenic effects. (g) Hyperuricaemia: Gout and urate stones in the urinary tract are due to exces-sive cell destruction. They are prevented by good hydration, allopurinol and corticosteroids. (h) Hypercalcaemia: It may be due to either the malignancy or certain anticancer drugs. It is treated with adequate hydration, bisphosphonates, corticosteroids, etc. (i) Carcinogenicity (secondary malignancy): These drugs may rarely cause secondary cancers in some patients, e.g. development of leukaemia in patients with prolonged use of alkylating agents. (j) Mutagenicity. 2. Speciﬁc toxicity (a) Haemorrhagic cystitis with cyclophosphamide: Ameliorated by administering mesna systemically and acetylcysteine locally. (b) Megaloblastic anaemia with methotrexate: Ameliorated by folinic acid/leucovorin/citrovorum factor. (c) Nephrotoxicity with cisplatin: Saline infusion and mannitol reduce the incidence of nephrotoxicity. (d) Neuropathy with vincristine and paclitaxel. (e) Pulmonary fibrosis and pigmentation of skin with busulphan and bleomycin. (f) Cardiotoxicity with doxorubicin and daunorubicin. An iron chelating agent, dexrazoxane, is useful in reducing the toxicity.Alkylating AgentsAll alkylating agents have alkyl group(s) and are capable of introducing these groups into nucleophilic sites on DNA bases through the formation of covalent bonds. Alkylating agents are CCNS drugs. They also have radiomimetic effect.

Cyclophosphamide is a prodrug and is activated in liver (Fig. 11.17). The ﬁnal active metabolites derived from cyclophosphamide are phosphoramide  mustard and acrolein. Phosphoramide mustard produces cytotoxic effect and acrolein is responsible for haemorrhagic cystitis.Cyclophosphamide is administered orally or intravenously. The metabolites are  excreted mainly in urine.Adverse Effects.  Cyclophosphamide can cause general toxicity (see p. 460). The speciﬁc toxicity of cyclophosphamide is severe haemorrhagic cystitis. It is associated with dysuria and haematuria due to irritation of bladder mucosa by acrolein. It is a Cyclophosphamide(Prodrug)AldophosphamideAcrolein(Toxic metabolite)Phosphoramidemustard(Cytotoxic effect)

Mesna is also excreted in urine where it binds and inactivates acrolein, thus prevents haemorrhagic cystitis.Uses.  Cyclophosphamide is used in combination with other anticancer agents in the treatment of lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), breast cancer, etc. It also has a powerful immunosuppressant effect, hence is useful in rheumatoid arthritis, nephrotic syndrome and to prevent as well as to treat graft rejection during organ  transplantation.Ifosfamide is a congener of cyclophosphamide and is administered intravenously. It is useful in the treatment of testicular cancer and sarcomas.Mechlorethamine.  It is one of the components of MOPP (nitrogen mustard, Oncovin, prednisone and procarbazine) regimen for Hodgkin disease. It is a highly irritant drug so care should be taken to avoid extravasation during i.v. administration.Chlorambucil.  It is a slow-acting nitrogen mustard. Its main action is on lymphoid series and it produces marked lympholytic effect. It is given orally and was the standard treatment for CLL.Melphalan.  It is highly effective in multiple myeloma and is used in combination with other agents.Alkyl SulphonatesBusulphan.  It depresses bone marrow with selective action on myeloid series. It was the preferred drug for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). The common side effects are pigmentation of the skin, interstitial pulmonary ﬁbrosis and hyperuricaemia.NitrosoureasCarmustine and lomustine are highly lipid soluble drugs, hence reach high concentra-tion in the CSF. Nitrosoureas are mainly used in brain tumours.Procarbazine.  It is an alkylating agent. It damages DNA and is a component of MOPP regimen for Hodgkin disease.Platinum-Containing CompoundsCisplatin.  It is a heavy-metal complex with a highly effective antineoplastic activity. It is a CCNS drug and acts on both dividing and resting cells. Cisplatin is administered intravenously. It is highly bound to plasma proteins and gets concentrated in kidney, liver, intestine and testes. It poorly penetrates BBB and is slowly excreted in urine.Mechanism of Action.  Inside the cell:CisplatinForms highly reactive platinum complexesReacts with DNA(Forms both intrastrand and interstrand cross-links)DNA damage

464PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESCisplatin is highly effective in the treatment of testicular, ovarian, endometrial and bladder cancer. It is also used in lung and oesophageal cancer.Adverse Effects.  Cisplatin is the most emetogenic anticancer drug. Nausea and vomiting can be controlled by 5-HT3 antagonists, such as ondansetron or granisetron.Nephrotoxicity: It can be minimized by proper hydration.Ototoxicity with hearing loss can occur and is severe with repeated doses.Electrolyte disturbances: Hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia are common. Neuropathy is commonly seen with higher doses. Anaphylactic shock may rarely occur. Cisplatin has mutagenic, teratogenic and carcinogenic properties.Carboplatin.  The mechanism of action is similar to that of cisplatin. It is better tolerated than cisplatin. It causes less nausea, ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity than cisplatin.Oxaliplatin.  It is effective in colorectal and gastric cancer. Peripheral neuropathy is an important adverse effect.ANTIMETABOLITESFolate AntagonistMethotrexate.  MTX is one of the most commonly used anticancer drugs. It is a CCS drug and acts during S phase of the cell cycle. It has antineoplastic, immunosuppressant and anti-inﬂammatory effects.Mechanism of ActionMethotrexateDihydrofolic acid(DHFA)Dihydrofolate reductase
DNA and RNA synthesisLeucovorinFolinic acid(N5–formyl FH4)Citrovorum factor/H17054(DHFR)T etrahydrofolic acid(THFA)Synthesis of purines andthymidylateMTX structurally resembles folic acid. It competitively inhibits dihydrofolate reduc-tase enzyme and prevents the conversion of dihydrofolic acid (DHFA) to THFA, thus depletes the intracellular THFA. THFA is necessary for the synthesis of purines and thymidylate which, in turn, are necessary for DNA and RNA synthesis.MTX is well absorbed after oral administration; it can also be given i.m., i.v. or intra-thecally. It is bound to plasma proteins; it poorly crosses the BBB and most of the drug is excreted unchanged in urine.MTX is the drug of choice for choriocarcinoma. It is also used in acute leukaemias, Burkitt lymphoma and breast cancer.Low-dose MTX 7.5–25 mg once weekly is used for rheumatoid arthritis. It prevents joint erosion. It has anti-inﬂammatory and immunosuppressant effects. It is also used in psoriasis, inﬂammatory bowel disease and organ transplantation.

46511—CHEMOTHERAPYAdverse Effects.  See general toxicity (p. 460). Other adverse effects are megaloblastic anaemia, pancytopaenia, hepatic ﬁbrosis, etc.Drug Interactions.  Salicylates/sulphonamides/tetracyclines /H11003 MTX: These drugs displace MTX bound to plasma proteins and increase its free form in plasma leading to its toxicity.NSAIDs and sulphonamides potentiate MTX toxicity by interfering with its  excretion.Folinic Acid Rescue/Leucovorin Rescue.  The toxic effects of MTX on normal cells can be minimized by giving folinic acid. Availability of folinic acid has helped the use of very high doses of MTX for a better antineoplastic effect. After a few hours of MTX therapy, leucovorin is given. Folinic acid is the active coenzyme form. It bypasses the block pro-duced by MTX and rapidly reverses the toxicity. This method is called leucovorin rescue/folinic acid rescue.Pemetrexed: It affects thymidylate synthase more than dihydrofolate reductase. Hand-foot syndrome can occur.Purine Antagonists: 6-Mercaptopurine and 6-Thioguanine6-MP and 6-TG are activated to their ribonucleotides which inhibits purine ring  biosynthesis and nucleotide interconversion. They are CCS drugs and act in S phase  of cell cycle. 6-MP also has immunosuppressant action.6-MP is administered orally and has poor penetration through BBB. It is metabolized by xanthine oxidase and its metabolite is excreted in urine.Allopurinol6-MercaptopurineXanthine oxidase6-Thiouric acid/H17054Allopurinol interferes with the metabolism of 6-MP by inhibiting the enzyme xanthine oxidase and increases the antineoplastic effect of 6-MP . Therefore, allopurinol is frequently used in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy to prevent hyperuricaemia and to reduce the dose of 6-MP , thus reducing its toxicity. 6-MP is used mainly in  acute lymphocytic leukaemia. Bone marrow depression is the major adverse effect  of 6-MP .Pyrimidine AntagonistsFluorouracil (5-FU).  5-FU is activated to ﬂuorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) (Fig. 11.18). This interferes with DNA synthesis and functions by inhibiting thymidylate synthetase enzyme.It is used in colorectal, upper GIT, breast and ovarian carcinomas.Capecitabine. It is a prodrug of 5-FU. It is useful in metastatic breast and colorectal cancer. Hand-foot syndrome is an important adverse effect.Cytarabine. It inhibits DNA synthesis. It is used in leukaemias and lymphoma.Plant ProductsVinca Alkaloids.  Vinblastine and vincristine are derived from the periwinkle plant. They are CCS agents and act during M phase of cell cycle. Vinblastine and vincristine have the same mechanism of action but differ in antitumour spectrum and toxicity (Table 11.28).

It is useful in advanced breast, ovarian, lung, oesophageal and bladder cancer. The unwanted effects are bone marrow suppres-sion, peripheral neuropathy, myalgia and hypersensitivity reactions.CamptothecinsT opotecan and irinotecan are camptothecin analogues.Mechanism of Action.  Camptothecins bind to and stabilize DNA–topoisomerase I complex and inhibit the resealing function (the strand-breaking action is not affected), thus producing cell death. They are used in advanced ovarian, lung and colorectal  cancer. The common side effects are bone marrow suppression and GI disturbances.

It is also effective in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma. The side effects are bone marrow suppression and GI side effects such as nausea, vomit-ing and diarrhoea. Hepatotoxicity is seen with high doses.Anticancer AntibioticsMechanism of Action.  Anticancer antibiotics have a direct action on DNA. Dactinomy-cin, doxorubicin and daunorubicin bind to DNA through intercalation between adjoining nucleotide pairs on the same strand of DNA and block transcription of DNA. Bleomycin binds to DNA and produces free radicals which cause DNA damage.Actinomycin D.  It is administered intravenously. It is mainly used in the treatment of Wilms tumour, Ewing sarcoma and choriocarcinoma. Bone marrow suppression and GI side effects are prominent.Mitomycin C.  It is converted to a compound which acts as an alkylating agent. It is used in the treatment of GI tumours, cervix and bladder cancer. It produces mainly bone marrow suppression, GI side effects and nephrotoxicity.Bleomycin.  It can be administered through s.c., i.m. and i.v. routes. It is used in the treat-ment of testicular and ovarian tumours and in Hodgkin lymphoma (ABVD* regimen). Its main side effects are hyperpigmentation of the skin and pulmonary ﬁbrosis. There is very little bone marrow suppression (spares bone marrow).Doxorubicin and Daunorubicin.  Daunorubicin is effective in acute leukaemias; doxorubi-cin is active against solid tumours. The side effects are bone marrow suppression, GI disturbances and cardiomyopathy with CCF, hypotension or arrhythmias.Mithramycin.  It is an anticancer antibiotic that reduces serum calcium levels by inhibit-ing osteoclasts. It is used in the treatment of hypercalcaemia with bone metastasis.EnzymeL-Asparaginase.  It is an enzyme that is isolated from bacteria, E. coli. Asparagine is an amino acid which is necessary for protein synthesis. Normal cells can synthesize aspara-gine because they contain asparagine synthetase enzyme. Cancer cells lack this enzyme, so they depend on exogenous source – plasma.L-AsparaginaseAsparagine Aspartic acid*Adriamycin (doxorubicin), bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine

Haemorrhage: Due to inhibition of synthesis of clotting factors 5. PancreatitisMiscellaneous AgentsHydroxyurea.  Hydroxyurea acts in the S phase of cell cycle (CCS drug).Mechanism of Action.  Hydroxyurea interferes with the conversion of ribonucleotide to deoxyribonucleotide by inhibiting ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase. This results in inhibition of DNA synthesis. It is used mainly in CML, polycythaemia vera and pso-riasis. The common side effects are bone marrow suppression with leucopenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia.Other anticancer drugs are shown in Table 11.29.

46911—CHEMOTHERAPYHormones and Hormone Antagonists 1. Glucocorticoids: Because of their marked lympholytic action, they are used in acute leukaemias and lymphomas. Apart from this effect, glucocorticoids: (a) Have anti-inﬂammatory effect, decrease oedema associated with the tumour (b) Produce feeling of well-being (c) Suppress hypersensitivity reaction due to certain anticancer drugs (d) Control hypercalcaemia (e) Increase the antiemetic effect of ondansetron/granisetron/metoclopramideBecause of the above effects, glucocorticoids are useful in the treatment of various cancers. 2. Oestrogens: The oestrogens are physiological antagonists of androgens. Hence, they are used to antagonize the effects of androgens in androgen-dependent pros-tatic tumours. Fosfestrol is a prodrug which is activated to stilboestrol in prostatic tissue. It achieves high concentration in prostatic tissue, therefore is preferred in carcinoma of prostate. 3. T amoxifen: This is an antioestrogen mainly used in the palliative treatment of hormone-dependent breast carcinoma. 4. Progestins: The progestins are useful in endometrial carcinoma. 5 .  Antiandrogens: Flutamide is a nonsteroidal agent that blocks the action of androgen at the receptor level. 6. Finasteride: This blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone by inhibiting 5/H9251-reductase.Both ﬂutamide and ﬁnasteride are useful for the palliative treatment of  advanced carcinoma of prostate. Finasteride is also effective in BPH. 7. Aromatase inhibitors: They are used in hormone-dependent breast cancer in postmenopausal women. 8. GnRH agonists: The pulsatile administration of these agents (buserelin, goserelin, leuprolide, etc.) produces a rise in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and  luteinizing hormone (LH). Continuous administration, however, suppresses  the pituitary gonadotropins by downregulating GnRH receptors. These agents produce palliative effects in advanced prostatic and breast cancers.

47112—MISCELLANEOUS DRUGSDIMERCAPROLIt was developed as an antidote for arsenic containing war gases, such as lewisite during World War II. The sulphydryl (SH) groups of dimercaprol (BAL) react with metals to form a complex. It is administered intramuscularly. It is used in arsenic, mercury, gold and bismuth poisoning; also used as an adjuvant in copper and lead poisoning.Adverse Effects.  Nausea, vomiting, headache, fever, salivation, rise in BP , tachycardia and pain at the site of injection.Succimer (2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid, DMSA) and unithiol (DMPS) are analogues of dimercaprol. They are effective orally, less toxic and are used in the treatment of  arsenic, mercury and lead poisoning.DISODIUM EDETATEOn intravenous (i.v.) administration, it chelates calcium and causes hypocalcaemic tet-any. It can be used in the treatment of hypercalcaemia and as an anticoagulant in vitro.CALCIUM DISODIUM EDETATEIt is preferred in the treatment of lead poisoning, as it does not deplete calcium. Calcium in the chelating agent is exchanged with heavy metal. It can also be used in zinc, copper and manganese poisoning. It is infused intravenously.Adverse Effects. Calcium EDTA is toxic to kidney. The other side effects are fatigue, fever, myalgia, headache, nausea, vomiting, etc.DESFERRIOXAMINE (DEFEROXAMINE)It is an iron-chelating agent. It is not effective orally as it is poorly absorbed from gastrointestinal tract (GIT). It is administered parenterally (i.m./i.v.). It chelates iron from haemosiderin and ferritin, but does not affect iron in haemoglobin or cyto-chrome. Afﬁnity for calcium is low. Intravenous desferrioxamine is the drug of choice for acute iron poisoning. It can be used intravenously to chelate aluminium during dialy-sis. It is used intramuscularly for chronic iron poisoning (thalassaemia).Adverse Effects. It includes various allergic reactions, such as skin rashes, itching, ﬂushing and anaphylaxis. Other adverse effects are diarrhoea, dyspnoea, dysuria, hypo-tension and tachycardia. It can cause neurotoxicity on long-term use. It is contraindi-cated in pregnancy and renal insufﬁciency.DEFERIPRONEIt is an orally effective iron-chelating agent. It is used in the treatment of transfusion  siderosis in thalassaemia and acute iron poisoning (less effective than desferrioxamine).Adverse Effects.  Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, joint pain and rarely agranulocytosis.DEFERASIROXIt is administered orally in chronic iron overload. Nausea, rash and epigastric distress are some of its adverse effects.

48312—MISCELLANEOUS DRUGSMineralsMinerals are inorganic compounds required for normal body functions. Sodium, potas-sium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, etc. are required in large amounts, hence are major minerals. Iron, iodine, zinc, copper, ﬂuorine, etc. are required in minute quanti-ties, hence are trace elements.SODIUMIt is widely distributed in the extracellular ﬂuid (ECF; 130–145 mEq/L). The daily require-ment of sodium is about 5–10 g/day. It maintains ECF volume, acid–base balance, excit-ability of muscle and nerve tissues. Sodium chloride (common salt) is used to improve the palatability of food. Sodium is lost from the body mainly through urine and sweat.Excessive loss of sodium can lead to hyponatraemia. Severe sweating, diuretic therapy, burns, diarrhoea, etc. are some of the causes of hyponatraemia. The signs and symptoms are anorexia, muscle cramps, hypotension, tachycardia, etc. It can be treated by giving salt through food or normal saline (0.9%) intravenously. Increased sodium level in the blood is hypernatraemia. Common causes are congestive cardiac failure, kidney diseases, etc. The manifestations are oedema, altered mental status, rise in blood pressure, etc. It can be treated with salt-restricted diet and loop diuretics.POTASSIUMIt is an important constituent of intracellular ﬂuid. Normal serum potassium level is  3.5–5 mEq/L. The important sources are tender coconut water, banana, orange, nuts, etc. It is required for maintenance of muscular and neuronal activity. It also helps in regulating acid–base balance, ﬂuid and electrolyte balance. Serum potassium less than 3 mEq/L is  hypokalaemia. Common causes are excessive sweating, severe vomiting and diarrhoea, diabetic ketoacidosis, diuretic therapy (thiazides and loop diuretics), renal diseases, etc. The clinical features are muscular weakness, lethargy, arrhythmias, hypotension, etc. It can be corrected by oral potassium salts (oral potassium should be administered by diluting in a tumbler full of water to prevent intestinal ulceration). In severe cases, potassium can be in-jected slow intravenously, as it has cardiac depressant effect. Serum potassium more than  5 mEq/L is hyperkalaemia. Renal failure, drugs (nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs, an-giotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretics, etc.), tissue damage due to trauma, burns, etc. are some of the common causes of hyperkalaemia. It can cause cardiac arrhythmias, paralysis of skeletal muscles and cardiac arrest. Drugs used to treat hyperkalaemia are 10% calcium gluconate, salbutamol/terbutaline (selective /H9252-agonists), regular insulin with glucose (insulin facilitates the shift of potassium into cells), sodium bi-carbonate and sodium polystyrene sulphonate. Severe cases can be treated by haemodialysis.MAGNESIUMIt is mainly present in bones and teeth. The daily requirement of magnesium is 0.3–0.35 g/day. The important sources are green leafy vegetables, ﬁsh, coconut, food grain, etc. The action of magnesium depends on the route of administration as depicted in Fig. 12.1.Uses 1. As an antacid: Magnesium salts (magnesium trisilicate and magnesium hydroxide) are used commonly with aluminium salts. 2. As a purgative: Magnesium salts are used as osmotic purgative.

Magnesium sulphate can be used topically to relieve local oedema.Hypermagnesaemia is treated with 10% calcium gluconate slow intravenously. Hypomagnesaemia is treated with magnesium salts.ZINCIt is a cofactor of many enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase, carbonic anhydrase,  lactate dehydrogenase, etc. Egg, meat, liver, pulses, cereals, fruits, nuts, vegetables, etc. are important sources of zinc. Salts like zinc oxide, sulphate and carbonate have antiseptic and astringent actions. Deﬁciency of zinc causes delayed wound healing, alopecia,  dermatitis, growth retardation, etc.Preparations 1. Zinc oxide: It is used topically in eczema, haemorrhoids, skin infections, for wounds and nappy rash in children. 2. Zinc sulphate: It is used to facilitate healing of ulcers and conjunctivitis. It is used orally in acute diarrhoea as it helps to heal intestinal epithelium; thus decreasing the frequency and severity of diarrhoeal episodes. 3. Zinc carbonate: It is a major component in calamine lotion. It is available as a lotion and powder and can be used for eczema, sunburns, skin rashes, etc.PHOSPHORUSThe important sources of phosphorus are ﬁsh, meat, egg, milk, pulses and cereals. The daily requirement of phosphorus is 0.8–1 g/day. It is required for the formation of bone and teeth along with calcium. It also helps in the maintenance of acid–base balance.  Hypophosphataemia may occur due to dietary deﬁciency of phosphorus, chronic use of antacids (aluminium hydroxide and calcium carbonate), hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D deﬁciency, diabetic ketoacidosis, chronic alcoholism, etc. Clinical features are anorexia, muscle weakness, pain in muscle and bones. It can be treated by management of underly-ing disease and administration of phosphorus salts orally or intravenously depending on the severity. Hyperphosphataemia may occur in hyperparathyroidism, renal failure, etc. 

48512—MISCELLANEOUS DRUGSThe signs and symptoms include hypocalcaemia and bone resorption. It can be treated by administration of calcium carbonate and aluminium hydroxide. They retard the absorp-tion of phosphorus from the gut.IRON (SEE P. 297)CALCIUM (SEE P. 354)Vaccines and Antisera  PH1.54Various immunizing agents are vaccines, immunoglobulins and antisera.

It provides passive immunity.T etanus immune globulinIt provides passive protection against tetanus. It is administered intramuscularly for prophylaxis against tetanus in persons with contaminated wounds who are either not immunized or immunization history is not known.Drugs Used in Common Skin Diseases  PH1.57Drugs used for treatment of skin diseases are administered topically or by systemic routes. T opical administration of drugs results in delivery of drug directly to desired site of action with minimal systemic side effects. High lipid solubility, inﬂammation, occlusive bandage and hydration increase penetration of drugs into skin. Drug penetration is slow in areas where skin is thick (palm, sole, etc.). Some of the preparations are discussed below. 1. Astringents: They precipitate surface proteins and form a protective coat, e.g. zinc oxide (for eczema, wounds and nappy rash), tannic acid (for bleeding gums and  haemorrhoids) and alcohol (to prevent bed sores). 2. Adsorbents and protectives: They are insoluble, ﬁnely divided powders which can bind toxic/irritant substances, e.g. activated charcoal (to adsorb toxic substances in GIT), topical sucralfate (on ulcers and wounds), aloe vera gel (as cosmetic  preparation), calamine (as an antipruritic and as a cosmetic) and dimethicone (as an antiﬂatulent). 3. Counterirritants: Certain agents on topical application can cause irritation of sensory nerve endings and relieve pain in underlying tissues and joint supplied by the same nerve, e.g. methyl salicylate (for muscle and joint pain), capsaicin, turpentine oil. 4. Demulcents: They form a protective coating on the inﬂamed skin or mucous membrane and produce soothing effect, e.g. liquorice, lozenges, troche (nystatin), glycerine, etc. 5. Emollients: They are fatty or oily substances, which produce soothing effect on the skin. On application to the skin, they protect it from irritation, prevent drying, render it soft, e.g. liquid parafﬁn, olive oil, waxes, etc. 6. Keratolytics: They are used to soften and desquamate the superﬁcial layers of the skin, e.g. salicylic acid, urea, propylene glycol, etc. They are used for warts and chronic dermatitis. 7. Antipruritics: These agents are used to relieve itching, e.g. antihistamines, gluco-corticoids, calamine lotion, etc. 8. Sunscreen: They are preparations that prevent damage to skin by sun rays. Chemi-cal sunscreens, e.g. octisalate, avobenzone, octinoxate, etc. absorb sun rays. Physical  sunscreen, e.g. zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, etc. deﬂect sun rays.

488PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATES 9. Melanizing agents: They are used to promote pigmentation of depigmented areas of skin, e.g. vitiligo. They sensitize skin to sunlight and activate melanocytes. After drug administration (either oral or topical on the affected area), the affected area is ex-posed to sunlight. Examples include trioxsalen and methoxsalen. Prolonged exposure can cause blisters. 10. Demelanizing agents: They decrease pigmentation of hyperpigmented areas of the skin. They act by inhibiting melanin synthesis. Hydroquinone and monoben-zone are used topically in melasma and hyperpigmented areas of skin.Drugs Used for the Treatment of Psoriasis  PH1.57Psoriasis is a chronic skin disorder characterized by erythematous, scaling plaques in the skin. T opical and systemic therapy is used for the treatment of psoriasis (Table 12.8).TherapyImportant pointsAdverse effects1. Topical therapy   i. Topical steroidsHydrocortisone,  clobetasol, triam-cinolone, beta-methasone• Anti-inﬂammatory, immuno-suppressant, antiproliferative actions• Low-potency steroids (e.g. hydrocortisone 1%) for lesions on the face• Potent steroids (betametha-sone 0.05%) are used for thick plaquesLocal and systemic side  effects:• Cutaneous: Atrophy of the skin, telangiectasia, striae, alteration in pig-mentation and delayed wound healing.• Systemic: Hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis suppression. Chronic use and high potency steroids  increase the risk of HPA axis suppression. ii.

Drugs for Acne Vulgaris  PH1.57Acne vulgaris is a skin disorder commonly affecting adolescents and young adults. There is an increase in production of sebum by sebaceous glands. This favours the growth of Propionibacterium acnes which act on lipids present in sebum resulting in production of irritant fatty acids. These fatty acids cause inflammation. In addi-tion, there is increased keratinization leading to blockade of follicles and formation of  comedones.Acne vulgaris can be treated with topical or systemically administered drugs.

490PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATEST opical TherapyI Retinoids: T opical retinoids include tretinoin, adapalene and tazarotene. They bind to nuclear receptors in keratinocytes to normalize differentiation. Retinoids decrease microcomedone formation. T opical tretinoin is not stable in the presence of benzyl peroxide. Hence, it should not be applied together with benzyl peroxide simultaneously. Adapalene can be used in combination with benzyl peroxide. The common adverse effect of topical retinoids is irritation.I Antimicrobials: Clindamycin, erythromycin and nadiﬂoxacin are useful topically – they decrease P. acnes population in the skin. They are used in combination with benzyl peroxide or retinoids.I Benzoyl peroxide: It has comedolytic, keratolytic and oxidizing activities. It is ac-tive against P. acnes. Since it prevents development of resistance, it is commonly used in combination therapy of acne. Skin irritation can occur.I Azelaic acid: It is active against P. acnes and has comedolytic property.Systemic therapy is required in severe cases of acne vulgaris.I Isotretinoin (oral) is used in severe cases of acne. It inhibits comedone formation. Adverse effects are dry skin, cheilitis, desquamation and photosensitivity. It has high teratogenic potential.I Antimicrobials: Oral antimicrobials like tetracyclines, minocycline, erythromycin and clindamycin are useful in moderate to severe acne. Long-term use is not rec-ommended to prevent development of resistance.Drug Therapy of Scabies and Pediculosis  PH1.57Scabies, a contagious skin infestation caused by Sarcoptes scabiei (itch mite), is character-ized by intense itching and rash. The parasite penetrates epidermis and burrows along the skin, laying eggs in it. The lesions are mainly in the webs of the ﬁngers, hand, wrist, fore-arm, legs, genitalia, trunk, etc. All the family members should be treated simultaneously.Pediculosis is an infestation caused by lice. It can involve the head (pediculosis capitis), pubic hair (pediculosis pubis) and body (pediculosis corporis). The eggs (nits) get attached to the hair.Agents used to kill parasites that live on the exterior (body surface) are ectoparasiticides. Drugs used in the treatment of scabies and pediculosis are mentioned in Table 12.9.DrugFormulationsDetailsPermethrin1% and 5% cream5% lotion5% gel1% soapMost efﬁcacious and most frequently used drug for scabies and pediculosis (head and pubic lice).For scabies: 5% Permethrin is applied to the skin over the body from neck to toes followed by a bath after 10–12 hours to wash off the drug.For pediculosis: 1% Permethrin is applied to the scalp/pubis and washed off after 10 minutes. Treatment may be repeated, if necessary, after 1 week.Side effects are skin rashes, redness, itching, burning, etc.Table 12.9  Drugs used in the treatment of scabies and pediculosis

49512—MISCELLANEOUS DRUGSDrug Dosage Forms  PH1.3Drugs can be administered to a patient in various forms. They are available as solid, semisolid and liquid dosage forms.SOLID DOSAGE FORMSSolid dosage forms of a drug are tablet, capsule, powder, suppository, troche, lozenge, etc. (Box 12.1).
Fig. 12.2  (a) Tablet (b) Scored tablets (c) Capsule.(a)(b)(c)Box 12.1 I Solid dosage formsI TabletI CapsuleI TrocheI LozengeI SuppositoryI PowderTabletIt is the commonly used solid dosage form (Fig. 12.2 a, b). A tablet may be scored and can be broken along the line, if required, e.g. paracetamol. Tablets can be uncoated or coated (covered with a thin ﬁlm of another substance) to improve its taste, delay absorp-tion, prevent its degradation in the stomach, etc. Sugar-coating of a tablet helps to  improve its taste, e.g. metronidazole.I Enteric-coated tablet: It is coated with a material that delays the release of medica-tion till it reaches the intestine. Enteric coating of a drug prevents the destruction of the drug by gastric acid, e.g. enteric-coated tablet of erythromycin, or decreases the gastric irritation by the drug, e.g. enteric-coated tablet of diclofenac.I Sustained-release preparation: It helps to prolong the duration of action of a drug, thereby decreasing the frequency of drug administration and improving patient compliance, e.g. sustained release tablet of diclofenac (for pain).Enteric-coated and sustained-release tablets should not be crushed.I Chewable tablet: It should be chewed and swallowed. This helps to increase the effectiveness of the drug, e.g. chewable antacid tablet used for gastritis and chew-able albendazole tablet for worm infestation.I Dispersible tablet: It is a tablet that has to be dispersed in water before administra-tion, e.g. dispersible tablet of aspirin.I Mouth dissolving tablet: It is placed on the tongue - disintegrates rapidly within few seconds, eg. mouth dissolving tablet of ondansetron. It is easy to administer,  convenient for patient and water is not required for swallowing. The tablet should  be handled carefully. It is not suitable for patients with dry mouth (eg. those on  anticholinergics)

496PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESCapsuleIt is a solid dosage form where the drug is enclosed within a soluble sheath. Capsules can be oval, cylindrical or spherical (Fig. 12.2c), e.g. amoxicillin.Sustained-release and enteric-coated capsules are also available. Spansules and timsules are sustained-release forms. Time-release forms may have the sufﬁx like SR (sustained release), CR (controlled release), ER (extended release), SA (sustained action), contin (continuous), retard, etc. Some capsules, eg. venlafaxine(antidepressant) extended release capsules, can be opened, contents sprinkled on soft food and swallowed (not chewed)  immediately followed by a glass of water.TrocheIt is a solid dosage form to be placed in the mouth where they dissolve slowly to liberate the active ingredient, e.g. clotrimazole troche for oral candidiasis (oral thrush).LozengeIt is a solid dosage form placed in the mouth and sucked; it dissolves slowly to liberate the active ingredient. It soothes the irritated mucosa of the throat. Some of the lozenges have systemic effect, e.g. nicotine lozenges to reduce withdrawal symptoms and craving associated with cessation of smoking; dyclonine (local anaesthetic) lozenge for sore throat.SuppositoryIt is a solid dosage form, either cylindrical or cone shaped, that is inserted into the rec-tum, urethra or vagina. It is solid at room temperature, but readily melts at body tem-perature. A suppository is to be stored in a refrigerator (not to be freezed), e.g. bisacodyl suppository for constipation.Pessary: It is a vaginal suppository, e.g. nystatin pessary for vaginal candidiasis.PowderIt is the ﬁnely divided form of a drug for internal or external use, e.g. oral rehydration salt (ORS) powder for dehydration; a combination of neomycin polymyxin B and baci-tracin (neosporin) in powder form for external application to skin as antiseptic (anti-bacterial agent); antifungal agents for athletes foot.LIQUID DOSAGE FORMSDifferent types of liquid dosage forms are discussed below (Box 12.2).Box 12.2 I Liquid dosage formsI MixtureI EmulsionI SuspensionI SyrupI ElixirI LinctusI GargleI Mouth rinseI LinimentI LotionI TinctureI Irrigation solutionI DropsI Spray

49712—MISCELLANEOUS DRUGSMixtureIt is a liquid containing two or more ingredients for oral use, e.g. gripe water mixture used in infants to reduce griping and carminative mixture to expel gas from stomach and intestine.EmulsionIt is a mixture of two immiscible liquids made miscible by using an emulsifying agent, e.g. cod liver oil emulsion for vitamin D deﬁciency.SuspensionIt contains one or more insoluble ingredients suspended in a liquid, e.g. antacid suspen-sion. It should be shaken well before use.SyrupIt is a concentrated solution of sugar containing the drug to mask the bitter taste of drug, e.g. cough syrup.ElixirIt is a clear, ﬂavoured liquid dosage form that contains a drug dissolved in water and alcohol, e.g. promethazine elixir for suppressing dry cough.LinctusIt is a viscous liquid preparation. It is usually used for relief of cough, e.g. linctus codeine.LinimentIt is a liquid preparation containing alcohol, oil or soap as vehicle meant for application to the skin with friction for sprain, joint pain, myalgia, etc., e.g. turpentine liniment. Liniment should not be applied to bruised skin or wounds.LotionIt is a liquid preparation meant for application to skin without friction, e.g. calamine lotion for eczema, sunburn, etc.TinctureIt is an alcoholic preparation of a drug, e.g. tincture iodine used as an antiseptic.DropsThey are liquid preparations meant for oral (vitamin drops, paracetamol drops) or local (eye, ear and nose) administration.SprayIt discharges the drug in droplet form for topical application—nose (nasal deconges-tants), skin (diclofenac), etc., or for systemic effect (e.g. nitroglycerin lingual spray).SEMISOLID DOSAGE FORMSDifferent types of semisolid dosage forms are discussed below (Box 12.3).

498PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESOintmentIt is a semisolid preparation having a greasy base for application to the skin or mucosa, e.g. neomycin ointment for skin and eye infections. It can also be used for systemic  effect, e.g. nitroglycerin ointment for angina pectoris.CreamIt is a semisolid emulsion for local application, e.g. ketoconazole cream for fungal infec-tions; glucocorticoid (betamethasone) intraoral cream for severe aphthous stomatitis, etc.PasteIt is a semisolid preparation with a less greasy base generally meant for topical use, e.g. triamcinolone acetonide paste for oral inﬂammatory lesions. Pastes are stiffer and easily washable than ointments.GelIt is a jelly-like substance formed by aqueous suspension of insoluble drugs, e.g. diclof-enac gel for pain, lignocaine gel as a local anaesthetic, povidone iodine gel for sore throat, glucocorticoid (betamethasone) gel for severe aphthous stomatitis, etc.INJECTABLE DOSAGE FORMSThe drugs to be administered as injections are available as powder (e.g. benzyl penicillin G), suspension (e.g. procaine penicillin G) and solution (e.g. adrenaline). Those avail-able as powder have to be mixed with diluent (reconstituted) before administration to the patient. All instructions should be read carefully before injecting a drug.Calculation of Dosage of Drugs  PH1.12WEIGHTS AND MEASURESMetric SystemIt is a commonly used system of measurement today.

50112—MISCELLANEOUS DRUGSLiquid Dosage FormsProblem 1: Doctor has prescribed 75 mg of paracetamol syrup for a child. It is available as 125 mg/5 mL syrup. How much of the syrup is to be administered to the child?125 mg is contained in 5 mL. Therefore, 75 mg is contained in512575 3/H11003/H11005So, 3 mL of the syrup is to be administered to the child.Liquid dosage forms can be administered orally with a measuring cup, dropper, tea-spoon or tablespoon. Measuring cups are calibrated in millilitre or ounce. Droppers are calibrated in millilitre. The dose of the liquids should always be measured at the lowest point of the meniscus.CALCULATION OF DOSAGE OF PARENTERALLY ADMINISTERED FLUIDSStrength of SolutionConcentration of solutions can be expressed as percent or ratios. The percentage concen-tration of solutions can be expressed as given below: 1. Percent weight in volume (w/v), i.e. ‘w’ g (weight) of solute in ‘v’ mL (volume) of solution, e.g. 1% w/v solution contains 1 g of solute in 100 mL of solution. 2. Percent weight in weight (w/w) solution, i.e. ‘w’ g (weight) of solute in ‘w’ g (weight) of solution, e.g. 1% w/w solution is 1 g of solute in 100 g of solution. 3. Percent volume in volume (v/v) solution, i.e. ‘v’ mL (volume) of solute in ‘v’ mL of solution, e.g. 1% v/v solution is 1 mL of solute in 100 mL of solution.Commonly, solutions are expressed as w/v percent, for example, 1. 0.9% normal saline (0.9% w/v solution of sodium chloride in water)—0.9 g of sodium chloride in 100 mL of solution. 2. 5% dextrose (5% w/v solution)—5 g of dextrose in 100 mL of solution. 3. 50% dextrose (50% w/v solution)—50 g of dextrose in 100 mL of solution. 4. 20% mannitol (20% w/v solution)—20 g of mannitol in 100 mL of solution.Solution can be expressed as v/v percent, e.g. 70% alcohol (70% v/v solution of alcohol)—70 mL of absolute alcohol in 100 mL of its aqueous solution.Ratio solutions: w/v solutions can also be expressed in ratios, for example, 1. 1:100 is 1 g of solute in 100 mL of solution. 2. 1:1000 is 1 g of solute in 1000 mL of solution, e.g. adrenaline 1:1000 solution means 1 g of adrenaline is present in 1000 mL of its solution.Intravenous ﬂuids (i.v. ﬂuids): The commonly used i.v. solutions are mentioned below:Intravenous ﬂuidAbbreviationNormal salineNSHalf-strength saline0.45%5% Dextrose5% D10% Dextrose10% D50% Dextrose50% DDextrose normal salineDNSRinger lactateRL

502PHARMACOLOGY FOR MEDICAL GRADUATESIntravenous ﬂuid rate should be calculated as drops/min or mL/h. Drop factor is the number of drops required to deliver 1 mL(gtt./mL) and is used in calculating the num-ber of drops per minute. The drop factor is mentioned on the infusion set. A macrodrip set usually delivers 10, 15, 16 or 20 drops/mL. A microdrip set delivers 60 drops/mL.Drip rate of a solution is the number of drops per minute (drops/min, gtt/min). Flow rate of a solution is the number of millilitre per minute or per hour. In microdrip set, the drip rate is the same as ﬂow rate (e.g. if ﬂow rate is 150 mL/h, then drip rate is 150 drops/min).Drip rate, i.e. drops/min (gtt /min)Total/H11005volume (mL) Drop factor (gtt/mL)Time (m/H11003ii n )CALCULATION OF DOSAGE OF PARENTERALLY ADMINISTERED DRUGSProblem 1: Infuse 1000 mL dextrose normal saline over 5 h.
