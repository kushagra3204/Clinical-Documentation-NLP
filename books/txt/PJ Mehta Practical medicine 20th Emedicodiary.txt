History taking is an art, which a doctor learns 
over the years by repeated practice and ex­
perience. History is the record of medical 
events that have already taken place in the patient. 
Since every disease has a pattern of behavior, a good 
history combined with a sound knowledge of medicine 
would help the doctor to judge the likely cause(s) that 
may be responsible for the patient's problems. In over 
80% cases the most likely diagnosis can be reached 
by a proper history. On clinical examination, the 
clinical state of the patient is determined at that given 
time. However, nothing is usually known of the past 
problems. Hence, without an appropriate history, an 
incorrect interpretation of the physical findings may 
be made. E.g. a person has brisk reflexes and extensor 
plantar: a recent history of transient ischemic attack 
would suggest recent stroke, whereas an old history 
of stroke a few years ago would suggest residual effect 
of a past stroke. 
A good history must record the following information 
in a systematic order. 
1.Biodataofthe patient: This should include name,
age, sex, address, occupation, religion and marital
status of the person.
2.Complaintsofthepresentillness: The complaints
with which the patient has come should be
recorded in chronological order and the duration
should be noted.
3.Origin, duration and progress: Details of each
symptom must be recorded separately. The mode
of onset, whether sudden or gradual, the duration
of each symptom and its progress and finally the
present status of the symptom must be noted.
Associated symptoms must also be inquired into
and recorded.
4.History of past illness: Similar illness in the pastwith their time ofoccurrence, duration and results 
should be noted. Childhood illnesses (eruptive 
fevers, pertussis, influenza), tuberculosis, 
diabetes, hypertesnion, asthma, heart disease, 
jaundice, joint swelling, etc. must be inquired into. 
Past injuries, accidents, operations or hospital 
stay and blood transfusion history must also be 
noted in details. 
5.Personal history: Patient's appetite, food habits,
type of diet, bowel and micturition habits, sleep
and addictions like alcohol, smoking, tobacco
chewing, charas, ganja, marijuana etc., must
be inquired into. Loss of appetite and weight
may suggest an active disease process. Similarly
improper sleep due to other symptoms would
suggest that those symptoms require urgent
attention. Alcohol, tobacco, smoking and other
intoxicants can adversely affect many systems
in the body and the role of these substances in
the patient's problems can be easily judged by
the history. E.g. alcohol may be responsible for
liver cell failure and cirrhosis as well as acute
gastritis. Heavy smoking may be responsible
for precipitating coronary artery disease or
hypertension in the young.
6.Family history: Any illness in the family must
be recorded. The state of health of parents, peers
and children should be noted. If any member is
deceased, the cause of death should be noted.
Some genetically transmitted diseases are:
a.X-linked recessive diseases (e.g. Duchenne
muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, G6PD
deficiency, ichthyosis). Women are carriers
and do not suffer from the disease, whereas
males suffer from the disease. Hence, in such
illnesses, the family history would suggest
similar illnesses in the patient's brothers,

2 sister's sons, mother's brother and mother's 
sister's sons. 
b.Autosomal dominant disorders ( e.g.
familial hyperlipidemias, polycystic kidney,
Huntington's disease, neurofibromatosis,
congenital spherocytosis, myotonia
dystrophica). There will be a family history
of similar illness in either of the parents and/
or grandparents.
c.Autosomal 
recessive disorders (e.g. beta
thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, spinal
muscular dystrophy, phenylketonuria, cystic
fibrosis, congenital 
adrenal hyperplasia).
There is usually no history of similar illness
in the parents since they may be heterozygous
and hence only carriers. However, history
of consanguineous marriage in the parents
(marriage between cousins or brother and
sister or uncle and niece) may be present and
may be responsible for the homozygous state
in the patient and thus the manifestation of
the disease.
7.Menstrual and obstetric history: In females,
the date of onset of menstruation, date of last
menstruation and the amount of blood flow,
regularity and pain during menstruation should
be noted. In a woman who has conceived, details
of past abortions, premature births and normal
or abnormal deliveries should be noted.

symptoms which the patients 
present with and their causes are given below:

1 > Built 
Built is the skeletal structure in relation to age and 
sex of the individual as compared to a normal person. 
Tall Stature 
A child is considered to be tall when the height is 
greater than 2 standard deviations above the mean 
for the age. Gigantism is the term applied when the 
patient's height is greatly in excess of the 
normal for 
his age before fusion of epiphysis. There is no fixed 
height to constitute a giant, but in adults, it is applied 
for individuals with a height of more than 6� ft. 
Causes 
1.Simple or primary gigantism: Racial, familial or
constitutional
2.Endocrine: Hyperpituitarism, hypogonadism
3.Genetic: Klinefelter's syndrome4.Metabolic: Marfan's syndrome, homocystinuria
5.Miscellaneous: Cerebral gigantism, etc.
Differential Diagnosis 
1.Constitutional: Usually in constitutional tall
stature the parents are also tall. In all children
whose parents or grand parents are also tall, a
suspicion of a pathological disorder must be
raised. The child is otherwise normal. In boys
usually no treatment is required. In girls long
term estrogen could be used to suppress further
growth. However, because of its side-effects,
usually it is avoided unless the predicted adult
height is more than 183 ems.
2.Gigantism (Acromegaly!Hyperpituitarism): In
gigantism the 
patient is very tall but with normal
body proportions. However, the features are
coarse with increased heel pad thickness. There
may be evidence of raised intracranial tension
and bitemporal hemianopia. Pituitary tumors
need surgery.
3.CerebralGigantism(Soto'ssyndrome): Children
with cerebral gigantism have a large elongated
head, prominent forehead, large ears and jaws,
elongated chin, antimongoloid slant to the eyes
and coarse facial features. They have subnormal
intelligence and impaired coordination. The cause
is not known.
4.Sexual Precocity and virilizing disorders: In
these children, acceleration of linear growth
occurs simultaneously with signs of premature
sexual development or inappropriate virilization.
This disorder may be due to congenital adrenal
hyperplasia, adrenal tumor, gonadal tumor or
premature secretion of gonadotropic hormones.
The bone age is usually advanced so that the adult
stature may be diminished.

fingers ( arachnodactyly), hyperextensible joints,
dislocation of the lens, high arched palate,
kyphoscoliosis, arm span greater than the height
and the lower segmetnt more than the upper

Short Stature (Dwarfism) 
Dwarfism is the term applied when the patient's 
height is 2standard deviations less than that for 
his/her age and sex. Mid-parental height usually de­
termines the final height. 
Causes 
1.Hereditary/ Genetic
2.Chromosomal: Turner's syndrome (45XO),
Down's syndrome, Noonan's syndrome, etc.
3.Constitutional growth delay
4.Delayed puberty
5.Nutritional: Malnutrition, malabsorption, rickets
6.Endocrine: Growth hormone deficiency,
hypopituitarism, hypothyroidism, excessive
androgens, Cushings syndrome, congenital
adrenal hyperplasia
7.Skeletal: Achondroplasia, spinal deformities,
skeletal dysplasias
8.Systemic diseases: Renal tubular acidosis, uremia,
11 

12 congenital cyanotic heart disease, cirrhosis of 
liver, etc. 
Differential Diagnosis 
1.Hereditary: In hereditary short stature there is
no endocrine abnormality. The bone age and the
dental age are normal. Although they are short,
they grow at a constant rate of 4-5 ems a year and
they have normal body proportions for age. This
may be either genetic (if there is a family history of
short stature) or primordial (if there is no family
history of short stature). The latter may be due to
intrauterine growth failure or postnatal growth
retardation. These children require no endocrine
treatment.
2.Constitutional growth delay and delayed puberty:
This disorder is common among adolescent boys.
There is no true endocrine deficiency. They grow
at a constant rate of about 4 cm a year but their
bone age and dental age is delayed by about 2
years. Often there is a history of delay in growth
and pubertal development in the father and other
male relatives.
If puberty does not occur spontaneously by 15 years
of age, it can be induced by testosterone enanthate
250 mg IM once a month for 3 months.
3.Turner's syndrome (SHOX gene deficiency):
These children are girls who have agenesis of
their ovaries. The chromosomal pattern is 45XO.
They have a characteristically short webbed neck,PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
low hairline, square and shield-like chest, cubitus 
valgus and mental retardation. Although short, 
they grow at the rate ofless than 4 cm each year 
with normal bone age and dental age but absent 
pubertal growth spurt, so that during adolescence, 
the skeletal age is delayed due to the absence of 
sex hormones (streak ovaries). 
Giving them oxandrolone 0.15 mg/kg/day with 
growth hormone from early adolescence till 
puberty can increase the height. After the age of 
15 years cyclical estrogen replacement therapy 
in physiological doses is given for life. Growth 
hormone replacement is recommended before 
epiphyseal fusion. 
4.Hypopituitarism (including Growth Hormone
deficiency): These children have the skeletal age
and the dental age delayed by more than 2 years.
The growth rate is less than 4 cm/year. The ratio
of the upper segment and the lower segment is
normal. They have genetic defects (prop-I, pit­
I gene deficiency). MRI shows hypoplastic or
aplastic pitutaries. Growth hormone replacement
is necessary.
5.Hypothyroidism: These children have mental,
dental and skeletal retardation since birth. There
would be coarse dry skin and constipation. Their
body proportion is infantile i.e. upper segment
is more than lower segment. Lifelong thyroxine
replacement is required.
6.Achondroplasia: Achondroplastic dwarfs have
short limbs resulting in short stature. Hence,

the lower segment is always less than the upper 
segment. Their mental and dental ages are normal 
and so are the endocrine functions. 
7.Systemic diseases: Most chronic systemic diseases
can cause growth failure during childhood. These
illnesses can be recognized by their own specific
clinical features and growth failure is a secondary
problem.
ortions 
Normally, in adults, the height of the person is equal 
to the length of arm span. The upper segment (from 
vertex to the pubic symphysis) is equal to the lower 
segment (from pubic symphysis to the heel). 
In infants, the upper segment is greater than the lower 
segment and the height is greater than the arm span. 
This infantile type of body proportion persists in 
achondroplasia, cretinism and juvenile myxedema. 
The reverse of infantile body proportion i.e. arm span 
greater than height and lower segment greater than 
upper segment occurs in eunuchoidism, Marfan's 
syndrome, homocystinuria, Klinefelter's syndrome 
and Frohlich's syndrome. With iron therapy

3 > Nutrition 
A normal person is well nourished as regards proteins, 
fats, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals. Certain 
clinical signs help to diagnose deficiency of one or 
more of these nutrients. 
1. Proteins: Hypoproteinemia causes rough skin
and later edema of feet and brittle hair.
2.Fats: Fat malnutrition leads to cachexia with
hollowing of cheeks, loss of the shape of hips ( due
to loss of fats), flat abdomen and absent fat over
the subcutaneous tissues of the elbows.
3.Carbohydrates: Carbohydrate malnutrition
is difficult to detect clinically because there is
gluconeogenesis from fats or proteins.
4.Vitamins: These can be fat soluble (Vitamins A,
D, E, K) or water soluble (rest) and are discussed
in the tables.
5.Minerals: Deficiency of two minerals can be
diagnosed clinically. Iron deficiency causes
koilonychia and pallor whereas calcium deficiency
causes tetany.

< 2 > General Examination 
4 > Decubi�_u_s ___ _ 
Decubitus or the posture a patient adopts when lying 
in bed often gives a valuable diagnostic clue. 
1.Hemiplegia: The patient lies in bed with one side
immobile, the affected arm flexed and the affected
leg externally rotated and extended.
2.Meningitis and tetanus: The patient has neck
stiffness and opisthotonos.
3.Colic: In renal, biliary or intestinal colic, the
patient is markedly restless and tossing and
turning in bed in agony.
4.Acute 
inflammatory abdominal disease: The
patient lies on his back quietly with legs drawn
up.
5.Cardiorespiratory embarrassment: The patient
is more comfortable in sitting-up position. This
position is also 
assumed in abdominal distention
and ascites when intra-abdominal pressure is
raised.
6.Pneumonia and pleurisy: The patient is most
comfortable lying on the affected side because
the movement on the affected side is restricted.
5 > Clubbing 
Definition 
Clubbing is bulbous enlargement of soft parts of the 
terminal phalanges with both transverse and longitu­
dinal curving of the nails. The swelling of the terminal 
phalanges occurs due to interstitial edema and dilation 
of the arterioles and capillaries. 
Causes

Grades 
I.Softening of nail bed
II.Obliteration of the angle of the nail bed
Ill. Swelling of the subcutaneous tissues over the base
of the nail causing the overlying skin to become 
tense, shiny and wet and increasing the curvature 
of the nail, resulting in parrot beak or drumstick 
appearance (Figs. 2.1 & 2.2). 
IV.Swelling of the fingers in all dimensions associated
with hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy
causing pain and swelling of the hand, wrist etc.
and radiographic evidence of subperiosteal new
bone formation ( commonly seen in bronchogenic
carcinoma, paraneoplastic syndromes).
Schamroth's Sign (Fig. 2.3) 
Normally when two fingers are held together with 
nails facing each other, a diamond-shaped space is 
seen at the level of proximal nail fold. This is lost in 
case of clubbing

Mechanism 
1.The exact mechanism is not known. It is believed
that the stimulus for clubbing is hypoxia. Hypoxia
leads to opening of deep arteriovenous fistulas,
which increase the blood supply of the fingers
and toes causing it to hypertrophy.
2.Another hypothesis is that when reduced ferritin
in venous blood escapes oxidation in the lungs andPRACTICAL MEDICINE 
enters the systemic circulation, it causes dilation 
of arteriovenous anastomosis and hypertrophy of 
the terminal phalanx resulting in clubbing. 
3.Platelet-derived growth factor causing
vasodilatation.
Pseudoclubbing 
In hyperparathyroidism or leprosy excessive bone 
resorption may result in disappearance of the ter­
minal phalanges with telescoping of soft tissues and 
a 'drumstick' appearance of the fingers resembling 
clubbing. However, the curvature of the nail is not 
present.

{ 2 ) General Examination 
Mechanism 
In an adult, on an average, there is 15 gm% of hemo­
globin, 95% of which is saturated with oxygen and 
only 5% i.e. 0.75 gm% is reduced. Hence, in capillar­
ies, a mean of the two i.e. only 2-3 gm% is reduced 
hemoglobin and the color of the skin and mucous 
membranes is pink. 
When the amount is reduced hemoglobin exceeds 5 
gm% in the capillaries, the blood appears dark, giv­
ing the tissues a bluish hue. This is seen earliest in the 
warm areas with increased capillary circulation e.g. 
palate, tongue, inner sides of the lips and conjunctiva. 
Peripheral cyanosis occurs due to slowing of blood, 
which allows more time for removal of oxygen by the 
tissues, so that cyanosis is visible on the tip of nose, 
ear lobule, tip of finger, nailbed and cheek. In mixed 
cyanosis there is both arterial hypoxemia and sluggish 
circulation. 
Causes 
I.Central:
A. Cardiac
1.Congenital, cyanotic heart disease: Fallot's
tetrad, Eisenmenger's complex etc. 
2.Congestive cardiac failure.
B.Pulmonar y
1. 
2. Chronic obstructive lung disease. 
Collapse and fibrosis oflung. 
3.Marked pulmonary destruction due to
any cause.
4.Pulmonary AV fistula.
C.Abdominal hepato-pulmonary syndrome.
D.High altitude due to low partial pressure of
oxygen.
II.Peripheral:
A.Cold (local vasoconstriction)
B.Increased viscosity of blood
C.Shock
D.Reynaud's phenomenon
III.Mixed
A.Acute left ventricular failure
B.Mitral stenos is (left atrial failure and peripheral
vasoconstriction).IV.Cyanosis due to abnormal pigments:
Normal hemoglobin has iron in ferrous form. In
methemoglobinemia, iron is in the ferric form
designated as MHb. Several substances like nitrite
ingestion (well water), sulfonamide or aniline
dyes oxidize Hb to MHb, but this is immediately
reduced back to Hb by methemoglobin reductase
I or diaphorase I. If there is deficiency of diaphorase
I, MHb circulates in blood, causing cyanosis.
Colour ofbloodis chocolate brown. The MHb levels
should be> 1.5 g/dl to cause cyanosis.
Sulfhemo globin (SHb) is an abnormal sulphur
containing substance, which is not normally
present but is formed by toxic action of drugs
and chemicals like sulphonamides, phenacetin,
and acetanilide. SHb forms an irreversible change
in the Hb pigment that has no capacity to carry
oxygen and causes cyanosis. SHb levels should
be >0.5 g/dl to cause cyanosis.
Differential Cyanosis 
I.Only oflower limbs -Patent ductus arteriosus
(PDA) with reversal of shunt.
II.Only of upper limbs -PDA with reversal of
shunt in a transposition of great vessels.
III.Cyanosis of left upper limb and both lower
limbs -PDA with reversal of shunt and pre­
ductal coarctation of aorta.
Conditions where Cyanosis does not 
Occur 
1.In severe anemia where hemoglobin is less than
5 gm%, even if all the hemoglobin is reduced in
the capillaries, it will be less than the critical level
of 5 gm% and cyanosis does not occur.
2.In carbon monoxide poisoning, carboxy­
hemoglobin prevents reduction of oxyhemoglobin
and the former has a cherry red color. Hence there
is no cyanosis.
7 > Jaundice 
Definition 
Jaundice is a symptom complex which is characterized 
19 

20 by yellow coloration of tissues and body fluids due 
to an increase i.n bile pigments. It may arise due to: 
1.Increased bile pigment load to the liver.
2.Affection ofbilirubin diffusion into the liver cells.
3.Defective conjugation.
4.Defective excretion.
Other Causes of Yellow Coloration of 
Tissues 
Yellow coloration of tissues can occur due to caroten­
emia and mepacrine therapy. 
Normal Values 
Serum bilirubin: Total: 1 mg%, Direct: 0.25 mg%. 
Urinary bilirubin is present if direct bilirubin is greater 
than 0.4 mg% in serum. 
Urine urobilinogen: 100-200 mg/day. 
Fecal stercobilinogen: 300 mg/ day 
Table 2.6 : Differential Diagnosis of Jaundice PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
Distribution of Jaundice 
Since bilirubin binds with circulating pro­
teins, it is more evident if proteins are increased 
e.g. exudates. Again, bilirubin has more affin­
ity for nervous tissue e.g. basal ganglia and elastic
tissues e.g. skin, sclera and blood vessels.

Bilirubin Metabolism 
1.Breakdown phase: Hemoglobin released
by breakdown of aged cells is broken
down into globin and heme in the
spleen. The heme is further broken into
iron and bilirubin. Bilirubin attaches to
serum albumin and is transported to 
the liver where it is taken up. Bilirubin
( unconjugated) bound to albumin cannot
be excreted by kidneys.
2.Conjugation phase: In the liver, bilirubin
is separated from albumin and conjugated
to glucuronide by glucuronyl transferase.
The conjugated bilirubin is water-soluble
and can be excreted by kidneys.
3.Alimentary phase: The conjugated
bilirubin is excreted through the
bile canaliculi and reaches the intestines
where it is converted to stercobilinogen
and urobilinogen by the intestinal
bacteria. About 70% of this is absorbed in
the colon and brought back to the liver and 
re-excreted (enterohepatic circulation).
Unabsorbed sterco-bilinogen gives
brown color to the feces.
4.Excretion phase: Circulating
urobilinogen is carried to the kidneys
for excretion in the urine as urobilinogen.s

Lymphadenopathy is inflammatory or non-inflam­
matory enlargement of lymph nodes. 
Examination 
The lymph nodes of the neck should be examined by
standing behind the patient with the patient's neck 
slightly flexed. The nodes must be examined from 
above downward -submental, submandibular, tonsil­
lar, cervical, posterior auricular & occipital groups. 
In the left supra-clavicular fossa, a lymph node may 
be palpable (Virchow's nod�) which occurs due to
metastasis from stomach or testicular malignancy. 
The axillary glands should be examined by inserting 
the fingers in the axilla with the patient's arm slightly 
abducted. The arm is then abducted and the apical, 
anterior, posterior, medial and lateral groups oflymph 
nodes are examined. The supratrochlear lymph nodes are palpated on the 
medial aspect of the arm between the groove ofbiceps 
and brachialis muscle, an inch above the arm fold. 
The inguinal nodes are examined in the supine position 
with the thigh extended. 
Both the medial and lateral 
groups oflymph nodes are examined. 
Scalene nodes are present behind the sternomastoid
muscle and may be palpable. In suspected malignancy , 
biopsy it taken from that area, even if the nodes are 
not palpable. 
Inspection: Most of the superficial lymph nodes are 
visible when enlarged. The site of lymphadenopathy 
often gives the clue to its cause. Tuberculosis often af­
fects the upper deep cervical nodes, secondary syphilis 
affects supratrochlear nodes, carcinoma of stomach 
affects the left supraclavicular nodes whereas filariasis 
affects the inguinal nodes. 
The skin overlying the lymph nodes may show redness 
indicating underlying inflammation. Ulceration or 
sinus may be 
present in tuberculosis. 
Palpation: Raised temperature and tenderness is noted. 
If present, suggests acute inflammation. The surface 
is smooth normally but matted in tuberculosis and 
irregular in malignancy and inflammation. 
The consistency of the nodes is noted. Normally it 
is firm. It is rubbery in Hodgkin's disease, firm and 
shotty in syphilis, matted in tuberculosis and hard in 
malignancy. The mobility of the nodes is noted. Nor­
mally they are mobile and free from skin. In certain 
inflammatory conditions and malignancy they may 
be fixed and non-mobile.

Tuberculous Lymphadenitis 
1.Commonly affects the deep cervical, mesenteric
and axillary glands.
2.The lymph nodes may be discrete (when it
resembles chronic 
septic lymphadenitis) or may
be matted due to periadenitis. If caseation has
occurred, cold 
abscess results which may burst

and movable with little tendency towards matting,
softening or suppuration.
4.Pressure symptoms: Edema, venous engorge­
ment and cyanosis of head and neck may occur
due to pressure on the superior vena cava and the
bronchus by the mediastinal glands. Root pains
and paraplegia may develop due to pressure on
the spinal cord.
5.Hepatosplenomegaly and anemia occur.
6.Pel Ebstein's type of fever (recurrent bouts of

10 > Edema 
Edema is the collection of fluid in the interstitial spaces 
or serous cavities. It becomes evident only when 5-6 
liters of fluid has accumulated in the water depots. 
Pitting on pressure occurs when the circumference 
of the limb is increased by l 0%. 
Mechanism 
One or more of the following factors may be respon­
sible. 
1.Increased capillary permeability when it is
damaged e.g. acute inflammation.
2.Increased capillary pressure e.g. cardiac failure.
3.Decreased osmotic pressure of the blood e.g.
hypoproteinemia.
4.Damaged lymphatic drainage e.g. filariasis.
4.Diagnosis confirmed by histological examinationSite of the bone marrow.
Venous edema commonly occurs in the lower limbs 
25 

which are most dependent. However, if the patient 
is recumbent,. edema may be present only over 
the sacral region which is, then, most dependent. 
Lymphatic edema may occur in either limbs or over 
scrotum depending upon the site of involvement. 
Causes 
26 Bilateral: 
A.Cardiac: CCF, LVF, pericarditis
B.Renal: Acute nephritis, nephrotic syndrome
C.Hepatic: Cirrhosis ofliver, portal hypertension
D.Venous: Inferior vena cava obstruction
E.Endocrine: Myxedema
F.Allergic: Angioneurotic edema
G.Nutritional: Anemia, hypoproteinemia,
beriberi.
H.Toxic: Epidemic dropsy
Unilateral: 
A.Lymphatic:
1.Filariasis
2.Pressure by new growth, metastasis
3.Radiation
B.Traumatic: Bruises, sprains, fractures
C.Infections: 
Cellulitis, boils, carbuncle
D.Metabolic: Gout
E.Venous: Venous thrombosis, varicose veins.
F.Hereditary: Milroy's diseasePRACTICAL MEDICINE 
Differential Diagnosis 
1.Cardiac
A.Congestive Cardiac Failure: The edema is
found on the most dependent 
parts of the body
as gravity plays an important part. Hence, in an
ambulatory patient edema is in the feet, ankles
and legs whereas in the recumbent patient it
is mainly over the sacrum, lumbar region and
genitalia. It is most marked in the evening.
B.Left ventricular failure: Accumulation offluid
in the lung occurs much earlier than 
edema of
the feet, resulting in dyspnea, cough and basal
rates.
C.Pericardial effusion: Since there is obstruction
to the flow of blood into the right atrium,
edema of feet may occur, but no edema of
lungs occurs because the heart is able to pump
the little blood it receives into 
the lungs and
general circulation. It is associated with raised
JVP, hepatomegaly and ascites.

( 2 ) Ge11eral Examination 
2.Kidney
A.Acute nephritis: Edema is generalized and
not restricted to the dependent parts of
the body. It is more noticeable in the early
morning. The fluid accumulates initially in
the loose connective tissues, hence it is most
marked around the eyelids and face. The
cause of edema is damage to the endothelial
lining of the capillaries, disturbance of fluid
and sodium excretion and later also due to
hypoproteinemia.
B.Nephrotic sydrome: Swelling is generalized
and massive due to hypoproteinemia following
massive albuminuria.
3.Hepatic (Portal hypertension): Here ascites
occurs before edema of feet. This occurs due to
hypoproteinemia and compression of the hepatic
branches of the portal vein. Ascites leads to
pressure on the venous circulation in the lower
limbs leading to edema of the legs.
4.Venous (Inferior vena cava obstruction): This is
characterized by bilateral nondependent painless
pitting edema. Collateral dilated veins are usually
present in the flanks with flow of blood from
below upwards.
5.Endocrine (Myxedema): Here edema is non-pitting, associated with puffy face, weight gain, 
weakness, alopecia, hoarse voice, rough dry skin, 
constipation, anemia and menstrual disturbances. 
6.Allergic (Angioneurotic edema): This often
resembles myxedema with swelling over the face
and limbs. There is usually intense itching and
bronchospasm.
7.Nutritional: This is characterized by dependent
edema with puffiness of face, pallor and cachexia.
8.Filariasis: In filariasis, edema occurs due to
destruction of the lymphatic filter action of the
lymph glands with consequent blocking and
dilation of the lymph vessels. Subsequently there
is transudation of lymph, rich in proteins, into
the tissues. Later connective tissues proliferate
leading to elephantiasis. This is characterized
by unilateral non-pitting edemawith rough skin.
There may be history off ever with rigors especially
at night and initially pitting edema. Blood smear
may show microfilaria.
9.Gout: This commonly affects the big toe with
marked pain, edema and deformity of the part
involved. Tophi may be present. There may be
history of renal colic or renal stones.
10.Venous Thrombosis: This is characterized by
unilateral painful pitting edema.

12 Vertebral Column 
The vertebral column in a normal upright position 
has two antero-posterior curves -one with a concavity 
forwards in the upper dorsal region and the other with 
a slight convexity forwards in the dorsolumbar region. 
Normally, there is no lateral curvature. The vertebral 
column should be examined for any abnormality, 
angular deformity, swelling or tenderness. 
Normally the vertebral column has both anterior as 
well as lateral mobility. This can be tested by asking 
the patient to bend forwards, backwards and sideways. 
Limitation of movements and pain, if any, should be 
looked for.

�>Temperature __ 
The body temperature refers to the temperature of 
the viscera and tissues of the body. It is kept within 
the normal level by maintaining a balance between 
the heat gain and heat loss, which is regulated by the 
hypothalamus. 
The body temperature is best recorded with a mercury 
thermometer, which should be kept in position for 
about a minute. Usually temperature is recorded in 
the axilla. However, if there is a lot of perspiration, 
oral temperature should be taken. In cholera, rectal 
temperature is recorded which may be high, whereas 
the skin temperature may be subnormal. 
The normal body temperature varies from 36°C
-37.5°C. There is normally a diurnal variation of 1•c,
the lowest temperature being between 2-4 am and
highest in the afternoon.
Fever or pyrexia is an increase of more than 1 °C or any 
rise above the maximal normal temperature. The follow­
ing terms are used when recording the body temperature: 
1. Hypothermia 
2. Subnormal
3. Normal
4. Mild fever
5. Moderate fever 
6. High fever 
7. Hyperpyrexia

common in practice.
3.Intermittent fever: The temperature is present
only for some hours in a day and remits to normal
for the remaining hours. When the spike occurs
daily, it is quotidian, when every alternate day, it
is tertian and when every third day, it is quartan.
Intermitten t fever is seen in malaria, kala-azar,
pyemia, septicemia etc.
4.Hectic or septic: The temperature variation
between peak and nadir is very large and exceeds
s·c e.g. septicemia.
5.Pel Ebstein type: There is a regular alternation
of recurrent bouts of fever and afebrile periods.
The temperature may take 3 days to rise, remains
high for 3 days and remits in 3 days, followed by 
apyrexia for 9 days seen in Hodgkin's lymphoma.
6.Low grade fever: Temperature is present daily
especially in the evening for several days but does
not exceed 37.8°Cat anytime. Usually it does not
indicate disease, but it is commonly present with
tuberculosis.
Causes of Fever 
l.Infections: Bacterial, viral, rickettsial, fungal
parasitic, etc.

Benefits of Fever 
In some human diseases, fever is beneficial, e.g. wide· 
spread cancer, neurosyphilis, chronic arthritis, etc. 
Fever was often induced in these diseases by injection 
of milk protein or BCG vaccine. 
It has been suggested that fever is associated with release 
of endogenous pyrogens, which activate the T cells and 
thus enhance the host defense mechanism. 
Harmful Effects 
l.Hypercatabolism-nitrogen wastage and weight
loss.
2.Fluid and electrolyte imbalance · due to sweating.
3.Convulsions and brain damage
4.Circulatory overload, arrhythmias, etc. 
Hypothermia 
Hypothermia is decreased body temperature. 
Causes 
l.Endocrine: Hypothyroidism or myxedema,
hypopituitarism (Simmonds cachexia),
hypoglycemia
2.Toxic: Alcoholic intoxication, barbiturate
poisoning, ketoacidosis
3.Exposure to cold
4.Autonomic dysfunction or dysautonomias
16 > Pulse 
Definition : Pulse is a wave which is felt by the finger, 
produced by cardiac systole travelling in the peripheral 
direction in the arterial tree at a rate faster than the 
column of blood. 
A normal pulse wave is transmitted peripherally tak­
ing 30 msec to reach the carotids, 60 msec to reach 
the brachial artery, 80 msec to reach the radial artery 
and 75 msec to reach the femoral artery. 
The normal pulse has a small anacrotic wave on the 
upstroke, which is not felt. This is followed by a big tidal or percussion wave which is felt.by the palpating 
finger. On the following downstroke there is a notch 
(dicrotic notch) followed by a wave (dicrotic wave) 
both of which are not normally palpable. 
Pulse is assessed by:

6.Radio-radial delay (pre-ductal coarctation
of aorta), radio-femoral delay (post ductal
coarctation of aorta) (Refer Pg. 255)
7.Apex pulse deficit ( atrial fibrillation)
The normal pulse appears at regular intervals and 
has a rate between 60-100 per min. There may be a 
mild variation in the rate between the two phases of 
respiration which is called sinus arrhythmia.

I.Anacrotic Pulse: is a slow rising, twice beating

II.Pulsus Bisferiens is a rapid rising, twice beating
pulse where both the waves are felt during systole.
Here the percussion wave is felt first followed by
a small wave. It is seen in:
A.Idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis: Here
initially there is no obstruction to the outflow

III. s D s D 
F,g. 2.25 · Pulsus B1sfer1ens (rap1d-rrs1ng) 
and about 80%of the stroke volume is ejected in 
the early part of systole. The obstruction occurs 
in mid systole when aortic valve approximates 
the hypertrophied septum. Hence, there is a 
dip, as suddenly the flow ceases, followed by 
a secondary rise as the L. V. overcomes the 
obstruction. 
B.Severe A.I. with mild A.S.: The volume flow is
initially increased due to severe A.I. Mild A.S.
causes an extra high velocity jet to be shot out
resulting in the second wave.
Dicrotic Pulse is a twice-beating pulse where the 
first percussion wave is felt during systole and the 
second dicrotic wave is felt during diastole. It is 
seen when the peripheral resistance and diastolic 
pressures are low as in:

Aortic Stenosis. It is best felt in the carotids.F,g 2 27 Pulsus parvuset tardus 
V.Puls us Al tern ans is characterized by a strong and
weak beat occurring alternately, probably due to
alternate rather than regular contraction of the
muscle fibers of the left ventricle.
Causes 
A.Left ventricular failure
B.Toxic myocarditis
C.Paroxysmal tachycardias
D.For several beats following a premature beat
VI. F,g 2 28 Pulsusalternans 
Pulsus Paradoxus: Normally systolic blood 
pressure falls by 3-10 mm. during inspiration. 
This is because though there is increased venous 
return to the right side of the heart there is relative 
pooling of the blood in the pulmonary vasculature 
as a result of lung expansion and more negative 
intrathoracic pressure during inspiration. This 
decreases the venous return to the left atrium 
and ventricle and subsequently causes a fall in 
left ventricular output decreasing the arterial 
pressure. When the systolic blood pressure falls 
more than 1 O mm. Hg. during inspiration the pulse 
is erroneously called pulsus paradoxus although 
it merely is an exaggeration and not a reversal of 
the normal. 
The paradox of this phenomenon is that in 
extreme cases the peripheral pulse can disappear 
on inspiration while, paradoxically, heart sounds 
remain audible during the "missed beats". 
A reverse pulsus paradoxus may occur in 
patients receiving continuous airway pressure 
on a mechanical ventilator.

NB: If the thoracic cage is immobile as in 
ankylosing spondylitis, pulsus paradoxus does 
not occur. 
VII. Puls us Bigeminus ( Coupling) is coupling of the
pulse waves in pairs, followed by a pause.
Causes
A.Alternate premature beats.
B. A.V. block, every third sinus impulse being

C.Sinoatrial block with ventricular escape.

VIII. Thready Pulse: The pulse rate is rapid and the
pulse wave is small and disappears quickly. This
is seen in shock especially cardiogenic.
IX.Waterhammer Pulse is a large bounding pulse
associated with increased stroke volume of the
left ventricle and decrease in the peripheral
resistance, leading to a wide pulse pressure. The
pulse strikes the palpating finger with a rapid,
forceful jerk and quickly disappears. It is best
felt in the radial artery with the patient's arm
elevated. It is caused by the artery suddenly
emptying because some of the blood flows back
from the aorta into the ventricle.PRACTICAL MEDICINE

( 2 ) General Examination 
Usually palpation of Carotid Pulse gives better infor­
mation about the character of pulse than peripheral 
arteries like the Radial artery. However Pulses Alter 
nans, Bisferiens and water hammer pulse are better 
felt at the peripheral arteries. 
Apex Pulse Deficit 
It is the difference between the heart rate and pulse rate, 
counted simultaneously, by two people, for 1 minute. 
When only one person is examining, the radial artery 
is palpated simultaneously while ausculating the apex. 
The heart beats which are not transmitted to the radial 
pulse are counted as the Apex Pulse Deficit.

44 at 45°. In this position, normally, the internal jugular
vein is just seen above the clavicles. The upper level of 
the vein is noted and a ruler is kept at that 
level, parallel 
to the ground. Another rule is put perpendicular to the 
first ruler up to the angle of Louis. The distance from 
the angle of Louis to the first ruler gives the jugular 
pressure. In the supine position the jugular pressure 
may falsely appear elevated whilst in the upright posi­
tion it is falsely lowered. 
Significance: The jugular veins are in direct continuity 
with the superior vena cava and the right atrium. Hence 
it reflects pressure changes in the right atrium. 
NORMAL JVP: The normal JVP consists of three 
positive pulse waves (a, c and v) and two negative 
pulse waves (x and y). 
THE 'K. WAVE is produced by retrograde transmis­
sion of the pressure pulse produced by right atrial 
contraction. In normal subjects the 'a' wave is often 
the largest positive wave visible, coinciding with the 
fourth heart sound.

It normally begins at the 
end of the first heart sound

The 'c' wave is not often seen clinically. 
THE 'X' WAVE: 'x' descent is produced by: 
A.The downward displacement of the tricuspid
valve during ventricular systole and resultant fall
in right atrial pressure.
B.Continued atrial relaxation.
Abnormalities of 'x' wave 
A.The 'x' descent is obliterated or may be replaced
by a positive wave ('s' wave) in tricuspid
regurgitation. This 's' wave may fuse with the 'c'
and 'v' waves to produce a giant 'V' wave (Fig.
2.24).

IBE 'V' WA VE occurs because of right atrial filling with 
the tricuspid valve closed during ventricular systole. 
Abnormalities of'v' wave: Giant 'v' waves, as discussed 
earlier, appear in tricuspid regurgitation. 
THE 
'Y' WAVE: The 'y' descent is produced by open­
ing of the tricuspid valve and subsequent rapid inflow 
of blood from the right atrium to the right ventricle 
leading to a sudden fall of pressure in the right atrium 
which is reflected in the jugular veins. It corresponds 
with the third heart sound. 
The ascending limb of the 'y' wave is due to continu­
ous diastolic inflow of blood into the great veins, right 
atrium and ventricle, which are all in free communica­
tion during diastole. Abnormalities of 'y' descent:

46 Kussmaul's sign: Normally inspiration lowers the 
JV pressure giving an inspiratory collapse, because 
intrathoracic pressure falls and there is increased 
blood flow into the thorax. In contrast, when the 
intrapericardial pressure is raised as in constrictive 
pericarditis there is a paradoxical increase in JV pres­
sure on inspiration. This is Kussmaul's sign. 
Hepatojugular Reflux 
Normally, when pressure is applied over the abdomen 
(right hypochondrium) for 30 seconds, initially there is 
a rise in JV pressure (due to increased venous return), 
followed by a fall ( due to the capacity of normal myo­
cardium to accommodate the extra venous return). 
However, in early cardiac failure, even before jugular 
pressure is elevated, there is a sustained elevated pres­
sure in the jugular veins (for more than a minute) on 
pressure over the abdomen because the failing heart 
cannot compensate for the extra venous return. This 
is positive hepatojugular reflux. 
There is no rise in jugular venous pressure on apply­
ing pressure over abdomen in: 
l.Budd Chiari syndrome
2.IVC Obstruction
Decreased venous pressure in seen in:
1.Shock
2.Dehydration
18 > Blood Pressure 
Systolic BP is controlled by the stroke volume of the 
heart and the stiffness of the arterial vessels. Diastolic 
BP is controlled by the peripheral resistance. 
BP varies from moment to moment with respiration, 
emotion, exercise, meals, alcohol, tobacco, bladder 
distension, temperature and pain. It is also influenced 
by circadian rhythm, age and race. BP may be modi­
fied by obesity or arrhythmia. 
Shortly after Scopine Riva-Rocci had invented the 
sphygmomanometer, the Russian surgeon Korotkoff 
suggested that by placing a stethoscope over the 
brachia! artery at the antecubital fossa distal to the 
Riva-Rocci 
cuff, sounds could be heard. The origin 
of these sounds is still not clear. Vibratory and flow 
phenomenon are probably responsible. The phases are: PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
Phase I: The first appearance of faint clear tapping 
sounds (Thuds) which gradually increase in

Phase II: The softening of the sounds which may 
become swishing or blowing. 
Phase III: The return of sharper softer sounds, 
which become crisper, but never fully regain the

( 2 } General Examination 
Techniqu e 
1.Clothing should be removed from the arm. If it 
cannot be removed, it is better to leave it as it is,
rather than fold the clothing into tight constricting
bands.
2.The cuff should be encircled around the arm. Ifthe
bladder does not encircle the arm completely, the
centre of the bladder should be over the brach ial
artery. The rubber tubes from the bladder are
usually placed inferiorly at the site of the brachia!
artery, but it is better to place it superiorly or
posteriorly so that the antecubital fossa can be
easily auscultated.
The normal cuff is 25 cm in length and 12 cm in
width.
3.The bell gives better sound reproduction but a
diaphragm is easier to secure with the finger of
one's hand and covers a large area.
4.The bladder is inflated quickly to a pressure 20
mm Hg above the systolic pressure, recognized by
disappearance of the radial pulse. The bladder is
then deflated 2 mm Hg per second. The Korotkoff
phase I (appearance) and phase V (disappearance)
are recorded to nearest 2 mm. In children, phase IV
may be preferable. If Korotkoff sounds are weak,
the patient is asked to raise the arm and open and
close the fist 5-10 times before inflating the bladder.
1he pressure, patient position, the arm and the
cuff size should be recorded.

Fig. 2 41 Blood Pressure Measurement a large bladder ( 18 x 24 ems) for adults should be 
wrapped around the thigh of the prone patient 
and the Korotkoff sounds auscultated in the 
popliteal fossa in the usual way. Diastolic BP 
in the legs is equal to that in the arms provided 
the bladder is adequate in size. Systolic BP 
in lower limbs is 20 mm Hg more than upper limbs. 
6.For children, pediatric size cuff should be
used.
Guidelines for Measurement of BP 
1.Explain the procedure to the patient to allay
anxiety.
2.Avoid exertion, meals or smoking for 30
minutes before BP is measured. No exogenous
adrenergic stimulants (e.g. phenylephrine in
nasal decongestants) should be used. The patient
must be allowed to rest for 5 minutes before BP
is measured.
3.The room should be warm and quiet.
4.High BP may be erroneous! y recorded in an obese
person because the inflatable rubber bladder may
be too short for the obese arm (Recommended
dimensions are 12 x 35 ems). When the bladder
does not completely encircle the arm, the centre
of the bladder must be placed directly over the
brachia! artery.
5.The arm must be supported to the heart level.
In the supine position the arm is usually at the
heart level. In sitting and standing positions the
arm must be horizontal with fourth intercostal
space at the sternum. In normal people there is
no significant difference in BP between supine,
sitting and standing positions provided the
arm is supported at the heart level. Some anti­
hypertensive agents cause postural hypotension
and when this is expected, BP must be measured
in both lying and standing positions.
6.If the arm is unsupported, the patient will perform
isometric exercise, which may elevate the diastolic
BP by l 0%. This is especially so in hypertensive
patients on beta-adrenergic blocking agents. To
avoid this the arm must be supported.
7.The BP may be higher in right arm by 2-10 mm
Hg. Most pressures in practice are measured on
the right arm. However if the BP is higher by 10
47 

48 mm Hg in one arm further measurements should 
be made in the arm with the higher BP. 
8.The cuff should be snugly fitted to the arm. A cuff
which is too tight may give a false lower blood
pressure and a loose cuff may give a false higher
BP.
9.Repeated inflation of the cuff may cause venous
congestion of the limb and elevate both systolic
and diastolic BP. To avoid this the cuff should
be inflated as rapidly as possible and deflated
completely between successive readings. At least
15 seconds should be allowed between successive
measurements.
I 0. Auscultatory Gap: Is the interval ofblood pressure 
when the Korotkoff sounds 
disappear and then 
re-appear at a lower pressure during auscultatory 
method of measury B.P. This leads to errors of 
underestimation of systolic BP or overestimation 
of diastolic B.P. This can be avoided by doing the 
palpatory method first, followed by auscultatory 
method. 
Unequal BP in two arms 
I.In normal individuals, BP may vary upto 10 mm
Hg in the two arms.
2.Supravalvular aortic stenosis (right sided higher
BP)
3.Preductal coarctation of aorta {right sided higher
BP)
4.Unilateral occlusive disease of the arteries

19 > HJ�ertension 
Hypertension {HT) is the silent killer of mankind. 
Most sufferers (85%) are asymptomatic and hence 
early diagnosis is a problem. The dividing line between 
normal and abnormal BP is arbitrary because BP is 
dependan t upon many factors like age, race, sex, etc. 
Definitions and Classification 
The definition ofhypertension is not universal because 
normal BP varies. The Sixth Joint National Committee 
Criteria (JNC VII) classifies hypertension for adults 
aged 18 years and older into the following stages: 
Table 2.7 : JNC VII Criteria for 
Classification of Blood Pressure 
Category Systolic Diastolic

I.Target BP is< 140mmHgsystolicand<90mmHg.
For diabetics OR chronic renal failure BP should
be:
< 130 mmHg systolic; < 80 mmHg diastolic
For diabetics WITH chronic renal failure BP 
should be:
< 125 mmHg systolic;< 75 mmHg diastolic
2.Hypertensive emergencies ( maligna nt
hypertens ion) are characterized by severe
elevations in BP (> 180/120 mmHg) with
evidence of impending or progressive target
organ dysfunction. They require immediate BP
reduction. (e.g.pappiledema, retinal exudates,
retinal hemorrhages, nephropathy, hypertensive
encephalopathy, intracerebral hemorrhage, acute
Ml, acute left ventricular failure with pulmonary
edema, unstable angina pectoris, dissecting aortic
aneurysm, eclampsia).
3.Hypertensive urgencies (accelerated
hypertension) are associated with severe
elevations in BP without progressive target
organ dysfunction (e.g. upper levels of stage II 

< 2 > General Examinat ion 
hypertension associated with severe headache, 
shortness of breath, epistaxis). Retinal damage 
may be present but without pappiledema. 
4.Isolated systolic hypertension is systolic BP;;;: 140
mmHg and diastolic BP <90 mmHg. It is seen
predominantly in elderly due to arteriosclerosis. It
may fluctuate from time to time, high in morning,
lower at night.
s.Pulse pressure = SBP • DBP (Normal 30-60
mmHg).
6.Mean BP= 2/3 DBP + 1/3 SBP.
Labile hypertension: The patient is hypertensive at 
one time and normotensive at another time. 
White Coat Hypertension: The patient's BP is high 
when measured by a professional but is normal when 
measured in casual circumstances (at home). It is 
diagnosed by 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring. 
Causes 
1.Essential Hypertension
2.Renal
a.Acute nephritis
b.Interstitial nephritis and pyelonephritis
c.Polycystic kidneys
d.Renal artery stenosis
e.Diabetic nephropathy
3.Endocrine: Pheochromoc ytoma, Cushing's
syndrome, thyrotoxicosis, myxedema
4.Neurological: Raised intracranial tension, lead
encephalopathy, etc.
5.Pregnancy induced HT
6.Cardiovascular HT: Co-arctation of aorta, aortic
regurgitation, arteriosclerosis
7.Drugs: Glucocorticoids, OCPs, sibutramine ,
cocaine, etc.
8.Miscellan eous: Polycythemia, polyarteritis
nodosa, obstructive sleep apnea,
hypercalcemia
Effects of Hypertension 
The common organs damaged by long-standing 
hypertension are heart, kidneys, blood vessels, 
retina 
and central nervous system. 1.CVS: Increased myocardial work leads to
concentric hypertrophy of left ventricle, angina
pectoris and accelerated coronary artery
disease. There is systolic as well as diastolic
dysfunction.
2.Kidneys: Progressive arteriosclerosis involves
both the efferent and afferent renal arterioles
and capillaries of glomerular tuft. This leads
to compromise in renal function, shrinkage of
kidney, proteinuria.
3.CNS:H ypertension may cause micro-aneurysms
(Charcot-Bouchard aneurysms) which may
rupture and cause cerebral hemorrhage .
Accelerated atherosclerosis may cause cerebral
thrombosis, embolism and infarction. Cerebral
arteriolar spasm may cause hypertensive
encephalopathy.
Sites of hypertens ive bleed are: cerebellum,
thalamus, basal ganglia (putamen), pons.
4.Fundus
Keith Wagner Classification
Grade I: Mild generalized arteriolar
attenuation.
Grade II: Deflection of veins at AV crossing
(AV nicking) + marked generalized arteriolar
attenuation.
Grade III: Grade II + copper wire + cotton
woolspots + flame-shaped hemorrhages + hard
exudate.
Grade IV: Grade III + silver wire + papilledema.
Symptoms 
The clinical features may be due to the elevated BP 
itself, target organ involvement or due to underlying 
disease, as in secondary hypertension. 
Symptoms due to hypertension 
1.Headache: This occurs usually in the morning
hours. It is throbbing and usually frontal.
2.Dizziness: The patient feels unsteady
3.Epistaxis: This occurs due to increased pressure
causing rupture of the capillaries of the nose. The
bleeding would reduce the circulating volume, and
lower the BP (Natures way oflowering the BP and
prevention of hemorrhage in the vital organs).

I.Non-pharmacological Treatment/ Lifestyle
Modifications
These have been practice over the years, even
when no drugs were available and their value
established. They help to control hypertension in
some, but are useful as adjuvants to drug treatment
in almost all patients. They include the following:
1.Salt restriction: Modest sodium restriction
to up to 110 mmoles/day (2.4 g sodium or 6
g sodium chloride) is effective in controlling
hypertension in mild to moderate hypertension
because sodium and water retention is involved
in large proportion of hypertensives.
2.Weight reduction:In overweight persons,
reduction of l kg may reduce 1.6/ l.3 mmHg
BP. It also modifies other CVS risk factors like
diabetes and dyslipidemia. BP is lowered by:
a.Reduced circulating volume which
reduces venous return and cardiac
output
b.Reduced sympathetic activity and
plasma nor-epinephrine
c.Reduction in hyperinsulinemia
3.Stop smoking: Smoking acutely raises BP.
In addition, it is an independent and most
important reversible coronary risk factor.
Since tolerance develops to nicotine-induced
hemodynamic effects, chronic smoking may
not be associated with high BP.
4.Diet:
A.Lactovegetarian 
diet and high intake
of polyunsaturated fish oils have high
potassium levels and lower BP by:
i.Increased sodium excretion
ii.Decreased sympathetic activity
iii.Decreased renin-angiotensin
secretion and direct dilatation of
renal arteries
B.Adequate calcium, magnesium intake
should be maintained in the diet.
C.Saturated fat and cholesterol intake
should be reduced for overall
cardiovascular health.
51 

52 5.Limit of alcohol intake to < l ounce/day of
ethanol {24 ounces beer, 8 ounces wine or 2
ounces 100-proof whiskey)
6.Relaxation: Various forms of relaxation like
yoga, biofeedback and psychotherapy lower
BP, especially in those with sympathetic
7.Regular exercise
II.Pharmacological Treatment
l.Diuretics: Oral diuretics were the most widely
used anti-hypertensive agents. They are
effective alone in 50% of mild hypertensives.
Thiazides are very effective. They are well
tolerated and need to be given only once
a day. They enhance the potency of other
anti-hypertens ives. They act by reducing
extracellular fluid volume and cardiac output
and they help to counteract the hypertensive
effect of high salt intake. They can aggravate
diabetes by suppressing release of insulin
due to hypokalemia. Hyperlipidemia,
hyperuricemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia,
hypomagnesemia may occur. Now they are
usually used in combination therapy.
2.Beta blockers: Reduce cardiac output and
lower BP but raise the peripheral resistance
on acute administration { which increases BP).
However, on chronic administration, BP falls
to pretreatment levels. In mild to moderate
hyper-tension, it lowers the BP to less than
90 mmHg in more than 50% patients. Drug
withdrawal, if needed, should be done slowly,
or rebound hypertension may occur. They can
be combined with diuretics, calcium blockers,
ace inhibitors and vasodilators. They may
precipitate bronchospasm, cardiac failure,
peripheral vascular disease, impotence and
depression.
3.Calcium Channel Blockers: Lower BP
by:
a. 
b. 
C. 
d. N atriuresis and diuresis due 
to increased 
GFR and decreased aldosterone 
Anti-angiotensin-11 effect 
Direct negative inotropic effect which 
lowers cardiac output 
Peripheral vasodilatation PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
Nifedipine was the commonest used calcium 
blocker. Now Amlodipine is replacing 
it. Felodipine, nicardipine, nitrendipine 
and dinidipine are other useful calcium 
blockers. These drugs are especially useful 
in elderly hypertensives. Flushing, headache, 
palpitations, edema and hypotension may 
occur. 
4.ACE Inhibitors: Renin released from the
kidney acts on circulating angiotensinogen
to produce angiotensin [, which is converted
to angiotensin II by converting enzyme.
Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor and
it stimulatesaldosterone, which 
retains sodium
and causes hyper-tension. ACE inhibitors
act by inhibiting the converting enzyme
preventing the formation of angiotensin II
and lowering ofBP. They also act by reducing
the degradation of bradykinin · 
a potent
vasodilator, which lowers the BP.
ACE Inhibitors cause regression of ventricular
hypertrophy, attenuation of reperfusion injury­
induced ventricular arrhythmias, preload
and afterload reduction and coronary vaso·
dilatation. These drugs have no adverse effects
oflipids, uric 
acid or glucose metabolism. They
lower the BP by 15-25%. Diastolic pressure
is lowered more 
than systolic pressure.
Concomitant sodium restriction and diuretics
further lowers BP by 15-25%.
ACE Inhibitors are useful in renovascular
hypertension. High angiotensin II is however
required to maintain adequate filtration
pressure behind the stenotic 
lesion. ACE
Inhibitors decrease the perfusion pressure and
lead to azotemia. Thus, they are contraindicated
in bilateral renal artery stenosis. These drugs
are useful in hypertensive diabetics because
of neutral effect of carbohydrate metabolism.
In addition they decrease microalbuminuria.
Captopril also improves insulin sensitivity.
It has a short duration of action 
and is used
for cardiac 
failure. Enalapril, lisinopril,
perindopril, ramipril, etc. are longer acting
ACE inhibitors and useful in hypertension.
Tissue specific ACE inhibitors like Quinapril,
Ramipril, Perindopril, Fosinopril are available.

< 2 ) General Examinati on 
5.Angiotensin II Blockers are useful in patients
with ACE Inhibitor-induced cough and in
elderly hypertensives. Losartan, Irbesartan,
Valsartan, Candersartan are available.
6.Alpha Blockers: Adrenergic stimulation of
alpha-I receptors in the vascular smooth
muscles causes vasoconstr iction and
hypertension. Alpha blockers attenuate
vasoconstric tion, and thereby decrease
vascular 
resistance and blood pressure.
Prazosin was the 
first alpha blocker with
short duration of action. Terazosin and
doxazosin are longer acting, once a day alpha
blockers. The efficacy can be enhanced by
the concomitant use of diuretics. The most
dramatic 
adverse effect is the first dose postural
hypotension/ syncope.
Alpha blockers also have other beneficial
effects like lowering of lipids, regression
of left ventricular hypertrophy, enhancing
insulin sensitivity (hence ideal for diabetic
hypertensives) and relief of obstructive
symptoms in benign prostatic hypertrophy.
7.Vasodilators: These drugs act on the arteriolar
smooth muscles, causing vasodilatation and
lowering of BP. However, reflex tachycardia
and increase in cardiac 
output limits its
usefulness in severe coronary artery disease.
These effects can be reduced by combining
hydralazine with beta blockers. Minoxidil
is the other vasodilator whose usefulness is
limited due to hi 
rsutism in females. Diazoxide
and nitroprusside are parenteral vasodilators
useful in hypertensive emergencies.
20 > Hi�otension 
Definition: Hypotension is diminished blood pressure. 
This could be acute or chronic. 
Acute Recumbent 
Hypotension 
Causes 
l.Cardiovascular: Acute myocardial infarction,
pulmonary embolism, dissecting aneurysm,
ventricular tachycardia, cardiac rupture2.Intravascular volume contraction: Hemorrhage,
vomiting, diarrhea, burns, intestinal obstruction,
peritonitis, etc.
3.Anaphylaxis
4.Gram negative septicemia
Clinical 
Features 
I.Due to shock: Tachycardia, vomiting, fainting
2.Due to causative disease
3.In vasovagal attacks, hypotension with bradycardia
4.In postural hypotension, fall of BP occurs on
suddenly on assuming an erect posture from
supine posture
Treatment 
l.Of the cause
2.Posture: The patient should be in lying position
with legs raised.
3.For vasovagal attacks: Atropine 0.6 mg IV
4.For anaphylaxis: Hydrocortisone hemi-succinate
I 00 mg IV, repeated as required
5.For postural hypotension: This is best treated by
advising the patients to assume the erect posture
slowly and to wear elastic stockings and abdominal
binder.
6.Vasoconstrictors: Dopamine, nor-epinephrine and
ephedrine have been tried.
7.Salt: Adequate amount of salt (NaCl) in diet helps
to expand the plasma volume.
8.Fludrocortisone Acetate: (0.1 -0.2 mg) causes fluid
retention and avoids 
postural fall of BP.
Chronic Hypotension 
A number of healthy subjects have a systolic BP of 
80-100 mm Hg, which is compatible with long life
expectancy. 0 nlysome patients complain of weakness,
lethargy, easy fatigability, dizziness and fainting on
assuming erect posture or standing inactive for long
periods. This occurs due to interference with neural
pathways between the vasomotor center and efferent
sympathetic nerve endings in the blood vessels and
heart, so that the normal rise in cardiac 
output and va­
soconstriction on assuming erect posture are abolished.

Shy-Drager Syndrome 
This is chronic orthostatic hypotension with degenera­
tion of CNS, mainly involving extra-pyramidal tracts, 
basal ganglia and dorsal nucleus of Vagus. These pa· 
tients have intact peripheral autonomic 
nervous system 
but are unable to activate it. (In primary autonomic 
insufficiency there is depletion of nor-epinephrine 
in the peripheral autonomic ganglia). In both these, 
catecholamine blood levels do not rise on standing, 
although it may be normal at recumbency in chronic 
orthostatic hypotension but reduced in primary au­
tonomic insufficiency.

A.Inspection
The abdomen can be divided in to 9 regions by
drawing 2 horizontal and 2 vertical imaginery
lines. The 2 vertical lines are drawn by joining
mid clavicular point to the mid inguinal point.
The upper horizontal line is drawn at the lower
most bony point of the rib cage, usually the
9th or 10th costal cartilage (Sub costal plane •
corresponds to the body ofL3 vertebra). The lower
horizontal line is drawn at the upper border of
the tubercles of the iliac crests (Trans tubercular
plane -corresponds to the upper border of LS
vertebra). The 9 quadrants are shown in Figure.
I.Shape of Abdomen : The shape of the
abdomen in most normal persons with
normal musculature is scaphoid or boat­
shaped i.e. the abdominal wall sinks slightly
within the bony margins of the abdominal
surface.
In every muscular person, the lateral
margins of the rectus muscle is visible in
the center. Usually the medial edges of both
the recti are contiguous. However they may
be separated as a congenital defect, after
pregnancy or with obesity and ascites. This
is called divarication of recti. Distension of
the abdomen occurs due to fat (obesity),
fluid (ascites), feces, flatus, fetus, full
urinary bladder and (fatal) new-growth.PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
They can be differentiated as follows: 
1.Fat : Pendulous abdomen with
symmetrical, globular, enlarged and
accentuated cutaneous folds
2.Fluid : Fluid thrill, shifting and
horseshoe dullness
3.Flatus: Generalized tympany more at 
the periphery
4.Feces: Generalized distension occurs,
more in the flanks. Fecal masses may
be felt.
5.Fetus: Central dullness, tympany in
the flanks, history of amenorrhea and
fetal parts may be palpable
6.Full bladder: Tender, rounded, cystic
massmaybe palpableabovesymphysis
pubis, which may disappear after
micturition
7.Fatal new growth:
a.Abdominal dullness overlying the
growth
b. In ovarian growth, the distance
between the umbilicus and
symphysis pubis is greater than
that between the xiphisternum
and umbilicus
Fig 3 1 lnspect,onofAbdomen-9Quadrants 

( 3) Abdomen
Generalized distension occurs 
.in ascites, obesity and patients 
with excessive flatus. Localized 
distension occurs with individual 
visceromegaly and with 
neoplasms, e.g. hepatomegaly 
produces abdominal distension 
in 
the right hypochondriac 
region whereas full bladder 
produces marked distension of 
hypogastrium. 
Scaphoid or sunken abdomen 
is seen with starvation and 
malignancy, especially of stomach 
and esophagus. 
II.Umbilicus: Normal umbilicus is usually
inverted and situated centrally in the
mid-abdomen. The distance between the
xiphisternum and the umbilicus is equal
to the distance between the umbilicus and
symphysis pubis.
In ascites, the distance between xiphisternum
and umbilicus is greater than that between
umbilicus and symphysis pubis, whereas
in ovarian tumor the distance between
xiphisternum and umbilicus is less than that
between umbilicus and symphysis pubis.
In ascites, the umbilicus is transversely
stretched (smiling) or flattened or everted
whereas in obesity, the umbilical cleft is
deeper than normal.
Everted umbilicus may occur with
hem iation ofbowel or fat into the widened
umbilical ring. Sometimes, umbilicus
may exude fluid e.g. 
ascitic fluid in
massive ascites or feculent material in
enteric 
fistulae, or clear fluid in patent
urachus (crying umbilicus). A faint blue
discolouration around the umbilicus
(Cullen's sign) or 
in one or both flanks
(Grey Turner's 
sign) may occur in acute
hemorrhagic pancreatitis or ruptured
ectopic pregnancy. Cherry 
red swelling of
the umbilicus suggests inflamed Meckel's
diverticulum.III.Abdominal Movements: Normally
the abdominal wall bulges during
inspiration and falls during expiration.
In diaphragmatic paralysis the abdomen
bulges during expiration. In peritonitis,
the abdominal movements are absent.
IV.Pulsations: Normally pulsations are not
visible over the abdomen. They may be
visible in the 
following conditions:
1.Aortic pulsations are visible in the
nervous, anemic individual.
2.Aortic aneurysm produces expansile
pulsations in any position.
3.Transmitted pulsations from a tumor
overlying the aorta disappear in knee­
elbow position because the tumor falls
away from the aorta in that position.
This is not so if the tumor is adherent
to the aorta.
4.Right ventricular pulsations are
seen 
only in the epigastrium and
correspond with apex beat
5.Congestedliver, in addition, produces
pulsations posteriorly.
V.Dilated Veins: Suggest venous obstruction.
When dilated veins are present, the
direction of the blood flow 
can be found
by emptying ( milking) a section of the vein
and pressing each 
end of the emptied part
with a finger. One finger is released and the
57 

58 Fig 3 3 Dilatedveinsovertheabdomen Left Inferior 
vena cava obstruction {flowfrom below upwards) 
Middle· Supenorvena cava obstruction (flow from 
above downwards). Right. Portal ve1 n obstruction (ca put 
medusae) 
. � -
filling of the vein is noted. Similarly, the 
other finger is released and filling of the 
vein is noted. Blood enters more rapidly 
and fills the vein from the direction of the 
blood flow. 
In inferior vena cava obstruction there 
will be dilated veins on the sides with flow 
of blood from below upwards. This occurs 
because the blood bypasses the inferior 
vena cava and travels from the lower limbs 
to the thorax via the veins of the abdominal 
wall. These veins are anastomotic channels 
between the superficial epigastric vein and 
circumflex iliac veins below and the lateral 
thoracic vein above conveying the diverted 
blood from the long saphenous vein to the 
axillary vein. 
In portal vein obstruction, the engorged 
veins are centrally placed and may form 
a cluster around the umbilicus (caput 
medusa). The blood in these veins flows VI. PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
in all directions away from the umbilicus. 
They represent opening of anastomosis 
between portal and systemic veins. 
Peristalsis : Peristalsis is best elicited by 
patiently observing the abdomen of the 
patient. If it is not visible, an attempt to 
visualize it should be made either by making 
the patient swallow fluids or by applying a 
sharp tap with the fingerover the abdominal 
wall. 
Peristaltic wave of the stomach is seen in 
pyloric stenosis in the epigastrium and 
left hypochondriac region, moving from 
left to right. Peristaltic wave of the large 
intestine (transverse colon) is seen in the 
same region but moving from right to left. 
Peristaltic wave of small intestine is seen 
in a ladder pattern down the centre of the 
abdomen. 
VII.Hernial Sites: The hernial sites in the groin
should be seen for any swelling. If there is
no swelling, the patient should be asked
to stand up, turn his head to one side and
cough. If there is an impulse on coughing
it suggests hernia.
To differentiate between femoral and
inguinal hernia, the index finger of the
examiner is placed on the pubic tubercle
(traced up along the tendon of adductor
longus) and the patient asked to cough. If
the impulse is medial and above the index
finger it is inguinal hernia. If the impulse
tends to bulge straight out through the
posterior wall of the inguinal canal, it is
direct, whereas if it travels down obliquely
along the inguinal canal, it is indirect.
VIII.Skin Over the Abdomen: Smooth and
glossy skin indicates abdominal distension
whereas wrinkled skin suggests old
distension which has been relieved.
Abdominal striae ( stretch marks) represent
the rupture of subepidermal connective
tissue as a result of recent or past
abdominal distension. It is seen commonly
following pregnancy, in obesity, in massive
ascites and following corticosteroid

( 3 )Abdomen 
therapy. When they first form, the striae are 
reddish or pink. If the state of distension 
stabilizes or the cause regresses, the colour 
fades to white. 
B, Palpation 
For palpation of the abdomen, the patient must 
lie on his back, shoulders raised slightly and legs 
flexed to relax the abdomen. He should keep his 
mouth open and breathe quietly and deeply. The 
abdomen is palpated with the flat of the hand 
initially, but the fingers are used to locate the 
margins of any viscera or tumor. 
I.Tenderness: Tenderness is pain on pressure.
It is commonly found in inflammatory
lesions of the viscera and the surrounding
peritoneum.
The site of tenderness often suggests the
diagnosis
1.In the epigastrium -Peptic ulcer
2.In the right hypochondriurn -Hepatitis,
cholecystitis
3.In the right iliac fossa -Appendicitis
(Mc Burney's Point)
4.Purely visceral pain such as gastric or
intestinal colic is not associated with
any tenderness.
Rebound tenderness can be elicited by 
exerting a firm pressure with the hand 
and releasing it. In deep seated, subacute 
Fig 3 5 S1teoftendernessin I l) Hepat1t1sandcholecyst1t1 s, 
(2) Peptic ulcer,(3)Append1c1t1s and (4) Col1t1s conditions, the patient complains of severe 
pain (e.g. appendicitis). 
II.Guarding : Abdominal guarding is due to
muscular contraction, which often occurs
as a part of the defense mechanism over
a tender region. If the patient is put in a
comfortable position and his mind set at
rest by explaining that no undue pain will be 
caused by the examination, the abdominal
muscles gradually relax.
III.Rigidity: Abdominal rigidity is due to
muscular contraction, which occurs as a
part of the defense mechanism over an
inflamed organ. It cannot be voluntarily
relaxed. It occurs in the following:
1.Perforation of a hollow organ
2.Peritonitis
3.Acute pancreatitis or cholecystitis
4.Intestinal strangulation
5.Thrombosis of superior mesenteric
artery
6.Ruptured ectopic gestation
7.Twisted ovarian cyst or torsion of
fibroid
Pancreatobili ary secretions are more 
irritating to the peritoneum than bacteria 
are, and so board-like rigidity suggests 
a chemical peritonitis most commonly 
from perforated gastric or duodenal ulcer. 
Bacterial peritonitis rarely produces board­
like rigidity until late. It usually causes 
increased resistance to compression. 
IV.Viscera
A.Liver: The patient must be lying in
the supine position with hip and knee
flexed, to relax abdominal muscles.
The examiner moves his right hand
from the right iliac fossa gradually
upwards until a sense of increased
resistance is noted. The size of the liver
must be recorded as fingerbreadths
or centimeters below right costal
margin. The liver edge is accurately
located by the fingertips. It is normally
59 

60 sharp, firm and regular. The surface 
of the liver is palpated next. Normally 
it is smooth. An irregular nodular 
surface indicates cirrhosis. Liver may 
be enlarged and pulsatile in tricuspid 
regurgitati on. 
B.Spleen can be palpated by following
methods:
1.Classical: The patient is put in
the supine position and palpatedPRACTICAL MEDICINE 
from the right iliac fossa to the left 
hypochondriac region. The edge 
of the spleen may be felt on deep 
inspiration. 
2.Bimanual: The patient is put in
the right lateral position, one
hand of the examiner is put over
the lower chest and the spleen is
palpated with the other hand. A
soft spleen, which may be missed
by the classical method, may be
palpated by this method.
3.Hooking: The patient is put in
right lateral position and the
examiner stands on the left side
and feels the spleen by hooking his
fingers over the left costal margin.
Fig. 3. IO: PJlf),1l1on of Sµlecn -Hooking Method 
- --------- - . .. 
4.Dipping: This method is used
when there is severe ascites
which may mask an enlarged

( 3) Abdomen
spleen. The patient is put in the 
supine position and the examiner 
palpates as in the classical method 
exceptthat he dips his fing-ers into 
the abdomen with each palpation, 
so that the fluid is displaced 
temporarily to the side. This 
facilitates palpation of the spleen.

Massive: Extending up to umbilicus 
or beyond Causesofsplenomegaly: (Refer Pg.67) 
C.Gall bladder: The gall bladder is
palpated in a similar manner as liver.
Normally it is not palpable. When
distended, it is palpated as a firm,
smooth, rounded or globular swelling
with distinct borders just lateral to
the rectus abdominis muscle. Its
upper border merges with the lower
border ofliver or disappears beneath
the costal cartilage and hence is not
usually felt.
D. 
E. Causes of enlarged gall bladder:
l.Carcinoma of the head of
the pancreas and malignant
obstruction of the common bile
duct. This is associated with
jaundice (courvoisier's law).
2.Mucocele of the gall bladder due
to impaction ofa stone at the neck
of the gall-bladder. Here there is
no jaundice
3.Carcinoma of the gall bladder
Kidneys: The left kidney is palpated 
by keeping the left hand posteriorly in 
the loin and the right hand anteriorly 
in the left lumbar region. Then the 
patient takes a breath, the left hand is 
pressed forwards and the right hand 
backwards, upwards and inwards. The 
right kidney is likewise palpated on 
the right side. Normally the kidneys 
are not palpable unless placed low in 
position or enlarged. Its lower pole 
is felt as a rounded firm swelling 
between both the hands (bimanual 
palpation) and can be pushed from 
one hand to the other (ballotable). 
Abdomen: Doughy feel of abdomen 
in TB peritonitis. 
C.Percussion
Uniform enlargement of the abdomen may be
because of gas or fluid in the abdomen. In the
former there is tympanic note on percussion
while in the latter there is dullness.
61 

62 1.Shiftingdullness: This is seen with moderate
ascites. The abdomen is percussed starting
from the midline. The upper border offluid
in each flank is determined. The pleximeter
finger is kept in position on one flank and
the patient is turned to the other side. After
waiting for about 15 seconds, percussion at
the same point produces a tympanic note
as the intestines float up. The abdomen is
then percussed towards the other flank.
There is an increased width of dullness on
the other side due to shift of fluid.
2.Horseshoe shaped dullness: This is seen
with moderate ascites. The abdomen is
percussed in various directions from the
umbilicus outwards. Area of dullness
appears horse-shaped with a concave upper
border. This is because fluid accumulates
in the dependent parts and the intestines
float up.PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
Tympanic note 
(Gas) 
Dull note 
(Fluidl 
Fig 3 14 Horseshoe shaped dullness on percussion ! 
3.Fluid thrill: This is seen in tense ascites.
One hand is kept over one flank and a sharp
flick is delivered with the other hand over
the opposite flank. The patient is asked to
keep ulnar edge of one hand in the midline.
A tap is felt by the palpating hand in case
of tense ascites.
4.Puddles Sign: It is to be elicited in minimal
ascites (150 ml). The patient is asked to go
"on all fours" so the fluid collects in the
mid-abdomen which is dependant. One
flank is lightly flicked with one hand and
the most dependant part is auscultated.
The chestpiece of the stethoscope is then
moved to the opposite flank. A change in the
intensity of the note heard indicates fluid.
In addition to determining fluid, percussion
helps to delineate the outline of an enlarged

( 3)Abdomen
viscera or abdominal tumor. It helps to 
differentiate enlarged spleen (dull note) 
from an enlarged left kidney (resonant 
note because of the intervening colon). ----, 
5.Tidal Percussion : The upper border of
the liver can be accurately determined by
percussion.
Liver Span: Percussion is started anteriorly
in the right midclavicular line from second
intercostal space downwards and repeated
in the anterior, mid and posterior axillary
lines and the scapular line posteriorly.
The normal liver dullness is in the fifth
space in the midclavicular, seventh space
in the anterior axillary and ninth space in
the scapular lines. The normal liver span
in an adult as judged by liver dullness
measures 10-12 cm in men and 8-11 cm
in women. The upper border of the liver
may be percussed in the fourth or thirdD. space in the midclavicular line in patients 
with amebic abscess ofliver or any abscess 
on the superior surface of liver. The liver 
dullness is lower in the sixth or seventh 
right intercostal space in emphysema, right­
sided pneumothorax, when there is air in 
the peritoneal cavity, acute yellow atrophy 
of the liver and in terminal cirrhosis. 
Auscultation 
Auscultation of the abdomen is done for the 
following: 
1.Peristalsis : These are intestinal sounds
generated by contractions of the muscular
walls of the gut and the resultant vibration
of the gut wall produced by movement of
a gas-fluid mixture through the gut. These
bowel sounds (peristalsis) persist in the
fasting state due to the presenceofintestinal
secretions and swallowed air. Loud bowel
sounds (hyperperistalsis) accompanied
by abdominal distension and crampy
abdominal pain suggests partial bowel
obstruction. Absence of bowel sounds for
at least 5 minutes strongly suggests bowel
atony or ileus. Borborygm i refers to audible
peristalsis which can be heard even without
a sthethoscope.
2.Arterial Bruit: These are variable harsh
sounds in tempo with the pulse due to
turbulence in arterial flow. This may
occur by unusually acute angulations at 
arterial branch points, arteriosclerotic
plaques, extreme tortuosity of an artery,
compression of an artery or massive blood
flow through very vascular tumors like
hemangioma or hepatoma. Bruits over
the liver suggests very vascular tumor like
hepatoma or angioma. Similarly, over the
spleen it suggests vascular tumor. Bruit
over the aorta, if soft, has no significance.
However a loud bruit suggests aortic
aneurysm, atherosclerosis or extreme
tortuosity of the aorta, Bruit over the
kidneys in the flanks suggests renal artery
stenosis.
63 

64 3.Venous Hum: Venous hum is continuous,
softer and lower pitched than bruit. It
signifies portal systemic shunting of venous
flow when portal flow is obstructed. It 
is usually heard over the liver area and 
umbilicus.
Fetor Hepaticus 
Definition : This is the fecal smell of the breath similar 
to that of a freshly opened corpse of a mouse. 
Mechanism: Normal demethylating process is inhib­
ited by liver damage. Hence, methionine is converted 
to methyl mercaptan, which gives the typical smell. 
Causes 
I.Acute liver cell disease/failure: Poor prognostic
sign and often precedes coma.
2.Extensive portal collateral circulation
Spider Nevi 
Synonyms: Arterial spider, Spider telangiectasis, Spider 
angioma 
Definition: An arterial spider is a central arteriole, 
from which numerous small vessels radiate resembling 
a spider's legs. 
Sites: Arterial spiders are found in the territory of the 
superior vena cava. They are commonly seen on the 
face, neck, forearm and shoulder. 
Appearance: They range in size from 3 to 15 mm in 
diameter. They are pulsatile and blanch on pressure. 
When the skin is stretched or compressed they fill 
from the centre to the periphery. 
Fig. 3 18 Spider nevi PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
Small vessels in the skin associated with arterial spiders 
have been compared to the silk thread in American 
paper money. Therefore, the skin is called paper 
money skin. 
Causes 
1.In alcoholics 5.Pregnancy
2.Cirrhosis 6.Rheumatoid arthritis
3.Viral hepatitis 7.Thyrotoxicosis
4.Normal persons especially children
Mechanism: The selective distribution of spider nevi 
is not understood. 
1. 
2. Exposure of upper parts of the body to certain 
elements may damage the skin so that it is 
susceptible to develop spider nevi when an 
appropriate internal stimulus exists. 
Estrogen exce�s may be responsible. It forms 
arterioles of the endometrium in uterus during 
pregnancy, which resembles spider nevi. 
Significance : Appearance of fresh spiders suggests 
progression ofliver damage. Spider nevi disappear if 
liver function improves or blood pressure falls due to 
shock or hemorrhage. 
Palmar Erythema 
Definition : Palmar erythema is bright red warm 
palms. The thenar and hypothenar eminences and 
soles of feet are especially erythematous. The erythema 
blanches on pressure. 
Causes 
1. 
2. In alcoholics 
Cirrhosis 
3.Viral hepatitis
4.Thyrotoxicosis

7.Pregnancy
8.Febrile diseases
9.Familial
Significance : Palmar erythema is not so frequently 
seen in cirrhosis, as are vascular spiders. 
Asterixis (Flaps) 
Definition : Asterixis are rapid flexion-extension 
movements at metacarpop halangeal and wrist joints. 
Therefore they are seen as a flapping tremor. 
Significance : In liver disease, it indicates that the 
patient is in hepatocellular failure.

Definition : Splenomegaly is an enlargement of the 
spleen (Refer Pg. 55). The spleen has to be two and a 
halftimes its normal size to become palpable; therefore 
an enlarged spleen is not always palpable. In ptosis of 
spleen, it is palpable, though not enlarged. 
Evidence of Enlargement of Spleen 
1. Predominant left sided abdominal distension,
if massive splenomegaly
2. Splenic mass moves downwards on inspiration
3.A notch is felt on the anterior border
4.Left abdominal pain if massive splenomegaly
Causes 
I.Infective:
A.Bacterial: Septicemia, SBE, typhoid,
syphilis.
B.Viral: Infective hepatitis, infectious
mononucle osis
C.Protozoa/: Malaria, kala azar,

Physical Examination 
I.General
Appearance: Anemic, jaundiced or emaciated.
Lymph nodes, especially supraclavicular.
II.Local
A.Inspection:
l.Skin overlaying
2.Position, size, shape and surface
3. Movement on respiration
4.Hernial sites
5.Scrotum
B.Palpation:
1.Local temperature
2.Tenderness
3.Muscular rigidity
4.Confirming inspection findings
regarding the lump
5.Margins: It must be determined
whether it is possible to get all round
the lump or not, well defined or ill­
defined, notch present or absentPRACTICAL MEDICINE 
6.Consistency: Soft, firm or hard. Hard
swellings are usually malignant, soft
swelling may be cystic.
7.Mobility: This should be determined
by hand in all directions, i.e. from side
to side and above downward.
8.Parietal or intra-abdominal: This
can be found out by making the
abdominal muscles taut by raising
the shoulders or the legs. If the
lump becomes less prominent it is
intra-abdominal. If it becomes more
prominent it is parietal. If mobile over
the contracted muscles it is superficial
to the muscles and if it is fixed it is
adherent to the muscle
9.Hernial sites for expansile impulse on
coughing
10.Pulsations (if present): Expansile
(aortic) or transmitted (lump over
aorta). If lump is not adherent to
aorta, pulsations disappear when the
patient is in knee-chest position.
C.Percussion:
1.For dullness of the tumor
2.Dullness over liver and spleen or
resonance over kidneys
3.Fluid thrill and shifting dullness
present in ascites, absent in ovarian
tumor
D.Auscultation: For rub (perisplenitis and
perihepatitis)
Differential Diagnosis 
Abdominal Quadiants : The differential diagnosis of 
abdominal lump can be made based on location of the 
lump in one of the abdominal quadrant. 
The abdomen 
is divided into nine regions by 
four imaginary planes ( two horizontal and two 
vertical). 
Two horizontal planes are transpylonic and 
transtubercular planes. 
Transpyloric plane -It passes through the tips of 
the 9th costal cartilage anteriorly and through 
j 

{ 3 > Abdomen 
the body of LI Vertebra near its lower body 
posteriorly. 
Transtubercular plane • It passes through the 
tubercles of the iliac crest and the body of LS 
vertebra. 
Two vertical lines are the right & left lateral 
planes corresponding to the midclavicular line 
or either side. 
Right Hypochondriac Region 
I.Swellings in the Abdominal Wall Cold
Abscess
1.Fluctuant swelling with no signs of
inflammation
2.Swelling becomes prominent when the
abdominal muscles contract
3.Irregularity in the affected rib or deformity
of the spine.
II.Intra-Abdominal Swellings
A.Hepatic
I.It moves with respiration but is not
mobile sideways
2.The swelling is continuous with
the 
liver dullness without a band of
colonic resonance
B.Gall Bladder
1.Oval smooth swelling, the size of an
egg
2.Moveswith respiration, can be moved
sideways but cannot be pushed down
into the loin (like kidney swelling)
Chronic Cholecystitis and Cholelithiasis 
I.Pain over the right rectus muscle
radiating to the inferior angle of
scapula, aggravated after fatty meals.
Often the patient makes an attempt
to get relief by frequent belching
or vomiting but relief is seldom
complete.
2.Gall bladder may be palpable.
3.Murphy's sign is positive: i.e.
Tenderness under the right costal
margin at the lateral border of the
rectus muscle when the patient takes
a deep breath. This occurs due to thedescent of the inflamed gallbladder, 
which touches the examiner's fingers. 
If a stone is present in the common 
bile duct there is a triad of intermittent 
colic, intermittent jaundice 
and fever 
with chills and rigors. 
4.Courvoisier's law: In a patient with
obstructive jaundice, a palpable gall
bladder is seldom due to gall stones.
This is because the gall bladder is
usually shriveled & non distendable
in long standing gall stone disease.
Therefore, in a pt. with obstructive
jaundice, a palpable gall bladder
indicates malignancy of gall bladder
or pancreas.
Exceptions to courvoisiers law i.e.
Obstructive jaundice with a palpable
gall bladder due to gall stone occurs
in
i.Double impaction oft he stone (in
the bile duct & in the cystic duct)

is anicteric in 50% of patients. Usually seen in 
children below 15 years age. 
2.Hepatitis B Virus: This is a DNA virus
transmitted parenterally. The incubation period
is 2-25 weeks. About 10% of patients develop
chronic disease or a carrier state.

chronic hepatitis, 50% of which is chronic active
hepatitis which would ultimately lead to cirrhosis
of liver.
4.Hepatitis D Virus or Delta agent: This is a small

Hepatitis E Virus (formerly called enterically 
transmitted non-A non-B hepatitis) is an 
RNA virus. It resembles Hepatitis A, is 
transmitted by feco-oral route and is found to 
occur in endemic areas like India, Asia, Africa 
and Central America. It is seen to occur in 
individuals who are immune to HAY infection. 
Usually seen in adults and used to be wrongly 
labelled as 'A' in the past. 
Hepatitis F, G and H viruses have been recently 
described. 
Other viruses: Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalo 
virus, herpes simplex virus, rubella virus and 
virus of yellow fever may all cause hepatitis. 
Oinical Features 
1.Influenza-like syndrome is common in hepatitis
A with malaise, anorexia and fatigue

II.To diagnose the type of hepatitis (Tables and
Figs. 3.8, 3.9 &3.10)
1.In Hepatitis A, anti-HAV IgM antibody is
elevated early followed by anti-HAV IgG
in 2-3 months.
2.In Hepatitis B, HBsAg is positive. In acute
recent infection anti-HBeAb denotes
marked infectivity. HBsAg +ve for >6
months indicates carrier state (See Table).
3.In Hepatitis C, anti-HCV may be positive,
especially in chronic carriers. The most
sensitive indication is the presence ofHCV
RNA.
4.In Hepatitis D, HDAg or rising anti-HDV
antibody titre may be present.
5.In Hepatitis E, anti-HEV antibodies or
HEV RNA may be present.
Treatment 
1. 
2. Rest: Prolonged bed rest is not usually needed 
but patients feel better with restricted activities. 
Nutrition: A high calorie diet should be given. 
It is usually given in the morning because many 3. patients experience nausea in the evening. If 
there is persistent vomiting, intravenous fluids 
must be given. Usually excessive fatty foods are 
not tolerated well and are hence avoided. 
Drugs: There are no specific drugs useful for 
viral hepatitis. All hepatotoxic drugs as well as 
alcohol must be withdrawn. 
4.For post hepatitis syndrome: The patient requires
reassurance.

be given within 2 weeks of contact in the 
dose of 0.02 ml/kg_ For travelers a dose 
0.06 ml/kg should be given every 6 months. 
Hepatitis A vaccine is now available-
b. Hepatitis B: A vaccine for active 
immunization has been prepared from 
HBsAg carrier serum as well as by genetic 
engineering from recombinant yeast. 
For pre-exposure prophylaxis, Hepatitis B 
vaccine must be given at 0, l and 6-month 
interval. The dose is 20 mcg LM. for 
immuno-compromised adults and 10 mcg 
I.M. for infants and children under 10 years.
For post-exposure cases, a combination 
of HBIG (for rapid achievement of high 
circulating titre of anti-HBs) and hepatitis 
B vaccine (for long lasting immunity) is 
given. 

-( 3)Abdomen
For perinatal exposure of infantsofHBsAg 
positive.mothers, HBIG 0.5 ml should be 
given in thigh at birth followed by Hepatitis 
B vaccine IO mcg started with a week of 
birth and repeated at I and 6 months. 
For percutaneous exposure a single dose 
of0.06 ml/kgofHBIG is given followed by 
three doses of hepatitis B vaccine. 
Usually patients retain protective levels for 
5 years after complete vaccination. 
c.HepatitisD: There is no immunoprophylaxis
to prevent delta superinfection. Susceptible
persons are vaccinated with Hepatitis B
vaccine.
d.Hepatitis C and E: IG prophylaxis in this
hepatitis is not known to be beneficial and
is not recommended.
Variants of Acute Viral Hepatitis 
I.Fulminant hepatitis: There is rapid onset ofliver
failure due to rapid liver cell necrosis which
occurs due to modification of host response to
viral infection, allowing rapid viral replication
Hepatitis B and C and superinfection with
delta agent accounts for majority of the
cases. Mortality in 3 weeks is 30% and 90-
100% above age 60 die. Clinically there is
progressive jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy
and hepatorenal syndrome prothrombin time
is elevated.
2.Cholestatic hepatitis: There are features of
obstructive jaundice with alkaline phosphatase
elevated more than SGPT, during the course
of viral hepatitis. It is to be differentiated from
biliary obstruction. The prognosis is excellent,
recovery occurs over few months.
3.Relapsing hepatitis: This occurs several weeks or
months after apparent recovery. Sometime s it 
may be a second bout of hepatitis with a different 
virus. 
4.Viral hepatitis with autoimmune features: It
occurs in 5% of patients with Hepatitis B due
to circulating immune complexes.
Anorexia, malaise, fatigue, urticaria, angioedema
migrating arthralgia and non-deformingarthritis of knee, ankle and wrist may occur 
along with vasculitis and glomerulonephritis. 
Prognosis is excellent as these rarely persist 
beyond 2 weeks. 
5.Hepatitis with aplastic anemia: This is rarely seen
with acute viral hepatitis. The mortality rate is
high and no treatment has been effective.
Chronic Viral Hepatitis 
Overview 
•Chronic hepatitis is a condition characterised
by persistent liver inflammation for more than
6 months after initial exposure or diagnosis of
liver disease.
Cause of chronic hepatitis are : a) chronic viral
hepatitis (hep. B, Hep. C); b) Auto immune
hepatitis; c) Drug induced; d) Cryptogenic
(unknown cause).
•Complications of chronic hepatitis include
cirrhosis, portal HT, liver failure & HCC
(hepatocellular carcinoma).
Chronic Hepatitis B (CHBJ 
•The risk of chronicity depends on the age &
immune function when a person is infected.
Infection at birth is associated with a 90%
chance of chronic infection while injection in
young adulthood in immunocompetent person
is associated with a risk of chronicity of only
approximat ely 1-5%.
Symptoms of chronic hepatitis range from none,
to non specific complaints (fatigue, Right upper
quadrant pain), to complication of cirrhosis.
•Extrahepatic manifestation, occur in up to 20%
of patients with CHB & include arthralgias,
PAN, glomerulonephritis mixed essential
cryoglobulinemia, polymyalgia rheumatica
and papular aero dermatitis (Gianotti Crosti
Syndrome in children).

8 > Cirrhosis of Liver 
Definition 
Cirrhosis of liver is chronic diffuse liver disease of 

( 3 > Abdomen 
varied etiology and characterized by hepatic cell 
necrosis, resulting in collapse, proliferation of connec, 
tive tissue (fibrosis), nodular regeneration and altered 
intrahepatic circulation. 
Classification 
1.Viral Hepatitis: Hepatitis B, C and D may lead
to cirrhosis ofliver.
2.Alcohol: An intake of about 80 gm of alcohol
daily, for 15 years, may lead to cirrhosis.
3.Prolonged cholestasis
4, Cardiac failure oflong duration induces fibrosis
around the central vein.
5.Drugs: INH-Isoniazid, methotrexate and
methyldopa may cause cirrhosis.
6.Congenital disorders:
7. a.Hemachromatosis: Excessive iron absorption
and deposition in the liver leads to cirrhosis.
0 ther features are diabetes, bronze colored
skin and myocarditis.
b.Wilson's disease: Excessive deposition of
copper leads to cirrhosis. Other features
are lenticular degeneration (involuntary
movements, rigidity), greenish 
yellow ring
at the limbus of cornea (Kayser Fleischer
ring) and deficiency of ceruloplasmin.
c.Galactosemia: There is deficiency of the
enzyme galactose -1-phosphate-uridyl
transferase. Galactose from milk is not
converted to glucose. Infants on milk diet
may have malnutrition, diarrhea, jaundice,
cataract and hepatosplenomegaly with
cirrhosis ofliver.
d.Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency: The normal
levels of this enzyme are 150-350 mg/L.
Levels less than 80 mg/Lmaycause cirrhosis
(mechanism unclear), pancreatitis and
recurrent lung infections with emphysema.
Miscellaneous: 
a.Nutrition: A diet low in proteins especially
in methionine and choline may cause
fatty liver and cirrhosis. A diet rich in
unsaturated fats (as in vegetable oils)
may increase the susceptibility of liver
to cirrhosis. Similarly, a diet very richin calories and carbohydrates may cause 
relative protein deficiency and contribute 
to liver necrosis by infections and toxins. 
b.Infections: Malaria, kala-azaranddysentery
cause malnutrition and contribute to
cirrhosis. Schistosomiasis produces hepatic
fibrosis, which may progress to cirrhosis.
c.Toxins: Aflatoxin-contaminated foodstuffs
may produce cirrhosis. It is produced when
groundnuts, pulses or other nuts stored in
moist conditions get contaminated with a
fungus • Aspergillus flavus.
d.Autoimmunity: Autoimmune antibodies
as produced in SLE may lead to cirrhosis.
e.Cryptogenic: The cause of cirrhosis is not
identified.
Pathology 
The liver is firm, has a gritty feel on cutting and the 
cut surface shows fibrous bands surrounding nodules 
of various sizes. 
Microscopic examination would show necrosis, col­
lapse, fibrosis, regeneration and altered circulation. 
Regenerating nodules, by compressing the blood 
supply of the liver cause ischemic damage of the liver 
even after the disappearance of the primary cause of 
liver injury. 
Clinical Features 
Cirrhosis of liver may progress for years before any 
clinical suspicion is aroused because even 10% of 
healthy liver tissue is adequate for metabolic functions 
and liver tissue has a remarkable capacity to regenerate. 
The presenting features of cirrhosis are ascites, edema, 
hematemesis or hepatic coma. The clinical features can 
be classified as those due to liver cell failure and those 
due to portal hypertension. 
I.Due to Liver cell failure:
1.Palmar erythema, spider nevi
2.Gynecomastia, testicular atrophy and loss
of libido
3.Jaundice -usually mild, may be severe
terminally
4.Ascites, edema and scrotal swelling
5.Flapping tremors

10. Fats and carbohydrates as much as the patient
tolerates. Salt is restricted if edema or ascites
is present. Supplemental Vitamin B complex
should be given.
Diuretics: Spirono/actone is an aldosterone
antagonist that antagonizes the effects of
excess aldosterone present in cirrhotics due to
inadequate elimination of aldosterone by liver.
100 mg/day may be given. Maximum dose 400
mg. Frusemide can also be added up to 80mg.
Removal of cause: Withdrawal of alcohol,
D-penicillamine for Wilson's disease, etc.
Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants may be 
helpful in active post-hepatitis cirrhosis. 
Antifibrotic agents like colchicine and 
propylthiouracil are still experimental. 
Interferon's utility is limited once cirrhosis sets in. 
It is useful only if there is actively replicating virus 
B or C and patient is awaiting transplant

9 Portal Hypertension 
Definition : Portal Hypertension is defined by a 
pathologic increasse in portal pressure above the up­
per limit of 5 mm Hg. 
Portal HT becomes clinically significant when the 
portal pressure increases above the threshold value 
of 10 mm Hg (eg. formation ofvarices) or 12 mm Hg 
(e.g variceal bleeding, ascites). Portal pressure values 
between 6 and 10 mm Hg represent subclinical portal 
hypertension. 
Portal HT is the most common & lethal complica 
tion of chronic liver disease. [t is responsible for the 
development of gastroesophageal varices and portal 
hypertensive gastropathy, variceal hemorrhage, ascites, 

{ 3) Abdomen 
renal dysfunction, portosystemic encephalopathy,
hypersplenism & hepatopulmonary syndrome.
Toe portal vein -systemic collateral circulation devel­
ops & expands in response to elevation of the portal
pressure. The main sites of collatteral formation are : 
1.Gastro-esophageal junction,
2. 
3. 
4. Rectum,
Retroperitoneum and
Anterior abdominal wall via the umbilical vein
(caput medusae).
Causes 
J.Pre-hepatic:
1.Portal vein thrombosis
2.Splenic venin thrombosis

Treatment 
L Treatment of cause: If the underlying cause can 
be identified, it should be treated. 
II.Treatment ofVariceal bleeding:
A.LocalNleasures
L Sclerotherapy: Sclerosing agents like
sodium tetradecyi sulphate and 3% 
phenol in water are injected through 
upper GI endoscop y, around the 
varices. They obliterate the blood 
vessels and prevent future bleeds. It 
stops variceal bleed in 80% of patients 
and can be repeated ifbleeding recurs. 
However, if there is active bleeding, 
sclerotherapy is hazardous and first 
the bleeding should be controlled by 
balloon tamponade. 
2.Banding: This is a technique to
stop 
variceal bleeding in which the
varices are sucked into an endoscope

86 accessory, allowing them to be 
ocduded with a tight rubber band. 
The occluded vari subsequently 
sloughs with variceal obliteration. 
However it is less easy to apply in 
acute bleeding. 
3.Balloon tamponade: This is done with
Sengstake n-Blakemore tube which
possesses two balloons and exerts
pressure in the lower esophagus and
fundus of the stomach. The tube is
passed through the mouth and its
presence in the stomach is checked by
auscultating over the upper abdomen
while injecting air into the stomach.
Gentle traction is used to maintain
pressure on the varices. Initially only
the gastric balloon is inflated, which
would control the bleeding. If the
esophageal balloon is also inflated,
it is important to deflate it for l 0
mins every three hours to prevent
esophageal mucosa! damage. This
usually stops the variceal bleed, but
only allows for time for more definite
therapy.
4.Shunt surgery: Portocaval shunts
also give excellent results with low
morbidity and mortality and is a one
time procedure unlike sclerotherapy
which may have to be repeated.
However, the incidence of hepatic
encephalopathy is high and death
could result from liver failure. Hence
it is only used when other measures
fail and offered only to patients with
good liver functions.
B.Drugs: Splanchnic flow can be reduced by
vasopressin, somatostatin ( octreotide) and
terlipressin.
1.Vasopressin: ltisgivenasanIVinfusion,
0.4 units per min. until bleeding stops
or for 24 hours and then 0.2 units per
min. for a further 24 hours. It can
cause angina, myocardial infarction
and arrhythmia s. Nitroglycerine
transdermally or IV should be usedPRACTICAL MEDICINE 
to combat this. ECG monitoring is 
necessary. 
2.Somatostatin and Octreotide, a
synthetic form of somatostatin
is given in the dose of 50 mcg IV
followed by an infusion of 50 mcg
hourly. It is an expensive drug, but
the drug of choice.
3.Terlipressin: It is not an active drug,
but vasopressin is released from it in
sufficient amounts to reduce portal
pressure without producing systemic
side effects. It is given in the dose of
2 mg IV every 6 hours until bleeding
stops and then 1 mg IV for further 24
hours.
C.Prophylaxis
In patients with variceal bleed, recurrent
bleeding is very common. This could be
prevented by regularsclerotherapy, banding
or drugs like beta-blockers or nitrates.
Propranolol 80-160 mg/day reduces portal
venous pressure and can be used to prevent
recurrent variceal bleed. Beta-blockers
are now routinely used in prophylaxis.
However, they carry a theoretical risk of
increasing the hepatic blood flow and
thus hepatic encephalopathy. Nitrates are
second line agents used in patients who are
intolerance to beta blockers.
D.TIPS (Transjugular Intrahepatic Portal
Shunt) used for patients awaiting liver
transplant.
E.Liver Transplant
III.Treatment of Enlarged Spleen:
Massive splenomega ly, hypersplenism and
splenic infarction may require splenectomy and
shunt surgery.
IV.Treatment of Ascites:
Salt restricted diet with diuretics spironolactone
and of furosemide.
Massive ascites requires therapeutic tapping.

Chronic Heaptitis C 
HCV infection is a leading cause of morbidity 
and mortality with a global prevalence of 3%. 
Natural history 
Diagnosis 
I.Detectable anti -HCV indicate exposure but
does not confirm active infection, because anti·
HCV persistent indefintely after spontaneous or
therapeutic resolution
2.HCV RNA viral load should be performed in
all patients with positive anti-HCV assay & in
patients in whom antivrial treament is being
considered.
3.HCV genotype - 6 major genotypes (I to 6)
Treatment 
l.Standard therapy consists of combination of
pegylated interferon (PEG IFN) and Ribavarin
2.Sustained 
virolgical response (SVR) i.e. HCV
RNA negative 24 weeks after end of treatment
is achieved in 45-80% of patients depending on
the genotype.
Future 
Protease inhibitors such as Boceprevir and Telaprevir 
and Polymerase inhibitors such as safosuvir combined 
with Ribavarin with or without PEG IFN will 
further enhance treatment response and minimise the emer­
gence of viral resistance. 
Wilson's Disease 
•Wilson disease is a 
genetic disorders ( autosomal
recessive) in which copper accumulates in the
liver & brain is excess of normal metabolic needs.
•Diagnosis : i) Low levels 
of serum cerruloplasmin
i.e. less than 20 mg/ di (Normal: 20-50 mg/ di);
ii) Hepatic copper concentration above 250 µg
/ g. dry copper wt.; iii) clinical findings include
presence of kayser fleischer rings, stigmata of
chronic liver disease & neurologic findings.
Treatment is life long 
i.Chelating agentseg. D-penicillamine, Trientene
ii.Zinc salts
iii.Liver transplantation for acute liver failure or
decompensate liver disease.
10 > Alcoholic Liver Disease 
(ALO) 
Alcohol induced liver injury 
results from chronic 
alcoholic ingestion which may be classified as : 
I.Alcoholic fatty liver (AF)
2.Alcoholic hepatitis (AH)
3.Alcoholic cirrhosis ofliver (AC)
Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) Acetaldehyde 
Dehy­
drogenese (ALDH) Co2 Alcohol Acetaldehyde + H2o 
Oriental flush syndrome : Results from impaired 
metabolism of acetaldehyde caused by inheritance of 
the ALDH22 allele seen mainly in persosn from East 
Asia (eg. Japan) causing toxic systemic effects such 
as nausea, headache, flushing & tachycardia of acet­
aldehyde accumulation. Therefore, tense patients get 
symptom of excessive flushing after consuming alcohol.

Risk factors of ALD 
1.Quantity : Risk of developing cirrhosis with
ingestion of>60-80 g 
/ day of alcohol in men &
>20 g/day in women for 10 years or longer.
2.Gender : Increased susceptibility to ALD at
amounts> 20 g/day (2 units) [ 
l unit= 10 gm].
3.Hepatitis C 
: Concurrent HCV infection
associated with younger age for severity, more
advanced histology and decreased survival.
4.Genetics: Gene polymorphisms include alcohol
dehydrogenase (ADH) and 
the cytochrome P450
system (CYP4502El).
S.Malnutrition 
: Nutritional status important risk
factor for the development of ALD & diet.
Pathogenesis 
The mechanism whereby alcohol produces different 
liver lesions is poorly understood. Fatty change may 
be due to increased production and decreased use of 
fatty acids in the liver cells following the conversion 
of alcohol to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase. 
For the development of alcoholic hepatitis, fibrosis and 
cirrhosis, production of toxic metabolites called ad­
ducts during the conversion of acetaldehyde to acetate 
may be responsible. In addition, 
immune reaction to 
liver cells altered by alcohol may also be involved. 
Determinants of liver injury are : PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
Alcoholic Fatty Liver (AF} 
AF occurs in most heavy drinker but is reversible on 
cessation of alcohol consumption. 
Pathology: The liver is enlarged, greasy, yellow and 
firm. Hepatocytes are distended with fatty vacuoles 
which push the nucleus to the periphery. This occurs 
because fatty acid oxidation is impaired and they are 
taken up by the cells and esteri fied to form triglycerides. 
Clinical features: The clinical features are minimum 
or absent. There may be tender hepatomegaly only. 
Investigations: Usually all laboratory tests are normal. 
Sometimes there may be elevation ofSGOT and alka 
line phosphatase. 
Prognosis: AF has good prognosis. Complete resolu­
tion occurs after cessation of alcohol intake. 
Treatment: Alcohol intake must be stopped. Nutri­
tious diet with high doses of vitamin B complex must 
be given. 
Alcoholic Hepatitis (AH) 
AH is an inflammatory lesion characterized by infil­
tration of the liver with leucocytes, liver cell necrosis 
and alcoholic hyaline deposition. 
Pathology: Liver cells are ballooned, degenerated 
and necrosed with infiltration with polymorphs and 
lymphocytes. Hepatocytes contain Mallory bodies or 
alcoholic hyaline which are clumps of perinuclear, 
deeplyeosinophilic material that represents intermedi­
ate filaments. Mallory bodies are not diagnostic but do 
usually suggest alcoholic hepatitis. They are also seen 
with morbid obesity, jejuno-ileal shunt, uncontrolled 
diabetes mellitus, Wilson's disease, Indian childhood 
cirrhosis, etc. 
Clinical Features: This varies from asymptomatic 
patient to mild illness to fatal liver cell failure. 
Typically it resembles Viral hepatitis 
1.Anorexia, 
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,
malaise, weight loss and jaundice
2.Fever as high as 39 · 40qC may be seen in SO%
of cases
3.Tender hepatomegaly is usually present.
Splenomegaly occurs in 33% cases
4.Signs of liver cell failure like spider angioma,
jaundice, ascites, edema, GI bleeding and
encephalopathy may be present
5.Cholestatic jaundice may occur in some

( 3 > Abdomen 
Most of the patient recover after several weeks to 
months after abstinence, however, histological ab­
normalities may persist for 6 months. 
Investigations 
1.Anemia may occur from GI bleeding, nutritional
deficiency (folate and B12 deficiency), hyper­
splenism, direct bone marrow suppressant effect
of alcohol and hemolysis due to acanthocytosis.
2.Leucocytosis is usually present. However,
leucopenia and thrombocytopenia could occur
due to hypersplenism.
3.Alkaline phosphatase may be elevated.
4.SGOT is high but rarely more than 300 units.
Unlike in viral hepatitis where SGPT is higher
compared to SGOT, in alcoholic hepatitis SGOT
is much higher than SGPT. This is because of
greater inhibition of SG PT synthesis by ethanol
which may be partially 
reversed by pyridoxal
phosphate.
5.Serum prothrombin is prolonged due to reduced
synthesis of Vitamin K dependent dotting
factors.
6.Serum albumin is usually reduced due to
impairment in hepatic protein synthesis. Globulins
are high due to non-specific stimulation of
reticuloendothelial system. Hyperbilirubinemia
may be present, due to decompensation.
7.Hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia may
occur due to dietary deficiency. Hypokalemia may
occur due to hyperaldosteronism (aldosterone
is normally destroyed in liver).
8.Gamma Glutamyl Transpeptidase (GGPT) is
raised due to alcoholic abuse irrespective ofliver
disease due to microsomal enzyme induction.
Prognosis 
In milder cases, clinical recovery can occur completely. 
However, repeated bouts of alcoholic hepatitis may lead 
to irreversible progressive liver injury, abstinence from 
alcohol can reduce long term morbidity and mortality. 
Marked hyperbilirubinemia, elevated creatinine, 
elevated prothrombin time (more than 1-5 times 
normal), ascites and encephalopathy are associated 
with poor short term prognosis. Prognosis 
3 models shown to predict short term prognostic 
in Alcoholic hepatitis. 
l.Discriminant function (DF) (Maddrey's score):
[ 4.6 x (patients prothrombin time -control
value in seconds)] + S. bilibrubin (mg/di). DF
value<'. 32 has a poor prognosis with 1 month
mortality rates of 35-45%.
2.Mode/for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD): It
includes S. bilirubin level, INR & S. Creatinine
levels. A score of<'. 21 is highly predictive of
90 day mortality.
3.Glassgow Alcoholic Hepatitis Scale (GAHS)
: It includes S. bilirubin, INR, BUN, Age &
WBC count. A score of <'. 9 at days l & 7 is
suggestive of severe alcoholic hepatitis & a
poor prognosis.
Alcoholic Cirrhosis of Liver (AC) 
AC is diffuse fine scaring with loss of liver cells and 
small regenerating nodules (micronodular) 
Pathology: With continued alcohol intake, liver cells 
are destroyed and fibroblasts appear at the site of 
injury and stimulate collagen formation. Septae of 
connective tissue appear in the periportal and peri­
central zones which eventually connects portal triad 
and central vein. The remaining liver cells which are 
surrounded by connective tissue, regenerate and form 
nodules. Usually, cell loss exceeds regeneration. The 
liver shrinks and becomes hard and nodular

90 Clinical Features: It is usually silent in 10% of cases. 
The clinical manifestations are like cirrhosis of liver. 
Dupuytren's contracturedue to fibrosis of pal mar fascia 
with resulting flexion contracture of the digits and 
parotid swelling are associated with alcoholism rather 
than cirrhosis. 
Laboratory Tests: Similar to alcoholic hepatitis. El 
evated blood ammonia may also occur due to impaired 
liver function and shunting of portal venous blood 
around the cirrhotic liver. 
Prognosis: Similar to alcoholic hepatitis 
Treatment: Similar to cirrhosis of liver 
11 > Malaria 
Malaria is a common tropical disease caused by a 
protozoa, plasmodium, through the bite of female 
anopheles mosquito. 
Types 
There are mainly four types of plasmodium infection 
causing malaria as follows: 
I.Plasmodium falciparum (Malignant tertian
malaria)
2. 
3. 
4. Plasmodium vivax (Benign tertian malaria)
Plasmodium malariae (Quartan malaria)
Plasmodium ovate
Life Cycle (Fig. 3.30) 
When an infected mosquito bites an individual, its 
saliva, rich in parasites (sporozoites) is injected. The 
sporozoites enter he circulation and then the liver 
(pre-erythrocytic phase). It multiplies in the liver 
cells forming merozoites. After 5-9 days, the mero 
zoites enter the red blood cells (erythrocytic phase) 
forming trophozoites which subsequently mature to 
become schizonts. The schizonts are discharged int.o 
the blood stream when the red cells degenerate. This 
results in an attack of malarial fever. The red cells are 
destroyed by the spleen which enlarges and some of 
the schizonts continue to develop in the liver (exo­
erythrocytic phase) causing a relapse. This phase is 
absent in falciparum malaria. 
Some of the merozoites for unknown reasons do not PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
form schizonts but develop into male and female gam­
etes. During the mosquito bite, these gametocytes are 
ingested. They fertilize in the mosquito's stomach and 
develop into sporozoites which localize in the salivary 
glands of the mosquito. These sporozoites enter the 
human blood stream on a subsequent mosquito bite 
and thus complete the cycle. 
Clinical Features 
1.Onset: The onset may be insidious with
abdominal pain, nausea, dry cough and malaise.
Rarely it may be acute and with fever and chills.
2.Fever with rigors: In the early stage, fever may
be persistent for several days but soon it develops
into a synchronous periodicity. A classical attack
offever has a chill, rise in temperature to 40-41 °C,
headache and myalgia. This is followed by several
hours of profuse sweating and fall in temperature.
In vivax and oval malaria these paroxysms occur
every 48 hours (benign tertian) whereas in
malaria, it occurs every 72 hours (quartan). In
falciparum malaria, the temperature is usually
persistently elevated or may progress to 48 hour
cycle (malignant tertian malaria). These cycles
may be repeated in case of benign tertian malaria
due to exo-erythrocytic phase.
3.Organomegaly: Liver is moderately enlarged and
tender. Spleen is often palpable in acute attack. It
is soft to firm and occasionally tender.
4.Miscellaneous: Herpes simplex lesions may be
present around the mouth. Rarely jaundice may
occur.
Investigations 
1.Complete Blood Count and Demonstration of
parasites: There is normochromic normocyti c
anemia. Both thick and thin smears should be
examined for detection and identification of the
malarial parasites. Blood smears must be repeated
at intervals of 6 12 hours on multiple occasions.
Malarial parasites can also be demonstrated
on bone marrow examination and by splenic
puncture.
Criteria for severe falciparum malaria:
a.More than 5% of RBCs infected
b.Parasites index more than 1,00,000/ul

( 3 > Abdomen 
c.More than 250 parasites per field on thick
smear
d.Leucocytosis
2.Serology: Henry's melanin flocculation test,
complement fixation test, passive hemaglutina­
tion test, gel precipitation test and immuno­
fluorescent technique to demonstrate antibodies
to malarial parasite are useful.
3.Otherinvestigations: Serum electrolytes, BUN,
creatinine, blood sugar, ECG, chest X -ray, arterial
blood gases, blood culture, lumbar puncture if
necessary.
4.Newer Methods: Polymerase Chain Reaction
(PCR) and serological tests based on histidine
rich protein 2 (HRP-2) (e.g. Parasite F and ICT
Ff) and pLDH (e.g. Optimal).
Complications 
1.Cerebral malaria: This is an altered state
of consciousness due to the presence of Pl.
falciparum. Patient usually has fever and non­
specific symptoms for a few days before the
development of cerebral malaria. There may be
mild neck rigidity and retinal hemorrhages but no
white exudates or papilledema. Deep reflexes are
brisk and plantarsextensor with absent abdominal
reflexes. Psychiatric manifestations, convulsions
and coma may occur. Rarely brainstem may be
involved, manifested by convergence spasm,
ocular bobbing and nystagmus. Cerebellar
ataxia, may occur. Rare manifestations are
cranial nerve palsy, extrapyramidal syndromes,
polyneuropa thy, mononeuritis multiplex, Guillain
Barre-syndrome and rhabdomyolysis.
2.Algid malaria (shock): There may be subnormal
temperature, weakness, prostration, feeling of
cold, vomiting, rapid respiration and oliguria.
Death may occur but the patient is conscious
till the end. It could be due to adrenal crisis,
absorption of endotoxin from gut or cachectin­
tumour necrosis factor from endotoxin activated
macrophages.
3.Hematological abnormalities:
a.Normochromic anemia may occur due
to hemolysis, inappropriate bone marrow
response and increased sequestration and
destruction in the spleen.b.Leucocytes are usually normal. However,
leucocytosis without infection may occur
due to cachectin (tumour necrosis factor)
and carries grave prognosis.
c.Thrombocytopenia may be due to decreased
platelet productio n, decreased platelet
survival, increased splenic uptake and
sequestration and consumption by DIC.
d.Bleeding may occur due to DIC.
4.Renal failure: (defined as urine output
<400ml/24 hours and failure to improve after
rehydration). The patient may present with loin
pain, vomiting, diarrhea, polyuria followed by
oliguria with passage of dark or black urine, with
or without fever, tender hepato-splenomegaly,
anemia, jaundice, hypotension, renal failure and
coma. Acute glomerulonephritis and nephrotic
syndrome may also occur. lntravascular
hemolysis, hypovolemia, hyperviscosity and
intravascular coagulatio n may be responsible
for renal failure.
Blackwater fever is a condition where renal
failure is associated with severe intravascular
hemolysis and hemoglobinuria. If the patient
survives acute phase, urination commences in
4 days and increased creatinine levels return to
normal in 3-4 weeks.
5.Pulmonary edema: This occurs due to

94 increased capillary permeability due to effects 
of endotoxins and cytokines. Hyperparasitemia, 
renal failure and pregnancy are predisposing 
factors. It occurs suddenly after 1-2 days of 
starting treatment with increased respiratory 
rate, breathlessness, hemoptysis and collapse. 
It carries high mortality. 
6.Lactic acidosis: Parasitized red cells interfere
with micro circulatory flow leading to anaerobic
glycolysis in tissues. This with hypotension and
inadequate hepatic lactate clearance causes
lactic acidosis, which is characterized by
hyperventilation and circulatory failure resistant
to volume expansion and inotropic agents.
Prognosis is very poor.
7.Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting and
diarrhea with or without blood and pus may
occur. Endotoxin that is absorbed from the gut
results in cyto adherence of parasitized red cells
in the blood vessels of villi leading to ischemic
damage of the epithelium. There may be failure
of normal hepatic clearance mechanism. Rarely
pancreatitis occurs.
8.Hypoglycemia: This occurs due to quinine and
quinidine, which stimulates pancreatic insulin
secretion. There is also increase in glucose
consumption by host and parasite, glycogen
depletion and decreased gluconeogenesis.
Pregnancy predisposes to hypoglycemia.
9.Other infections: Malaria has immuno­
depressant action resulting in high incidence
of infectious diseases.
10.Other complications: Prostration, jaundice,
orthostatic hypotension, aspiration pneumonia.

1.Fluid deficit assessment and correction
2.Fever control
3.Convulsion treatment
n.Specific Treatment
A.Treatment of Chloroquine-susceptible
P.vivax, P. falciparum, P. ovale, P. malariae
Chloroquine: This is given in the dose of
600 mg (base) followed by 300 mg at 6, 24
and 48 hours. (In children IO mg/kg ofbase
as loading dose and 5 mg/kg subsequently).
This is useful to treat acute attack of all types
of malaria. It is curative for PI. falciparum
malaria, but cannot prevent relapses due to
exo-erythrocytic cycles of Pl. vivax malaria.
It can be given intravenously 600 mg diluted
and given slowly followed by 900 mg over
the next 24 hours.
Drug resistance: In vivo, the response to 
chloroquine treatment, given as 1.5 g base 
or 2.5 g salt over 3 days, is graded as below: 
S: Susceptible (Produces a cure) 
RI: Low-level resistance (clearance of parasitemia 
followed by recrudescence within 28 days) 
RH: Intermediate-level resistance (Decrease in parasitemia 
with parasite cleara nee from blood) 
RIii: High-level resistance (No detectable decrease or an 
increase in parasitemia) 
B.Treatment of Chloroquine-Resistant P.
falciparum
1.Quinidine is preferable to quinine
for parenteral use. It is given IV,
the loading dose being lOmg/kg
dissolved in 300 ml normal saline
infused over 1-2 hours. This is
followed by constant infusion at 0.02
mg/kg/min till oral therapy with
quinine can be given.
2.Quinine hydrochloride: 600 mg tds 
for 3-7 days is useful. This drug can 
be given intravenously if required for 

( 3 > Abdomen 
cerebral malaria. The dose is 7 mg/kg 
over 30 min followed by 10 mg/kg 
over 4 hours and then 10 mg/kg over 8 
hours or until the patient can complete 
7 days of oral treatment. Doxycycline 
should also be simultaneously given 
in the dose of 100-200 mg/day. 
3.Mefloquine: It has a rapid
schizonticidal action in the single
dose of 15 mg/kg orally maximum
dose 1000-1250 mg. It may cause
nausea, vertigo, light-headedness,
confusion, psychosis and fits.
4.Halofantrine: This is effective in some
parts of Africa against P. falciparum.
It is given in the dose of 500 mg every
6 hours for 3 doses. [n children the
dose is 8 mg/kg.
5.Qinghaosu: This is discovered from
herbs by Chinese and is effective
for P. falciparum. Artemisinin
derivatives are rapidly acting, safe and 
effective against multi-drug resistant
infections. Artemether 3.2 mg/kg IM
is given followed by 1.6 mg/kg [M 
every 12-24 hours until patient wakes 
up. 
Artesunate 2 mg/kg I. V. stat followed
by I mg/kg 12 hourly.
Orally -100 mg B.D. Day I followed
by 50 mg B.D. Days 2-5.
6. Pyrimethamine and sulfadoxime:
A combination of pyrimethamine 25
mg and sulfadoxime 1500 mg helps
to cure an acute attack of chloroquine
resistant malaria.
7.Exchange transfusion: This is given
for very high parasitemia ( > 10%) and
altered mental state.
8.Ketoconazole, miconazol e and
liposomal amphotericin B have
been also found effective in refractory
cases.
C.Treatment of Chloroquine-resistant P. vivax:
Oral metloquine or halofantrineD.Treatment of Persistent Hypnozoites in
P.vivax or P. ovale Infections
1.Primaquine: This should be given
in the dose of7.5 mg BD for 14 days
usually after doing a G6PD test. This
has no effect on acute attack.
2.Bulaquine is given 25 mg OD for 5
days.
III.Treatment of Complications
IV.Prophylaxis
1.Measures should be taken to prevent
mosquito breeding e.g. proper sewage
drainage, and preventing stagnation of
water. Spreading oil over the water helps
to kill the larva.
2.Protective measures should be taken by 
persons staying in endemic areas. This
includes sleeping under mosquito net and
wearing protective clothing.
3.Travelers to endemic areas must take
prophylaxis as given in Table below.

12 > Kala Azar 
Kala azar is caused by Leishmania Donovani. It is 
endemic in India in Bihar, Bengal, Assam, Orissa, 
UP and Madras. 
95 

96 The parasite occurs in two forms -amastigote (leishman­
ial) stage in man or other vertebrates ( dog, hamster, etc.) 
and promastigote (leptomonad) stage in sandfly. The 
amastigote form is a round or oval body, with thin cell 
membrane, round or oval nucleus with kinetoplast (DNA 
containing body and mitochondria) at right angles to the 
nucleus, a thin axoneme from kinetoplast to the margin 
of the body and a vacuole. 
The promastigote form is found in sandfly and on 
culture medium. It consists of long slender spindle PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
shaped bodies with a central nucleus, eosinophilic 
vacuole, and a flagellum. 
Life Cycle (Fig. 3.35) 
The sandfly bites the infected man and ingests along 
with blood parasites. The amastigote is transformed 
to promastigote in the stomach of the vector in 5-7 
days. The promastigote multiples and is transformed 
during the next blood meal to another man. 
The parasites are taken by the phagocytes and they

multiply within them by binary fission. The macro 
phages filled with the parasites rupture releasing the 
parasites in circulation which are taken by the cells of 
reticuloendothelial system. This leads to enlargement 
of spleen and liver . Gamma globulins particularly 
JgG is increased but the antibodies present are not 
protective. 
Immunology 
Amastigote excites a cellular reaction of histiocyte 
proliferation followed by invasion of lymphocytes 
and plasma cells by the parasites. The sensitized lym­
phocytes destroy Leishmania-filled macrophages. The 
increased IgG are responsible for formal gel reaction. 
Similarly specific antibodies (complement fixing, 
hemagglutinating and fluorescent) can be used for 
diagnostic purposes. 
Clinical Features 
Incubation period varies from few days to few years 
average 3-6 months. 
l.Pyrexia: This may be continuous, remittent or
later intermittent. The fever may be preceded
by rigor or vomiting, but is not associated with
headache, prostration or sweating. In 20% cases
there may be two spikes of temperature within
24 hours (camel hump fever).
2.Splenomegaly: TI1ere is progressive enlargement
of the spleen which may extend upto the right
iliac fossa. Spleen increases in size with each
episode of fever.
3. Hepatomegaly and Lymphadenopathy: Liver
enlargement follows splenomegaly. Usually
lymph nodes are not enlarged, but in African
and Chinese form they may be enlarged.
4.Skin: The skin is dry, rough, harsh and
hyperpigmented. Hair is brittle and sparse. Post.
kala azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) occurs
one year or several years after recovery. They may
develop in three forms -depigmented macular
lesion like tinea versicolor, erythematous papules
or erythematous nodules on ear and face (like
nodules of leprosy) All the three types may be
present in the same patient.
5.Systemic features : Unlike in other fevers there
is no apathy, malaise or anorexia. However thepatient may be emaciated and anemic with 
wasting, edema, hemorrhagic manifestations, 
diarrhea (GI involvement) and cough (due to 
lung involvement). 
Complications 
1.Respiratory: Pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis
2. Gastrointestinal: Amebic and bacillary dysentery
3.Cancrum oris: Ulcerative lesion near the angle
of the mouth
4.Septic infection
5.Pancytopenia
Diagnosis 
I.Direct Evidence:
Parasites may be demonstrated by microscopic
examination of stained film or by culture
examination.
a.Microscopic examination: Blood, bone
marrow or splenic aspirate can be examined
under the microscope. The amastigotes
within the macrophages are referral to as
LD bodies (Leishman-Donovan bodies).
ln1racellular 
1 leishmania
(LO bodies] 
Fig. 3.36: Le1shmania-D0novan (LD) bodies 1n monocytes 
in Kala-azar 
b.Culture: About 1-2 ml. of blood, marrow
or splenic aspirate is cultured in NMN
(Navy, MacNeal and Nicolle) medium
which consists of 2 parts of salt agar and
one part of defibrinated rabbit's blood. The
material for culture is inoculated into the
water of condensation of the medium and
incubated at 22-24°C for 1-4 weeks. At the
end of each week, a drop of condensation
fluid is examined for promastigote . This is
97 

98 a slow method and may take one month to 
make .a diagnosis 
II.Indirect Evidence:
A.Blood 
Count: There is pancytopenia,
but leucocytes are reduced more than
erythrocytes. Eosinophils are usually
absent.
B.Serological Tests
l.Napiers aldehyde test: One ml of serum
is taken and to it a drop or two of 40%
formalde-hyde is added. Jellification
of milk white opacity within 2-20
minutes occurs if Kala-azar 
is of over
3 months duration due to increased
gamma globulins. This test is also
positive in myeloma, 
cirrhosis of
liver, S Japonicum and African
trypanosomiasis. However it is
negative in cutaneous leishmaniasis.
2.Chopra's Antimony test: 4% urea
stibamine solution is added to I
in 10 dilution of serum in distilled
water. Flocculationsoccur in positive
cases.
3.Brahmachari's test: To I ml of serum,
distilled water is added. In positive
cases a precipitate forms.
4.Complement fixation 
test: This is done
with Witebsky. Klingenstein and
Kuhn (WKK) antigen and becomes
positive in 3 weeks. However, it is not
specific, being positive in tuberculosis,
leprosy and trypanosomiasis.
5.Other serological tests: Indirect
immuno-fluorescence and enzyme
linked immuno -sorbent assay
(ELISA) have also been found to be
sensitive.
Treatment 
l.Sodium antimony gluconate: One ml contains I 00
mg of antimony. Daily 6 ml is given IM or IV for
10-15 days. In children 3 ml daily is given and
in infants 2 ml daily is given. The course could
be repeated after a gap of 15 days.PRACTICAL 
MEDICINE 
2.Pentamidine 
isethionate: It is given in the dose
of 3-4 mg/kg. daily or on alternate days for
15 injections. Hypotension due to histamine
release may occur. This is prevented by giving
antihistaminics 20-30 minutes before each
injection. It may also cause liver and kidney
damage as well as precipitate diabetes mellitus.
3.Amphotericin B: In resistant cases of Kala azar
it is given in the dose of 0.1-0.25 mg/kg in 5%
dextrose slowly on alternate days 3-8 weeks.
Prevention 
I.Personal: Using mosquito 
nets (22 meshes/inch)
fumigation of sleeping quarters and avoiding
sleeping on ground floor would help.
2.Community: Man is the reservoir of infection
and treating all cases of Kala azar would help,
Measures 
against eradication of sandflies would
also be useful.
13 Typhoid 
Definition 
Typhoid is an infectious disease caused by salmonella 
typhi which is a gram negative, non-spore forming 
bacilli. 
Epidemiology 
Typhoid germs are contracted from food or drink con. 
taminated with excreta from carriers or patients. The 
spread is facilitated by poor environmental hygiene. 
Immunity following the infection is not sufficient to 
prevent relapse. 
Predisposing Factors 
1.Organism: A large number of organisms have
to be ingested by healthy person to suffer from
typhoid. 
Smaller inocula may produce the
disease if the organisms are very virulent or if
the resistance of the host is poor.
2.Stomach 
acidity: The acid in stomach destroys
salmonella that is ingested. Hence, patients
having achlorhydria (no acid in stomach) or who
take large amounts of antacids to neutralize the
acid in stomach suffer more often from typhoid.
-_ ......... 

b ( 3 Abdomen 
3.Intestinal flora: The normal intestinal flora
produces short chain fatty acids which are
lethal to salmonella. When these are reduced by
antibiotics, the patient is more prone to typhoid.
Pathophysiology 
Salmonella that cause enterocolitis after ingestion, 
invade the mucosal cells and multiply within them. 
lnjestion 
Proliferation in 
small bowel ---------11.EThey do not penetrate beyond lamina propria and 
multiply in the lymphoid tissues (Peyer's patches) of 
the small intestine. Inflammatory changes occur with 
accumulation ofleucocytes. Enterotoxin liberated by 
the bacteria may form abscess, which may burst causing 
ovoid ulcers. This may cause hemorrhage and if the 
ulcer reaches the serosa, perforation occurs.

99 

Clinical Features 
I.Enterocolitis: In enteroco\itis, 
the infection
is usually localized in the small intestines and
colon. The incubation period is usually 12 -72
hours but may be up to 2 weeks.
l.Nausea, vomiting and an early chill are
common initially followed by colicky
abdominal pain and diarrhea of watery,
green, offensive stools.
2.Blood mixed with stool and high fever may
occur if there is involvement of colon.
Symptoms may subside within a week or
two.
II.Enteric Fever: This is clinical syndrome
characterized by fever, headache, prostration,
cough, splenomegaly and leucopenia, caused
by S. typhi or paratyphi. The incubation period
is 7 
14 days. The onset is insidious with the
following features:
l.Fever: Usually, there is a continuous fever,
which typically rises in the stepladder
pattern in the first week, but it may be
remittent type. 
Rigors and sweats are not
common. It is usually accompanied by dull
headache.
2.Abdomen: Mild abdominal discomfort and
distension occurs 
with nausea, vomiting
and 
constipation, which are followed by
diarrhea (pea 
soup stools). Hepatomegaly
and splenomegaly occurs.
3.Rose-spots: These are erythematous,
maculopapular lesions 2 
4 mm in diameter
which 
blanch on pressure usually seen on
the upper abdomen, back and chest. They
occur in the first or second week.
4.Miscellaneous: Cough due to 'typhoid
bronchitis' and relative bradycardia may
occur.
Ill. Clinical course: ln the pre-antibiotic 
era, 
the patient gradually recovered or developed 
complications in the third or fourth week. 
Relapse occurs in 5-10% of untreated patients 
and 15-20% of patients on treatment. 
Chronic Carrier State 
Chronic carriers are those who excrete salmonella 
100 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
organism in their feces for at least one year. Usu­
ally they are typhoid patients or persons with biliary 
tract disease. 'Ihe gall bladder serves as a reservoir 
of infection and this carrier state is asymptomatic. It 
may persist for lifetime without antibiotics or biliary 
tract surgery. Rarely, urinary carriers may be present. 
Investigations 
l.Culture: Salmonella organisms can be
grown from blood culture or dot culture on
MacConkey's agar in the first 
week in 90% of
patient. In the second week, stool culture is more
reliable. The organism can also be isolated in
some cases from urine.
2.Serology: Widal test determines the agglutinins
against somatic (O) and flagellar (H) antigens.
1his test is negative in the first week, becomes
positive by second or third week and may remain
positive for a prolonged period. Hence, a single
positive test is of no diagnostic value, but a
demonstration of a rising titer in a patient of
fever is suggestive of typhoid fever.
3.Leucopenia: is usually present except in presence
of complications or in children.
Complications 
I.Abdominal
l.Hemorrhage may occur at the end of
the second week and is characterized by
black stools, tachycardia, hypotension and
diarrhea. There is no abdominal pain or
rigidity or obliteration ofliver dullness like
in intestinal perforation . Transfusions may
be needed if there is massive blood loss.
2.Perforation may occur at the end of the
second 
week or in the third week. It is
characterized by acute pain in the lower
abdomen, vomiting, abdominal distension,
hypotension and tachycardia. 'Ihe liver
dullness may be obliterated and the
abdomen becomes tender, rigid and silent
(absent peristalsis).

(picking up clothes in bed) and subsultus
tendinosis
8.Psychosis
Treatment 
I.ENTEROCOLITIS:Th isisaself limiting disease
which requires only symptomatic treatment like
fluid and electrolyte balance ant iperistaltic agents
etc. Antibiotics are used only if there is impaired
host resistance.
II.Enteric Fever:
A.General Measures:
l.Rest: Patients with enteric fever
must be given complete bedrest and
preferably hospitalized because the
incidence of complications is more in
patients who have not taken adequate
rest.
2.Diet: For the first dew days a semi­
solid diet is advised and later a
low-roughage, high-calorie diet like
bananas is ad vised. This is to decrease
the intestinal content in presence of
friable intestines.
3.Nursing care: The general care of the
patient includes good nursing and
disinfection of excreta and bed linen
in 2% Lysol. Fluid and electrolyte
balance and vital signs must beregularly observed to detect any 
serious complications. 
4.Antipyretics: Fever and body ache can
be treated with paracetamol and tepid
sponging.
B.Antibiotics
I.Conventional: Oral or IV
ch/oramphenicol 500 mg 6 hourly
in the first week followed by 500
mg 8 hourly for 2 more weeks. Co
trimoxazole 2 tablets TDS, A111oxycilli11
I gm 6 hourly or Ampicillin 500 mg 6
hourly are other useful drugs.
2.Quinolones: Ciprofloxacin 200 mg IV
8-12 hourly in a drip has been found
to be very useful in chloramphenicol
resistant typhoid fever, If the patient
is not vomiting it can be given orally
in the dose of 500 mg 8-12 hourly.
Ofloxacin 200 mg daily for 7-10 days
is also useful.
3.Cephalosporins: The drug of choice
is Ceftriaxone 3-4 gm once daily for 7
days or 80 mg/kg once daily for 5 days.
It is as effective as chloramphenicol
in reducing fever in typhoid. Other
cephalosporins are also effective (See
Ch. 15)
C.Steroids: In the absence of intestinal
complications, steroids can be used for
severe toxicity, hyperpyrexia, septicemia
and haemolysis along with antibiotics, It 
is given as prednisolone 30-60 mg daily in
divided doses with antacids.
D.Chronic carrier: Ampicillin 1 gm 6 hourly
for one week followed by I gm 8 hourly for
6-12 weeks is needed. Cholecystectomy
may be advised for biliary carriers.
Prevention 
1.Typhoid can be prevented by improving
personal hygiene, sanitary disposal of excreta,
pasteurization of milk, adequate water protection
and identification, isolation and treatment of
chronic carriers.

14 Vaccine: 
a.Injectable Vaccine : A vaccine (TAB)
prepared from heat killed S. typhi organisms
is available for immunization of high risk
persons. It is given in the dose of 0.5 ml
subcutaneously and repeated 4 weeks later
in the dose of l .O ml. It gives protection for
2 years. Given >2 yrs. of age.
b.Oral Vaccine (Ty2la) : Oral Vaccine - l
tablet on alternate days for 4 doses.
Contraindicated in pregnancy in children
<6 yrs. of age. Repeated every 5 years.
Leukemia 
Leukemia is a disease of unknown etiology, character­
ized by an uncontrollable and abnormal proliferation 
of leucocytes and their precursors, which infiltrate 
the body tissues. 
Acute Leukemias 
Acute leukemia is a hematological neoplasm character­
ized by proliferation of malignant hemopoietic blast 
cells. There should be more than 20% blasts cells in 
the bone marrow at clinical presentation. Untreated, 
acute leukemias are rapidly fatal, median survival 
being two months. Death occurs from infection or 
hemorrhage or both. 
Acute leukemias are subdivided into acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) 
on the basis of the blasts present, whether myeloblasts 
or lymphoblasts. The morphology, clinical features, 
cytochemistry, immunophenotypingand molecular 
genetics are used to subdivide AML and ALL into 
their subtypes (Tables 3.14, 3.15, 12.5, 12.6) 
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) 
AML occurs at all ages. AML is subdivided into 8 
subtypes (Table l l.2) based on morphology and cy­
tochemist ry according to FAB classification. 
Acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) 
ALL occurs primarily in children and sometimes after 
the age of 40. FAB classification subdivides ALL into 
3 subtypes (Table 11.3).

b.Alkalinization of urine with soda­
bicarb 2.0 gm four times a day.
c.Allopurinol l 00 mg three times a day
to prevent uric acid nephropathy.
After a course of the above medicines, bone­
marrow aspiration is done to decide whether 
complete remission is achieved 
(Complete 
remission means normocellular bone-marrow B. with less than 5% blast cells). Ifit is not achieved, 
one more cycle of chemotherapy is given or 
alternative treatment is tried. 
CNS prophylaxis: Intrathecal methotrexate 
15 mg/m2 every week for 4-8 weeks following 
complete remission, or cranial irradiation l 800-
2400 rads. may be given to reduce the chance of 
neurological involvement. 
C. Intensification: Methotrexate + Leucovorin
D.Maintenance: This includes administration
of low dose chemotherapy over a period of 36
months. 6 Mercaptopurine 75 mg/m1 daily is
given orally, along with oral methotrexate 20
mg/ m2 once a week. During maintenance period,
combination chemotherapy given for induction
is also used intermittently. Ifthe patient remains
in continuous remission for 3 years maintenance
treatment is stopped.
Result of treatment: 80% of patients go into
complete remission and 40% are cured. The
prognosis depends on age, initial total count,
surface marker characterist ics (T-cell/B-cell
have bad prognosis), mediastinal mass.
Chemotherapy for AML 
A.Induction:
DAT regime is given which consisting of:
Daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 IV bolus on days 1, 2
and 3 or days 4,5 and 6.
Cytosine arabinoside 100 mg/m2/ day by
continuous IV infusion for 7 days.

( 3 > Abdomen 
1hioguanine 100 mg/m2 orally twice a day for 
7 days. Bone-marrow aspiration is done after 3 
weeks and if evidence ofleukemia persists, the 
above cycle is repeated. 
B.Consolidation therapy: This includes 2-6
courses of combination therapy used for
induction. Recently use ofhigher dose of cytosine
arabinoside with daunorubicin or combination
of non-cross resistant drugs has been found to
be of some benefit.
C.Maintenance therapy:
Cytosine arabinoside 60 mg/m2 once a week and
6-'Ihioguanine 40 mg/m2 twice a day orally for 4
days/week is given for 1-3 years. This increases
the duration of disease-free survival.
D.Bone-marrow transplant: This has a high cura­
tive potential. It is done following complete
remission. However, its limitations are high cost
and non-availability of matched donors.
Results of treatment: Sixty percent achieve
complete remission but only 20% get cured.
E.All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is used for the
treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia
(APML)
H.Supportive Treatment
A.Blood/Platelet/ Granulocyte transfusions

Ill. lmmunothera py: 
This is used because a patient in complete 
remission reacts to his blast cells as though they 
were foreign tissue. It may be attempted with 
BCG or allogenic irradiated leukemic cells. 
Chronic Leukemia 
Chronic leukemias have a more indolent behavior 
and better prognosis than acute leukemias. Chronic 
lymphoid leukemia ( CLL) tends to occur in the elderly. 
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is more common 
in middle age. Juvenile CML occurs in children below 
3 years of age. 
Clinical features in CML and CLL 
I.Due to anemia: Pallor, fatigue, dysnea, etc.
IL Due to Organ infiltration:
1.Hepatosplenomegaly
2.Lymphadenopathy: Usually cervical,
mediastinal and axillary. Lymphadeno­
pathy is more common with CLL.
3.Cardiorespiratory: Pulmonary congestion,
infiltration or collapse. Pleural effusion.
4.CNS: Meningeal infiltration, cranial nerve
palsies and paraplegia
5.Skin: Pruritus and nodules, gout
III.Duetothrombocytopenia: Bleeding tendencies
(epistaxis, hematemesis, etc.) in CLL. Platelets
are normal or increased in CML.
IV.Due to increased metabolism: Fever, weight
loss, malaise, perspiration and gout.
Peripheral Blood Picture in CML and CLL 
1.Anemia: Normochromic, normocytic
2.Leucocytes increased
InCML:
Chronic phase shows I ,00,000-5,00,000/cc.
with early granu!ocyte cells (metamyelocyte,
105 

myelo-cyte, promyelocyte, band forms). Only 
occasional blast cells is seen ( <10%). Neutrophil 
alkaline phosphatase is markedly reduced. 
Blast crisis in CML is indicated by an increasing 
basophil count. It may be myeloid or lymphoid 
in origin. Myeloid blast crisis resembles AML, 
but Auer rods are not seen. Lymphoid blast 
crisis is rarer and shows lymphoblasts with 
characteristics such as TdT positivity. 
InCLL: 
50,000-2,00,000/ cc. Majority(>90%) are mature 
small lymphocytes. "Smudge" or "smear" cells 
(degenerative forms) may be present. Absolute 
neutrophil count is normal. Neutropenia occurs 
in advanced CLL. 
3.Platelets are normal or low.
Bone Marrow in CML and CLL 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. Cellularity: Hypercellular 
Erythropo iesis is normoblastic, sometimes 
megaloblastic. Reduced erythroid precursors. 
Leucopoiesis: 
In CML bone-marrow is hypercellular with 
myeloid: erythroid ratio increased. There may 
be myelocytes, promyelocytes, eosinophils and 
basophils. Blast cells or promyelocyte more than 
30% suggests blast crisis in CML. 
In CLL both small and large lymphocytes 
are diffusely infiltrated (25-95%). Myeloid 
precursors are reduced. 
Megakaryocytes are prominent in CML and 
reduced in CLL. 
5.Cytogenetics: Philadelphia chromosome may
be present in myeloid and erythroid precursor
cells in 70-90% of CML cases.
Treatment 
I.Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
106 A.Chemotherapy:·
1.Imatinib Mesylate 400 -800 mg daily
is the drug of choice. Newer drugs if
there is imatinib failure.
2.Busulfan 4 mg/day orally, reduced to
2 mg/day when WBC count falls to
30,000/ c.c.PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
3.Hydroxyurea 1-2 gm orally till WBC
count falls to 10,000/cm. It is used
in patients with chronic myeloid
leukemia not responding to busulfan.
B.Radiotherapy: This may be useful as a
symptomatic measure to reduce the size of
massively enlarged spleen, when cytotoxic
drugs have failed.
C.Splenectomy: This may be required when
enlarged spleen is causing symptoms.
D.Bone Marrow Transplantation is the only
curative treatment.
II.Chronic Lymphatic Leukemia
A.Chemotherapy:
1.Chlorambucil 6-10 mg/day for 14
days with a break of 14 days. When
WBC count falls below 25,000/c.c.
the dose is reduced to 2-4 mg/day. It
is discontinued when the WBC count
falls below 1,000-10,000/c.c.
2.Cyclophosphamide: 2-3 mg/kg. I. V. for
6 days.
B.Radiotherapy: This is useful for large
granular masses if they cause symptoms.
C. Steroids: Prednisolone 40 mg/day may 
improve hemoglobin or platelet count.
D.General supportive measures:
1.Blood transfusion
2.Antibiotics
3.Gamma globulins
Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL) 
Hairy cell leukemia is a rare type of chronic leukemia 
with pancytopenia and marked splenomegaly without 
lymphadenopathy. The typical "hairy" lymphoid cells of 
B-cell origin are seen in the peripheral blood and in
bone marrow aspirates and splenic imprints. These
cells also show a characteristic strong postive tartaric
acid resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) reaction.
15 Malignant Lymphoma 
Definition : Malignant Lymphoma refers to a large 

3 Abdomen 
variety of malignant lymphoproliferative disorders 
arising from lymphoid components of various organs. 
They are classified as Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's 
lymphoma. 
Hodgkin's Lymphoma 
Definition 
Hodgkin's disease is characterized by presence of Reed 
Sternberg cell and is caused by either viral infection 
or deranged immune mechanism. 
Clinical Features 
I.Lymphadenopathy: Cervical, mediastinal,
axillary and inguinal. Unilateral initially, later
bilateral. The glands are painless, discrete and
firm.
II.Hepatosplenomegaly: Moderate to marked non­
tender enlargement ofliver and spleen.
III.Constitutional: Fever, night sweats, weight loss,
anemia and cachexia may occur. Fever may
be remittent, continuous, or Pel Ebstein's type
(Fever for several days interrupted by periods
of remission).
IV.Due to infiltration or metastasis
A.Skin: Pruritus, erythema and herpes zoster
B.Bones: Pain, tenderness and sclerosis (ivory
vertebrae)
C.CNS: Pain, paresthesia and paraplegia
D.GI: Jaundice, ascites and intestinal
obstruction
F.Genitourinary: Hematuria, retention of
urine and backache
Stages (ANN Arbor Staging) 
I.Involvement of a single lymph node region (I)
or of a single extra lymphatic organ (le).
II.Involvement of two or more lymph node regions
on the same side of the diaphragm (II) or
involvement of extralymphatic organ and one
or more lymph regions on the same side of the
diaphragm (Ile).
III.Involvement oflymph node regions on both sides
of the diaphragm (III). It may be accomp-anied
by involvement of spleen (IIIs) or by involvement
of extralymphatic organs (Ille).IV.Diffuse involvement of extralymphatic organs or
tissues with or without associated lymph node
involvement.
Each stage is sub-divided into two categories.
A.For those without symptoms.
B.For those with symptoms, e.g. fever, weight
loss
Treatment 
I.Radiotherapy: Most effective for stages I and II.
II.Chemotherapy: For patients with stages III and
IV.MOPP or ABVD regime may be used.
A.MOPP regime
1.Mustine hydrochloride 6 mg/meter2 
I.V. on Day 1 and 8.
2.Oncovin (Vincristine) 1.4 mg/meter2 
I. V. on Day 1 and 8.
3.Procarbazine 100 mg/meter2 orally
from Day 1 to 14.
4.Prednisolone 40 mg/meter2 orally
from Day 1 to 14.
No drugs are given from Day 15-28.
This is one course.
Six such courses may be given.
B.ABVD regime
1.Adriamycin 25 mg/m2 IV bolus on
day 1,8,14
2.Bleomycin 10mg/m2IVbolusonday
1,14
3.Vinblastine 6 mg/m2 IV bolus on day
1,8,14
4.Dacarbazine 375 mg/m2 IV bolus on
day 1,14
The cycle should be repeated on 29th day. 
III.Splenectomy: Laparotomy and splenectomy is
advocated in many patients except with stage
IV disease.
Advantages:
A.It can be determined whether spleen is
involved.
B.It prevents recurrence in spleen, which is
difficult to treat with radiotherapy due to the
close proximity ofleft kidney and lung.
107 

Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas 
Definition : Non�Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) are a 
heterogenous disease entity characterized by involve­
ment of variety of anatomical sites other than lymph 
nodes e.g. skin, gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow etc. 
Clinical Features 
The clinical presentation has many simjarities to 
Hodgkin's disease. However, the pattern of spread 
is variable and patients may present with disease in 
organs other than lymph nodes or with leukemic 
manifestations. 
l.Lymphadenopathy: Asymmetri cal painless
enlargement of the peripheral lymph node may
occur. Retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph
nodes are frequently affected.
2.Hepatosplenomegaly: Spleen is usually
markedly enlarged. Liver is also enlarged.
3.Anemia: This occurs due to involvement of
the bone marrow, hypersplenism, hemolysis or
autoimmune disease.
4.Gastrointestinal symptoms: Abdominal
pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or intestinal
obstruction may occur due to involvement of
the gastrointestinal tract.
5.Skin: Skin deposits may occur and skin may be
primarily involved in two unusual closely related
T lymphocytic lymphomas -Mycosis fungoides
and Sezary syndrome.
Treatment 
The initial treatment will depend upon whether there

the patients. However, surgery is useful only in selected 
cases with primary extranodal lesions. 
I.Favorable NHL
Therapeutic interventions are postponed until
symptoms develop. Combination chemotherapy
(Table) or total body irradiation is useful. The
clinical course is characterized by continuous
pattern of remission and relapse over a period
of several years.

Immunodeficiency 
Virus (HIV) Disease: 
Acquired Immune 
Deficiency Syndrome 
(AIDS) 
HIV disease is an infectious disease cause by the hu­
man immunodeficiency virus. 
AIDS occurs at a late stage of HIV infection, when 
the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is <200/µL and there 
is documentation of an 
AIDS-defining condition 
(See Table). 
Definition of HIV Infection 
According to the HIV infection case definition(CDC 
2008), a reportable case of HIV infection among adults 
and adolescents aged �13 years is categorized by in­
creasing severity as Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3 (AIDS) or 
Stage unknown as shown in the table below: 
Morphology of HIV 
Etiology 
AIDS is caused by an infection with HIV-1 or HIV-2 
Table 3.18: Staging of HIV Infection (Family Retroviridae, Subfamily Lentivirus). HIV-1 
is the most common cause worldwide. HIV-1 has 
many different strains due to mutations. There are 
three groups M (major, subtypes A-J), 0 {outlier, 
rare) and N (very rare). In India, Group M subtype 
C predominates. 
Transmission of HIV

is contaminated with blood from an HIV positive 
patient is 0.3% and after mucous membrane 
exposure 0.09%. (Similar risk for HBV 
transmission is 6-30% and HCV transmission 
is 1.8%). 
Very low risk:Transmission of HIV from an 
infected health care worker to patients through 
invasive procedures. 
No risk: Saliva, tears, sweat, urine cannot cause 
transmission of HIV. The virus cannot be passed 
through casual or family contact or by insects 
such as mosquitoes. 
Maternal-fetal/infant transmission 
Mother to child risk of transmission is 20-30% 
before birth. The risk increases to 50-65% during 
birth and 10-20% via breast milk. A single dose of 
Nevirapine given to the mother at onset oflabor 
and a single dose to the infant after birth reduces 
the risk of HIV transmission. Breast-feeding 
should be avoided. However, in developing 
countries like India, breast-feeding prevents 
infectious diseases and provides immunity to the 
child, and is therefore advocated after counseling 
the mother. 
Pathophysiology and 
lmmunopathogenesis 
The main action of HIV is to cause the quantitative 
and qualitative deficiency of a subset oflymphocytes 
referred to as T 4 ( CD4+) helper/inducer lymphocytes. 
These lymphocytes express the CD4 cellular receptor 
for HIV on their cell surfacealong with the coreceptors 
( e.g. CCR5, CXCR4). The destruction of these lympho­
cytes leads in turn to suppression or compromise in 
the function of host cellular defense mechanisms, not 
only to HIV but also to opportunistic infectious agents. 
Although the CD4+ T lymphocyte and CD4+ mono­
cyte lineage are the principal cellular targets, HIV can

1. BIN DI NG: HIV binds via the viral envelope protein gp 120 to the CD4 receptor on the target host eel I. 
2. CORECEPTORS (CCR5 and CXCR4) facilitate entry of virus into the host cell. 
3. FUSION of the virus with the host cell membrane and internalization of pre-integration complex (viral RNA and enzymes 
surrounded by capsid protein) 
4. REVERSETRANSCRIPTASE ENZYME converts the viral RNA genome to double stranded DNA.
5.TRANSPORTATION of the DNA to the host nucleus. 
6. INTEGRATION into the host genome by viral enzyme integrase. The HIV provirus remains latent at this stage until the 
infected cell is activated by a number of cellular and viral factors. This is the reason for the interval between the time of 
infection and disease expression. 
7. TRANSCRIPTION ofprovirus DNA into viral rnessenger(mRNA) and genomic RNA. 
8. TRANSLATION of m RNA into proteins. 
9. BUDDING: The viral proteins, enzymes and genomic RNA are assembled at the cell membrane and budding of the progeny
virus occurs at special regions of the host cell membrane. 
10.RELEASE: The viral enzyme protease catalyses the release of mature virions from the host cell. The vi rions infect other host
cells that express CD4 receptors. 
potentially infect virtually any cell that expresses CD4 
(e.g. T and B lymphocytes, macrophages, astrocytes, 
microglial cells, Langerhans' cells, fibroblasts, Chro­
maffin cells, dendritic cells, alveolar macrophages, 
thymus cells). 
Immune Response to HIV Infection 
Both humoral and cellular immune responses to HIV 
develop soon after primary infection. Immune Abnormalities in HIV Disease 
A broad range of immune abnormalities has been 
documented in HIV-infected patients. These include 
both quantitative and qualitative defects in lymphocyte, 
monocyte/macrophage, and natural killer (NK) cell 
function, as well as the development of autoimmune 
phenomena.

Laboratory Tests for Diagnosis of HIV 
Infection 
Table 3.21; Laboratory Criteria for HIV 
Infection for Adults 
Positive result from an HIV antibody screening test 
confirmed by a positive result from a supplemental HIV 
antibody test 
And/Or 
Positive result from any of the following HIV virologic 
(i.e,, non•antibody)tests: HIV nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) 
detection test, HIV p24 antigen test or HIV isolation. 
1.Antibody Screening Tests: The standard
screening test for HIV infection is the detection
of anti-HIV antibodies in the patient's serum
using enzyme·linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA or EIA). HIV-1/HIV-2 combined EIA 
assays are now being used worldwide. This test
is highly sensitive (>99.5%) but not optimally
specific. False positive results can occur in cases
of: antibodies to class 11 antigens, autoantibodies,
hepatic disease, recent influenza vaccination,
acute viral infectionsand children < 18 months
whose mothers are HIV-infected
2.HIV Antibody Test for confirmation of
positive ELISA tests is done by Western Blot
( immunoblotting) assay or immunofluorescence
assay. It tests the presence of antibodies in the
patients' serum against HIV antigens of specific
molecular weights. Antibodies to HIV begin

to appear within 2 weeks of infection, and the 
period of time between initial infection and the 
development of detectable antibodies is rarely 
longer than 3 months (window period). 
The CDC criteria for a positive interpretation of 
Western Blot test is the presence of antibodies to 
any two of three proteins p24, gp41 and gp 160/ 
gp 120. 
"Indeterminate" results are repeated after 4-6 
weeks. 
3.Antigen Detection: The detection of HIV
by the p24 antigen capture assay, an ELISA­
type assay, in serum or CSF is the key to early
diagnosis. The p24 antigen is a soluble protein
from the core of the virus. Plasma p24 antigen
levels rise during the first few weeks following
infection, prior to the appearance of anti-p24
antibodies. The antigen may be detected for upto
six weeks and then disappears with antibody
sero-conversion. The antigen is not detectable
during the asymptomatic clinically silent phase
for a variable period of upto 10 years or more.
The reappearance of p24 antigen precedes onset
of the symptomatic phase of AIDS.
4.HIV DNA:Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
techniquesare used to detect very low levels of
viral DNA integrated into the host genome.

testing may be unreliable (such as those with 
hypogammaglobulinemia). 
Viral Isolation: HIV can be cultured from tissue, 
peripheral blood cells or plasma. 
Monitoring of HIV Infection 
Measurement ofthe CD4+ Tlymphocytecount (flow 
cytometry) and level of plasma HIV RNA (plasma 
viral load or PVL) are important in the routine evalu­
ation and monitoring of HIV-infected individuals. 
They are measured at diagnosis and usually every 3-6 
months thereafter. 
Clinical Manifestationsof HIV Infection 
Primary HIV Infection& Acute HIV 
Syndrome 
It can be asymptomatic or associated with features of 
an acute viral syndrome of variable severity ( 50-70% 
of infected individuals) 3-6 weeks post-exposure. It is 
characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, arthralgias, 
myalgias, maculopapular rash, urticaria, abdominal 
cramps, diarrhea, orogenital ulcers or aseptic menin-gitis. It lasts 1-2 weeks and resolves spontaneously as 
the immune response to HIV develops. Most patients 
will then enter a phase of clinical latency, although 
occasional patients will experience progressive immu • 
nologic and clinical deterioration. It can be identified 
by recent appearance of HIV antibody or by presence 
of viral products with negative or weekly reactive HIV 
antibody. 
Asymptomatic Infection 
The length of time between infection and development 
of disease varies greatly, but the median is estimated to 
be 10 years. HIV disease with active viral replication 
usually progresses during this asymptomat ic period 
and CD4+ T-cell counts fall. The rate of disease pro­
gression is directly correlated with plasma HIV RNA 
levels. Patients with high levels of HIV RNA progress 
to symptomatic disease faster than do those with low 
levels of HIV RNA. 
Symptomatic Disease 
A variety of constitutional symptoms, PGL, neurologi · 
cal disease, secondary infectious diseases, secondary

Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory 
Syndrome (IRIS) 
When a patient starts anti-retroviral therapy (ART), 
his immune deficiencies improve. This sometimes 
results in uncontrolled inflammatory responses. Hence 
the patient may show worsening of clinical features 
or laboratory parameters in spite of improving CD4 
counts and decreasing viral loads. 
Manifestations of IRIS

Management 
General principles 
1.Multidisciplinary approach to reduce HIV­
related morbidity and mortality and improve
quality oflife.
2.Counseling, psychosocial support
3.Education of the patient about HIV, AIDS,
transmission, risk of infections, neoplasms, etc.
4.Education of the general public, colleagues,
employers and hospital staff.
Treatment of Constitutional Symptoms 
1.Fever: Intermittent or long-term use of non­
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
2.Night sweats: Regular use of antipyretic agents
since there is associated fever.
3.Chronic diarrhea: Symptomatic treatment
(till no specific pathogen identified ) with
Loperamide, Diphenoxylate HCl/ Atropine
sulphate, Somatostatin.
4.Fatigue: Evaluate for thyroid or adrenal
insufficiency , neuropathy, myopathy and
depression and treat if detected.
5.Minor oral infections: Oral hairy leukoplakia
needs no treatment unless severe ( oral acyclovir).
Periodontal disease is treated with chlorhexidine.
6.Headache: Symptomatic treatment with non­
steroidal anti-inflammatory agents preferred
to narcotics. Specific pathogen to be identified
and treated.
7.Nutritionaldeficiencies (e.g. iron, Vitamin B 12)
to be corrected, if present.
Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) 
The cornerstone of medical management of HIV 
infection is antiretroviral therapy (ART) since it sup­
presses HIV replication. The drugs that are currently 
licensed for the treatment of HIV infections are listed 
in Chapter 15. 
Goals of Management of ART 
l.Avoid transmission of HIV
2.Maintain CD4+ counts> 350cells/µL
116 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
3.Suppress PVL to undetectable levels ( <50 copies/
mL)
4.To prevent opportunistic infections
5.To manage side effects of ART
6.To reduce HIV-related morbidity and prolong
survival, improve quality of life and to prevent
vertical HIV transmission
ART Drugs (Also Refer to Ch. 15) 
Management of Symptomatic AIDS and 
Advanced Disease 
1.Continue treatment with antiretroviral agentsas
per Tables above. Ensure compliance.
2.Continue treatment of symptomatic complaints.
3.Patients with symptomatic disease pass from
the stage of late moderate symptoms and
immune function deterioratio n to one or more
opportunistic life threatening manifestation and
more severe immune dysfunction. There is an 
increasing risk of mortality as CD4+ counts fall to
<50 cells/µL. These patients need more frequent
clinical examination, diagnosis and immediate
treatment.
4.Various systems are affected throughout the
course of HIV infection and may be the direct
result of HIV infection, manifestation of

opportunistic infections and neoplasms, or side 
effects of ART(Refer to Table 3.30). 
Post Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) 
Antiretroviral drugsfor PEP should be started within
the first few hours and no later than 72 hours after 
occupational and non-occupational exposureand 
continued for 28 days (See 
Table). HIV testing should 
be done initially and following 3 and 6 months. 
Prevention 
Education, counseling, and behavior modification remain the cornerstone of HIV prevention efforts. 
While abstinence is an absolute way to prevent sexual 
transmission, other strategies include 'safe sex practices 
such as use of condoms together with the spermatocide 
nonoxynol-9. Avoidance of shared needle use by ID Us 
is critical. If possible, HIV-positive women should 
avoid breast-feeding (in India breast-feeding is benefi­
cial and mixed feeding is absolutely contraindicated) 
as the virus can be transmitted to infants via this route. 
Prevention of exposure is the best strategy and stresses 
the use of universal precautions and proper handling 
of needles and other potentially contaminated objects.

2 Examination 
A: Inspection and Palpation 
I.Shape of the Chest
Normally the chest is bilaterally symmetrical,
with smooth contours, and slight recession below
the clavicles. On cross-section, it is ellipsoidal
in shape, its anteroposterior diameter is lesser
than its transverse diameter with a ratio of 5:7.
The subcostal angle is acute, about 70° and
the interspaces are broader anteriorly than
posteriorly.,-------­! 
124 Abttormal Shapes of the Che.st 
I.Rickets (pigeon breast or keeled chest or
pectus carinatum): There is depression
on either side of the sternum often
associated with bead like enlargement at the
costochondral junction (rickety rosary) and
a transverse groove passing outwards from
the xiphisternum to the mid-axillary line
(Harrison's sulcus). Sometimes, the sternumPRACTICAL MEDICINE 
is unduly prominent and the cross-sectio n 
is triangular. 
2.Funnel chest (Cobbler's chest or pectus
excavatum): There is a depression in the
lower part of the sternum which may be
congenital, following rickets in childhood
or an occupational deformity in cobblers.
Due to the sternal depression, the normal
cardiac shadow may appear enlarged on
X-ray chest (Pomfret's heart).

less oblique. This is seen in emphysema, old 
age and infancy. The Ratio of AP diameter 
to transverse diameter is normally 5:7. In 
the barrel-shaped chest it is l: l or more. 
4. Spinal deformities: Kyphosis or scoliosis
(Ch. I) due to any cause may lead to
asymmetry and may decrease the size of the
thoracic cage and restrict lung movements
and volume.
Fig.4 6 Chestwa 'I appearance with Kyphosco .ios1s 
5. Bulging: One side may bulge in pleural
effusion, pneumothorax, tumors,aneurysm,
empyema necessitans, cardiomegaly or
scoliosis. Localized bulging is seen in
aortic aneurysm, pericardia! effusion, liver
abscess, chest wall tumors etc.
6.Depression or flattening: One side of the
chest or a part of it may be depressed
or flattened in fibrosis, collapse, pleural
adhesions, unilateral muscle wasting due
to poliomyelitis or congenital absence of
pectoralis muscles.
7.Flat chest (phth inoid chest): The
anteroposterior diameter is reduced in
chronic nasal obstruction due to adenoid
lymphoid hypertrophy, bilateral TB or
childhood rickets. In advanced TB, the
scapula is winged and is called Alar chest.
AP: Transverse Diameter Ratio is 1:2 or
less.
II.Respiratory Rate
The normal rate in adults is 16 20 respirations
per minute {in children about 40 per min.) It
bears a definite ratio with the pulse rate of about
1:4. A.Increased respiratory rate (tachypnea)
I. Exertion and excitement.
2.Fevers e.g. pneumonias
3.Anoxemia and acidosis
4. Anemia and poisoning
5.Pain whilst breathing e.g. pleurisy
B. Decreased respiratory rate (bradypnea)
1.Narcotic poisoning e.g. opium
2.Brain tumour
C.Dyspnea: Breathlessness

Ill. Respiratory Rhythm 
The normal respiration has regular rhythm with 
inspiration longer than expiration. Irregular 
respiration may be of the following types: 
A.Cheyne-Stokes Respiration: This consists
of rhythmical alteration of apnea and
hyperpnea due to anoxemia. Anoxemia
125 

126 abolishes spontaneous rhythmic activity 
of breathing. Consequent apnea results in 
accumulation of CO2 in the body, thereby 
stimulating the respiratory centre and 
causing hyperventilation. This causes 
CO2 washout and results in depression of 
respiratory centre and apnea and thus the 
cycle continues. 
Causes: 
l.Left ventricular failure
2.Increased intra cranial pressure with
damage to both cerebral hemisphere
and diencephalon.
3.Narcotic poisoning: opium,
barbiturates etc.
4.Uremia
5.Deep sleep

B.Kussmaul's respiration: This is
characterized by deep and rapid respiration
(air-hunger) and is seen in diabetic
ketoacidosis, alcoholic or starvation
ketoacidosis and in uremia.

C.Biot'srespiration (chaotic breathing) : This
is irregularly irregular respiration seen in
meningitis or raised intracranial pressure.
Fig.4.9 B1ot's resp1rat1on 
D.Apneustic respiration : It is characterized
by full inspiration followed by a pause,
alternating with full expiration followed
by a pause. Each pause is 2-3 seconds. It is
seen in pontine lesions.PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
Fig 4 1 O Apneusticresp1rat1on 
E.Stridor: This is characterized by prolonged
inspiration through an obstructed upper
airway, which produces a characteristic
sound.
Causes:
l.Laryngeal or tracheal obstruction
2.Laryngeal diphtheria
3.Mediastinal growth
F.Wheezing: This is characteri zed by
prolonged expiration th rough an obstructed
lower airway, bronchi, bronchioles, etc. This
can also occur in cardiac and renal asthma.

F.Stertor: Stertorous breathing occurs in
coma or deep sleep or in dying patients
(death rattle -rattling noise in throat).
IV.Type of Breathing
The normal breathing in males and some females
is abdominothoracic i.e. both the abdomen and
thorax are moving during the act of respiration
but the abdominal movements are more
prominent. The normal breathing in majority
offemales is thoracoabdominal i.e. the thoracic
movements are more prominent than abdominal
movements:
l.Thorade breathing: Thethoracicmovements 
are predominant and abdominal movements
are minimal. It occurs with diaphragmatic
paralysis, peritonitis and severe ascites.
2.Abdominal breathing: The abdominal
movements are predominant and thoracic
movements are minimal. It occurs in
pleurisy and collapse of the lung.

( 4 Respiratory System 
v.Movements of the Chest
Normally both the sides of the chest wall move
uniformly and there is no bulging, or indrawing
of the interspace s. Accessory muscles of
respiration are usually not required for the act
of breathing.
Normally, on taking a deep breadth, the chest
circumference (measured at the level of the
nipple) increases by 2 inches.
A.Unilateral diminished movements
I.Obstruction to the main bronchus
2.Consolidation
3.Fibrosis of the lung and pleural
adhesions
4.Massive collapse
5.Hydropneumothorax
6.Pleural Effusion
B.Bilateral diminished movements
I.Emphysema
2.Bilateral fibrosis, collapse, consolida­
tion or hydropneumothorax
3.Bronchial asthma
The accessory muscles of respiration, alae nasi 
and sternomastoid are normally not required for 
respiration. However in any conditions that cause 
respiratory embarrassment, they are required to 
assist breathing and may therefore be prominent. VI_ Mediostinum 
The med iastinum is normally central. The shift of 
the mediastinum can be detected by noting the 
position of trachea and apex beat. On inspection, 
sternocleidomastoid becomes more prominent 
on side to which trachea is shifted. This is Trail
Sign. 
The trachea is examined by inserting finger 
upward in the suprasternal notch and noting 
its relation to the two sternomastoid muscles. 
Normally the trachea may be shifted slightly to 
the right or is central. 
The apex beat is examined with the palm of the 
hand and its position is noted. Normally the 
apex beat is in the fifth left intercostal space just 
inside the mid-clavicular line. It may be shifted 
inward or outward depending upon the shift of 
the mediastinum. 
127 

The position of mediastinum in various 
respiratory diseases is given in the table. 
The apex beat alone may be shifted in scoliosis, 
funnel shaped depression of the sternum and 
with cardiac disease.

VII.Tactile Vocal Fremitus (TVF):
128 Definition
TVF is the tactile perception of vibrations
communicated to the chest wall from the larynx
via the bronchi and lungs during the act of
phonation.
Mechanism
TVF occurs when sound vibrations from the
larynx pass down the bronchi and cause the
lungs and the chest wall to vibrate. However, the
spoken tones must have the same fundamentalPRACTICAL MEDICINE 
frequency as the lungs and the chest wall. The 
fundamental frequency of female voice is often 
higher than that of the lungs, therefore TVF may 
be markedly diminished or absent in women. In 
children, although the fundamental frequency 
is high, TVF can be appreciated because it 
corresponds to the fundamental frequency of 
the small lungs. 
Significance 
I.TVF is increased in
1.Consolidation which may be due to
pyogenic or tuberculous infections
2.Following pulmonary infarction
3. Surrounding a malignant lesion
superficial cavity.
II.TVF is decreased in
A.Pleural diseases:
1.Pleural effusion
2.Pneumothorax
3.Hydropneumothorax
B.Bronchial diseases:
1.Bronchial obstruction
C.Lung diseases:
1.Emphysema
2.Pulmonary fibrosis
3.Pulmonary collapse
Fig 4. 14 ·Tactile Vocal Frem1tus 
VIII.Other Vibrations
Normally when the patient breathes, the
palpating hand does not feel any vibrations.
However, vibrations may be felt in some diseases
as follows:
1.Pleural Friction Rub: This occurs initially

( 4 J Respiratory System 
in pleurisy due to rubbing of the two pleural 
surfaces. It is usually felt at the peak of 
inspiration or early expiration. 
2.Bronchial Fremitus: This occurs in
bronchitis, bronchial asthma and chronic
obstructive lung disease.
3.Palpable Rales: This occurs in
bronchiectasis, pulmonar y fibrosis and
pulmonary congestion.
IX.Tenderness
Tenderness over the chest wall may be present
in local injury, myositis, amebic abscess ofliver,
pyogenic abscess of liver and empyema.
B : Percussion 
The normal percussion note of the chest is due to the 
underlying lung tissue, containing normal amount of 
air in the air vesicles, air sacs and air passages. It has 
a distinctive and clear character with low pitch. The 
front of the chest yields a more resonant note than 
the back, because of the lesser bulk of musculature in 
front than at the back. 
Impaired note: When the amount of air in the alveoli 
decreases, as in consolidation, infiltration, fibrosis and 
collapse of the lung, the lung fails to vibrate sufficiently 
to the percussion stroke. This causes loss of resonance 
resulting in an impaired note. 
Dull-note: An impaired note of greater degree is a dull 
note. In addition to consolidation, infiltration, fibrosis 
and collapse oflung, it is found in pleural thickening. 
Stony dull note: A percussion note completely devoid 
F,g 4 15 Percusso1n of Chest F,g. 4.16:Clav,cular Percussion 
of resonance or displaying extreme dullness is a stony 
dull note. It is classically encountered over a pleural 
effusion, because fluid dampens the vibration of both 
the chest wall and the underlying relaxed lung. It may 
also occur in lung fibrosis with pleural thickening or 
with solid intrathoracic tumour. 
Tympany: This is a drum like resonance, which is 
normally encountered over the stomach, intestines, 
larynx and trachea. When it occurs over the chest 
wall it may be due to: 
l.Pneumothorax
2.Superficial empty cavity
3.Emphysema
Sub tympany {Skodaic resonance): A hyperreso-nant 
note with a boxy quality, which occurs due to the 
relaxed lung just above the level of pleural effusion. 
Hyper-resonance: A note in between in pitch between 
normal resonance and tympany can be elicited over 
the normal lung tissue by keeping the chest wall in full 
inspiration, during percussion. It occurs in: 
l. Pneumothorax
2.Emphysema
3.Large cavity with a thin wall
4.Congenital lung cyst
5.Emphysematous bullae
6.Eventration of diaphragm
Bell tympany: "Inis is a high pitched tympanic or 
metallic sound, heard over the chest in case of massive 
pneumothorax. When a silver coin is placed on the 
affected side and percussed with a second silver coin, 
129 

the ear or stethoscope applied over the opposite side of 
the chest may detect a clear bell like sound resembling 
the sound of"hammer on an anvil''. 
I.Kronig's Isthmus
Definition: Kronig's 
isthmus is a band of 
resonance 5-7 ems in width, connecting lung 
resonance over the anterior and posterior aspects 
of each side of the chest. It is bounded medially 
by dullness of the neck muscles and laterally by 
dullness of the shoulder muscles. 
Abnormalities: 
l.Absence on 
either side suggests pulmonary
fibrosis due to tuberculosis.
2.Increased width of resonance suggests
emphysema.
II.Liver Dullness and Span
Normal liver dullness is in the right intercostal
space, in the fifth space in the mid-davicular
line, in 
the seventh space in the anterior axillary
line and in the ninth space in the scapular line.
Liver dullness may be present in the fourth space
in the 
mid-davicular line in amebic or pyogenic
abscess of the liver, diaphragmatic paralysis or
collapse of the lower lobe of the lung.
It may be pushed down to the sixth space in the
mid-clavicular line in emphysema, right-sided
pneumothorax, air in the peritoneal cavity and
terminal cirrhosis.
Ill. Cardiac Dullness 
On the left side of the chest wall, the lung 
resonance is encroached by an area of cardiac 
dullness due to the presence of the heart. The 
cardiac dullness is normally in the third and 
fourth left parasternal 
line and the fifth left mid 
davicular line. 
This area of dullness may be decreased in 
emphysema, and left sided pneumothorax. It 
may be increased with cardiomegaly and push 
of the heart to the left side. 
IV.Tidal Percussion
Percussion of the upper border of the liver
130 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
dullness on the right side anteriorly, on 
inspiration and expiration serves to determine 
the range of lung expansion and movement of 
diaphram. It is restricted in : 
1.Pulmonary diseases at lung base e.g.
pulmonary fibrosis
2.Empyema
3.Hepatic amebiasis
4.Sub-diaphragmatic abscess.
5.Diaphram palsy
V.Traube's Area OR Space
It is bounded above by the lung resonance, below
by the costal margins, on the right by the left
border of liver and on the 
left by spleen.
It is normally occupied by the stomach, hence on
percussion the note is tympanic due to stomach
gas. IfTraube's area is dull it suggests:
I.Pleural effusion on the left side.
2.Splenomegaly
3.Fundic tumor
4.Full stomach
VI.Shifting Dullness
In case ofhydropneumothorax in sitting position
there is a 
hyperresonant note above followed
by dullness below. On changing the posture to
supine, this area of dullness of the fluid changes
as air and fluid will shift. This is shifting dullness
and always signifies presence of both air and
fluid.
VII.Coin-test
A coin is placed flat on the chest and struck
with another coin. On auscultation of the back
of the chest on the same side, a metallic or bell
like sound is heard.
Cause: Pneumothorax
VII.
Percussion Myokymia
In a chronically wasted individual as in
pulmonar y tuberculosis, a percussion stroke over
the front of the chest, dose to the sternum, may
cause a transienttwitchingofthe musdes, which

( 4 ) Respiratory System 
is more marked on the side of the pulmonary 
affection. This is called percussion myokymia. 
Limitations of percussion 
1.It is not possible to percuss deeper than 5 cm.
Hence it is not possible to detect a lung lesion
covered by a layer of air more than 5 cm thick
or fluid 1 cm thick.
2.A lesion less than 2 cm in diameter does not
cause any change in the percussion note.
3.Free fluid less than 200 ml in the pleural cavity
may not be detected on percussion.
C: Auscultation 
Auscultation of the chest must be done to note the 
Fig 4 18 Auscultation type of breathing, presence of any foreign sounds and 
vocal resonance. 
The stethoscope should be firm! y placed over the chest 
to prevent sounds resulting from the movement of the 
chest. Hair on the chest wall may produce a crackling 
sound and may be mistaken as rates. A similar sound 
may occur in nervous patient due to shivering. 
I.Breath Sounds
1.Vesicular: This is characterized by active
inspiration due to the passage of air into
the bronchi and alveoli followed without
a pause by passive expiration due to the
elastic recoil of the alveoli which occurs
maximally in the early phases giving an
apparent impression of short expiration.
The character of the sound is rustling due
to the passage through the alveoli which
selectively transmits lower frequency
sounds and dampens the high frequency
sounds. It is normally heard over the chest.
The normal breath sounds are vesicular and
not bronchial because the lungs and chest
wall act as an acoustic filter narrowing the
range of audible frequencies to 100-400 Hz.
2.Bronchial: This is characterized by active
inspiration due to the passage of air into
the bronchi. The alveolar phase is absent
(because of consolidation in alveoli) and
hence expiration is also active, occupying
the same duration of time as inspiration.
Since the alveolar phase is absent there
is no rustling quality to the sound but a
hollow bronchial character because now
both lower and higher frequency sounds
are conducted.
It is heard in patients with cavity,

consolidation, partial collapse, open 
pneumothorax and above the level of 
pleural effusion. 
There are 3 typesofbronchial breath sounds: 
A.Tubular: This is a high-pitched
bronchial sound heard in
consolidation, above the level of
pleural effusion and over cavity.
B.Cavernous: This is a low pitched
bronchial sound heard over an
irregular cavity.
C.Amphoric: This is a low pitched
bronchial sound with high-pitched
over-tones heard over smooth walled
cavities and an open pneumothorax.
3.Vesicular Breath Sounds with Prolonged
Expiration (Broncho-Vesicular):
Here there is active inspiration due to
passage of air into bronchi and alveoli
giving vesicular type ofinspiratory sound.
However during expiration there is
increased resistance in the airway due to
spasm causing expiration to be active and
hence equal to or more than inspiration.
Since the alveolar phase is present, there
is no pause between inspiration and
expiration.PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
It is heard in bronchial asthma, chronic 
bronchitis and emphysema. In emphysema. 
breath sounds are diminished because 
abnormally large amount of air dampens 
the breath sounds. 
II.Foreign Sounds
Rales: Rates are the crackling sounds that
originate in the smaller bronchi or alveoli, due
to explosive opening of the airways in that part
of the lung that is deflated to residual volume.
Rates were previously believed to be due to 
bubbling of air through liquid in the airways.
However this seems unlikely because:
a.Rales may be present only in inspiration.
Sounds caused by air bubbling through
fluid should be heard during both phases
of respiration.
b.Rales are constantly present in pulmonary
fibrosis where there is no increase in
secretions.
Causes 
a.Left heart failure: Rales are present in the
de-pendent parts of the lung, accentuated
by exertion.
b.Inflammatory exudates: Bronchit is,
Bronchopneumonia and pneumonia
c.Lung abscess, cavity and bronchiectasis
d.Pulmonary congestion, edema (eg ARDS)
and fibrosis
e.COPD
Types 
a.Early inspiratory: Due to opening of
larger airways closed by the air-trapping
mechanism during the previous expiration.
They are scanty, low-pitched and not
posture dependent, e.g. chronic bronchitis.
b.Mid-inspiratory: e.g. Bronchiectasis, cavity, 
lung abscess.
c.Late-inspiratory: Due to delayed opening
of both the lungs in restrictive defects
e.g. pulmonary edema and fibrosis. They
are profuse, high pitched and altered by 
posture, e.g. bending forward or lying
down reduces them.

( 4 Respiratory System 
d.Expiratory rales: These are characteristic
of severe-airway obstruction. They arise by
the re opening of temporarily closed by the
trapping mechanism during expiration.
Rhonchi: Rhonchi or Wheeze is a continuous 
musical sound generated by air buzzing past 
the airway. The lung acts like the reed of a wind 
instrument, sounding when the passage of air 
vibrates the opposing airway walls 
which are 
just touching. 
Causes 
a.Bronchial asthma
b.Bronchitis
c.Chronic obstructive lung disease
d.Localized obstruction (Malignancy)
e.Tropical eosinophilia
f.Cardiac failure
Types 
a.Polyphonic: This is 
the most common type
of wheezing where an expiratory musical
sound contains several notes of different
pitch. They result from oscillation of several
large bronchi simultaneously.
b.Monophonic: This is a single musical sound
arising from a single 
airway brought to a
point of closure as in chronic bronchitis or
emphysema.
c.It is seldom loud enough to be 
heard by an
unaided ear. An except ion is stridor, a very
loud monophonic musical sound produced
by laryngeal or tracheal obstruction.
Stridor: Stridor is a loud inspiratory sound 
heard over the airways due to obstruction to the 
respiratory tract. 
Laryngeal stridor is a high pitched sound heard 
over the larynx due to laryngeal 
obstruction with 
foreign body, diphtheria, anaphylaxis, laryngitis, 
etc. It is a medical emergency and the patient 
may require respiratory support. 
Tracheal stridor is a low pitched sound heard 
over the trachea due to tracheal obstruction. 
N.B.: Obstruction of bronchi would cause
wheeze or rhonchi.Pleural Friction Rub 
N ormallythe parietal pleura slides smoothly over 
the visceral pleura due to the presence of a thin 
layer of lubricating secretion between the two 
layers. In pleural inflammation the roughened 
surfaces of pleura rub against each other giving 
rise to a characteristic friction rub. 
Since the movement of the visceral over the 
parietal 
pleura is greatest at the lateral and 
posterior bases of the lung and decreases 
superiorly, the pleural rub is best heard at the 
bases in the axillary line. 
Characteristics 
l.Rubbing or creaking
2.Superficial sound close to the ear
3.Accentuated by increased pressure of
the chest piece on the chest wall & deep
inspiration.
4.Audible during both the phases of
respiration, disappears on holding the
breath.
5.Confined to a localized area
6.Not altered by coughing
7.Associated with local pain and tenderness.
Hamman' s Mediastinal Crunch : It is a clicking,
rhythmical sound synchronus with cardiac
cycle. 
Heard with or without stethoscope e.g.
Mediastinal 
Emphysema, esophageal rupture.
Ill. Vocal Resonance 
The laryngeal vibrations can be normally audible 
through 
the stethoscope as vocal resonance. 
High-pitched sounds, which are not easily 
palpable, can be picked up as vocal resonance. 
The vocal resonance of normal intensity conveys 
the impression of being produced near the 
stethoscope. It is examined by asking the patient 
to repeat the words "one, one, one" etc. and 
identical points on the chest wall should be 
alternately auscultated rapidly. 
Vocal resonance may be diminished or absent 
in pleural effusion, pneumothorax, thickened 
pleura and emphysema. 
Vocal resonance may be increased and altered 
as follows:

1.Bronchophon y
This is increased vocal resonance where the
sounds are loud and clear but the words
are not distinguishable. This is seen in
consolidation, large superficial cavity and
just above level of pleural effusion.
2.Egophony
When spoken voices are auscultated over
the chest, a nasal quality is imparted to the
sound which resembles the bleating of a
goat.Causes: Above the level of pleural effusion 
and pneumothorax. 
Mechanism: The relaxed lung above the 
pleural effusion transmits the overtones 
but dampens the lower fundamental tones 
giving rise to egophony. 
3.Whispering Pectoriloqu y
Whispered voice is transmitted to the chest
wall with sufficient clarity to maintain its
syllabic character, so that individual words
are clearly 
distinguishable as if uttered
directly into the examiner's ears.

Causes 
a.Cavitycommunicatingwith bronchus.
b. Diffuse consolidation oflung adjacent
to bronchus.
4.Succussion Splash
This is the splashing sound heard over the
chest either with the stethoscope or with
the unaided ear applied to the chest wall,
when the patient is shaken suddenly by the
examiner.
Causes
a.Hydropneumothorax
b.Large cavity containing fluid and air.
c.Herniation of stomach or colon into
the thorax.
5.Post-tussive Suction
A sucking sound heard over the chest wall
during the long inspiration that follows a
bout of coughing. It indicate thin-walled
compressible lung cavity, communicating
with the bronchus.
6.Post-tussive Rates
Rates which are not audible during normal
respiration but are heard after making the
patient cough are post-tussive rales. They
signify cavity filled with thick material
which is dislodged during coughing
allowing air to bubble through the
remaining fluid, producing the rates.
3 Pleural Effusion 
Definition: Pleural effusion is collection of excess 
quantity of fluid in the pleural space. 
Pathophysiology: Pleural fluid is secreted by the 
parietal and visceral layers of pleura. Majority of the 
fluid is absorbed by the lymphatics and the remainder 
is absorbed by the lung or chest wall across the meso­
thelium. Excessive fluid collects (according to Frank 
Starlings law of hydrostatic pressure) due to excessive 
back pressure from the visceral surface (e.g. CCF), 
decrease in serum proteins (e.g. nephrotic syndrome), 
pulmonary inflammation or lymphatic obstruction 
( e.g. pneumonia, infiltrating tumor) or increase nega­
tive pressure in pleural space (e.g. Atelectasis). Causes

B.Dyspnea: lf massive collection of fluid
occurs rapidly. 
C.Drycough
D.Systemic symptoms : (may or may not be
present) fever, anorexia, 
malaise, weight
loss, indicative of underlying disease.
II.Signs: {500 cc of fluid is required to produce
signs).
138 A.Inspection:
l.Bulging of intercostal spaces on the
affected side with fullness of hypo­
chondrium iflarge effusion.
2.Diminished mobility of the chest wall
on the affected side.
3.Shift of the 
mediastinum to the
opposite side. 
i.e. Trailes sign positive
(sternomastoid 
muscle on the side of
the mediastinal displacement may be
prominent) as shift of trachea to one
side causes relaxation of deep cervical
fascia on that side and apex impulse
is displaced to the side 
opposite to the
effusion.
B.Palpation
I.Diminished mobility of the chest on
the affected side.PRACTICAL 
MEDICINE 
2.Shift 
of the mediastinum to the
opposite side.
3.Diminished 
or absent TVF on the
affected side below the level of the
fluid and increased TVF at the level
of the fluid.
C.Percussion:
I.Stony dullness with increased
resistance and no shifting dullness
below the level of fluid.
2.Skodaic resonance (boxy note) just
above the effusion.
3.Obliteration of Traube's space if left
sided effusion.
4.Grocco's triangle: Triangular area of
dullness against the vertebral column
at the base of the opposite lung, due
to collapse of that lung.
5.Ellis' S shaped curve:
a.It is a radiological illusion.
b.In free pleural effusion the fluid
collected in the pleural space
assumes the highest position in
axilla due to capillary action.
Hence the stony dullness arising
posteriorly near spine reaches
the highest point in posterior
axilla and then again comes down
anteriorly.

D.Auscultation:
1.Diminished or absent breath sounds
below the level of the effusion.
2.Bronchial breathing at the level of
pleural effusion due to relaxed lung.
3.Egophony at the level of the pleural
effusion.
4.Diminished or absent vocal fremitus
below the level of the fluid.

III.Biochemical Investigations:
A.Proteins more than 3 gm% -exudate; less
than 3 gm% -transudate.
B.Sugar diminished in rheumatoid arthritis,
infections, malignancy.
C.LDH increased in tuberculous effusion.
D.Amylase increased in pancreatitis rupture
of esophagus and salivary gland abscess.
139 

E.Adenosine deaminase activity is increased
in tuberculous pleural effusion.
F.Hyaluronidase is increased in mesothelioma
of pleura.
G.Light's criteria using serum and pleural fluid
albumin and LDH are used to differentiate
transudate from exudate.
Exudative Pleural Effusion meets atleast
one criteria, Transudative meets none:
i.Pleural fluid protein / serum protein
>0.5.
ii.Pleural fluid LDH / 
serum LDH > 0.6.
iii.Pleural fluid LDH more than two
thirds normal upper limit for serum.
These criteria misidentify 25% of 
transudates as exudates. 
H.Serum-to-pleural fluid albumin gradient
(serum albumin minus pleural fluid
albumin) of < 1.2 g/dL indicates the
presence of exudate. Difference >3.1 gm/
di indicate it is Transudative.

Effusion due to Heart Failure 
l.Most common cause of pleural Effusion.
2.It is Transudative and usually bilateral.
3.Diagnostic thoracentesis is usually not
required. Heart failure should be treated.
4.A pleural fluid NT -ProBNP > 1500 pg/ml
is diagnostic of pleural effusion secondary
to congestive heart failure.
VI.Synpneumonic or Parapneumonic Effusion :
This is said to occur when there is simultaneous
pneumonia in the lung covered by pleural
effusion.

( 4 > Respiratory System 
l.It is associated with bacterial pneumonia,
Lung abscess, or bronchiectasis which are
the most common causes of exudative
pleural effusion. It is also associated with
malignancy and pulmonary infarction.
2.Patient usually present with Acute
(Bacterial) orsubacute (Anaerobic) onset of
fever, chest pain, cough with expectoration;
weight loss and mild anaemia if subacute.
3.The physical findings of pleural effusion
which are altered are:
a.Bronchial breath sounds are very well
heard
b.Rales may be present
c.Vocal resonance is increased because
the relaxed lung is filled with exudate
in consolidation, which is a good
conductor of sound.
4.Following features may indicate empyema:
a.Patient not responding to current
antibiotics.
b.Grossly purulent fluid.
c.Pleural fluid WBC > 50,000 / µI or
PMN > 1000 / µl.
d.Pleural fluid pH < 7 .20. ( other causes
-oesophageal rupture, Rheumatoid
pleural, TB pleuritis, Lupus Pleuritis)
e.Pleural fluid glucose < 60 mg/di.
f.LDH > 1000 IU/L.
g.Positive Microscopy or culture of
pleural fluid.
h.TNFa levels higher than 80 pg/ml
also suggest Empyema.
VII.Effusion Secondary to Malignancy
l.Second most common type of Exudative
Pleural Effusion. Lung carcinoma, Breast
carcinoma and Lymphoma account for75%
of cases.
2.Dyspnea is out of propectin to the size of
pleural effusion. Other systemic features to
note are -weight loss, cachexia, clubbing,
non-metastatic manifestations of the
tumor.
3.Patient may present with signs ofpleural effusion, collapse, consolidation, 
congestion or a local area of dullness. 
4.Pleural fluid is exudative, glucose level is
reduced.
5.For definitive diagnosis : Pleural fluid
cytology (diagnostic), other modalities like
Thorocoscopy, CT or USG guided biopsy
of pleural thickening / nodules.
VIII.Mesothelioma
1.Primary tumours of mesothelial cells lining
the pleural cavities; most related to Asbestos
exposure.
2.Patients have chest pain and shortness of
breath.
3.Most signs are similar to pleural effusion
due to other causes, but mediastinal shift
will be to the same side.
4.X-ray chest-Generalised pleural thickening
with 
shrunken hemithorax.
5.Thoracoscopy or open pleural biopsy
establishes the diagnosis.
6.Treatment
a.Opiates for chest pain
b. Oxygen for shortness of breath.
IX.Effusion secondary to pulmonary embolization
1.Patient usually presents with Dyspnea.
2.Pleural Effusion is exudativeortransudative.
3.Treat underlying emboli i.e. Anticoagula ­
tion. If pleural effusion increases in size
after anticoagulation, patient has either
recurrent emboli or a complication like
Hemothorax or Pleural infection.
X.Tuberculous Pleural Effusion
l.Usually associated with primary TB and
occurs due to hypersenstivity reaction to 
tuberculous protein in pleural space.
2.Clinical features : Fever, weight loss,
dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, dry cough
along with classical signs of pleural effusion.
3.Pleural fluid examination:
a.Exudate with small lymphocytes
predominant
141 

b.ADA> 40 IU/L, IFN y > 140 pg/ml
c.Pleural fluid culture
4.Needle biopsy of pleura or thoracoscopy if
required.
5.Treat underlying TB
XI.Effusion Secondary to Viral Infection
I.20% of undiagnosed exudative effusions.
2.These effusions resolve spontaneously with
no long term residual effusion.
3.Aggressive Management is not required,
particularly if patient is improving.
XII.Hepatic Hydrothorax
142 l.Defined as Pleural 
Effusion, usually greater
than 500 ml, in patients with cirrhosis and
without primary cardiac, pulmonary or
pleural disease. Pleural effusion occurs in
5-10% of patients with cirrhosis.
2.Pathogenesis
Results from passage of peritoneal fluid
through small openings in the diaphgram
into the pleural space. The negative intra
thoracic pressure favours the passage of
fluid from intra-abdominal to the pleural
space.
3.Clinical manifestations
a.Patients present with shortness of
breath, cough, hypoxemia, chest
dicomfort.
b.Ascites is not always present, although
other features of cirrhosis may be
present.
c.Less common presentation
i.Tension hydrothorax -severe
dyspnea, hypotension.
ii.Spontaneous Bacterial Empyema
-defined as P MN cell count > 500
cells/ mm> or positive culture with
exclusion of a parapneumonic
effusion.
4.Pleural effusion is transudative but
thoracentesis is always done to rule out
other causes of pleural effusion.
5. Management
a.Sodium Restriction, diruetics ( similar
to ascites)PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
b.Refractory hydrothoraxmanagement
i.Thoracentesis -diuretics
should be continued even after
thoracentesis. Not more than 2
litres of pleural fluid should be
removed, to prevent pulmonary
edema and hypotension.
ii.Transjugular intrahepatic
portosystemic shunt (TIPS).
iii.Pleurodesis -Mechanical I
chemical.
iv.Thoracoscopic repair •
Diaphgramatic repair involving
a pleural flap and surgical mesh
reinforcement.
6.Treatment of infection -spontaneous
bacterial empyema.
7.Other treatment options -Octreotide,
terlipressin with albumin.
XIII.Chylothorax
I.Causes : Trauma (Most frequently during
thoracic surgery), Tumor in mediastinum.
2.Patients have 
dyspnea and present with
large pleural effusion.
3.Pleural fluid : Milky fluid, Triglyceride
levels> 110 mg/di.
4.Lymphangiogram and Mediastinal CT scan
for Tumor / lymph 
nodes should be done
if trauma is not the cause.
5.Treatment
a.Insertion of I CD, octreotide.
b.Pleuoperit oneal shunt if above
modalities fail.
c.Ligation of thoracic duct
6.Avoid prolonged ICD drainage of
chycothoraces as it will lead to malnutrition
and immunologic incompetence.
XIV.Hemothorax
1.Diagnosed 
when hematocrit of pleural fluid
is more than one-half of that in peripheral
blood.
2.Causes • Trauma, rupture of 
blood vessel
or tumor

( 4 > Respiratory System 
3.Treated with Tube Thoracostomy. It also
allows quantification of bleeding.
4.Lacerated 
pleura treated by apposition of
pleural surfaces.
5.If pleural hemorrhage exceeds 200 ml/h,
thoracoscopy or thoracotomy should be
done.
XV.Miscellaneous causes
1.Serum Amylases level elevated in
oesophageal rupture or pancreatitis
2.Intra abdominal abcess -Patient 
is febrile,
high PMN in pleural fluid; no pulmonary
pathology.
3.Ascites 
with pleural effusion -Benign
ovarian tumor (Meig' s syndrome), Ovarian
hyperstimulation syndrome.
4.Post CABG: (a) Effusion within first few
weeks are typically left sided, bloody, large
numbers of eosinophils, responding to one
or two thoracentesis; ( b) Effusions after first
few weeks are typically left sided, dear, with
small lymphocyte predominance and tend
to recur.
Treatment 
I For Pleural Effusion 
1.General: Rest, adequate nutrition, vi tam ins
2.Management of fluid: Thoracocentesis or
pleural tapping if large effusion, cardio-
respiratory embarrassment or empyemaII. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 3.Chest physiotherapy to encourage expansion
oflower chest
4.For recurrent pleural effusion e.g.
malignancy.
1.Pleurodesis -Pleural abrasion, Talc,
Doxycydine.
2.Placement of Small Indwelling
Catheter
ForEmpyema 
I.Antibiotics: The correct antibiotic 
could be
best selected by culturing the pleural fluid
followed by antibiotic sensitivity tests. The
antibiotics have to be given for 3-6 weeks or
even more till 
the patient becomes afebrile,
WBC count returns to normal, drainage
reduces to less than 100 ml/day and there
is radiological clearance. The antibiotics
used are a combination of Beta-lactam
aminoglycoside and metronidazole.
Intercostal 
drainage: Continuous intercostal 
drainage with a tube may be required till the 
patient is afebrile, lung expansion is full and 
WBC count returns to normal. 
Intrapleural thrombolytic agents like streptokinase 
diluted in l O ml saline breaks down the loculation 
and improves drainage. 
Thoracostomy with decortication. 
Video Assisted Thoracic Surgery. 
Open drainage and rib resection. 
4 > Collapse / Atelectasis of 
Lung������­
Definition 
It is defined as airlessness with shrinkage of the lung 
which may be secondary to obstruction, compression, 
contraction or surfactant loss. Failure of the lung to 
expand at birth is called atelectasis neonatorum. 
Classification 
l.Acute or chronic -depending on rapidity of
development of collapse.
2.Partial or total -depending on the degree of
collapse.

side, dry cough, breathlessness and fever. 
Presence of symptoms depends on: 
A.Amount of the lung involved.
B.Rapidity with which it occurs.
C.Presence or absence of infection
II.Signs: Refer Table 4.4, Pg. 134
III.Investigations
1. X-Ray chest
2. a.Opacity of the involved segment or lobe
producing silhouette sign
i.Middle lobe or lingular collapse
producing blurring of Right or left
heart border.
ii.Upper lobe collapse causing blurring
of superior mediastinal border.
Luftsichel sign -In case of complete
upper ·1obe collapse hyperinflation
of apical segment of lower lobe
restores the silhouette of mediastinal
boundaries.
iii.Lower lobe atelectasis does not
obliterate cardiac borders (negative
silhouette sign) and causes a
retrocardiac shadow. Superior
triangle sign -Lower lobe collapse
resulting in para -tracheal opacity
due to displacement of superior
mediastinal structure.
iv.Double Lesion Sign : Results from
collapse of two segments or lobes,
which cannot be explained by one site
of obstruction. It is useful to exclude
a malignancy.
b.Signs ofloss oflung volume
i.Shift ofhilum.
ii.Shift of Trachea or Mediastinum.
iii.Elevation ofhemi-diaphgram
iv.Crowding of bronchi/ blood vessels.
c.Hyperinflation of rest of lung.

6 Pneumothorax 
Definition: Pneumothorax refers to air within the 
pleural space. 
Causes 
A.Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax (PSP)
It is a pneumothorax that occurs without a
precipitating event in a person who does not have
known lung disease. Usually most individuals
with PSP have unrecognized lung disease, with
the pneumothorax resulting from rupture of a
subpleural bleb.
Risk Factors
1.Smoking: Cigarette smoking is a significant
risk factor. Respiratory bronchiolitis, a form
of airway inflammation associated with
cigarette smoking, may contribute to the
development and recurrence of PSP.
2.Family history : Autosomal dominant,
autosomal recessive, polygenic, and
X-linked recessive inheritance mechanisms
have all been proposed. The autosomal
dominant Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome,
which predisposes patients to benign skin
tumors and renal cancer, is associated with
an increased incidence of PSP.
3.Other: Marfansyndrom e, Homocystinuria.
B.Secondary Spontaneous Pneumothorax ( SSP)
It is defined as a pneumothorax that occurs as
a complication of underlying lung disease.
Etiologies
1.Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease:
50 to 70 percent of SSP is attributed to
COPD. Rupture of apical blebs is the usual
cause.
2.Cystic Fibrosis : Usually due to rupture of
149 

apical subpleural cysts. Factors associated 
with an increased risk of pneumothorax 
include infection with Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa or Aspergillus species or a prior 
episode of massive hemoptysis. 
3.Lung Malignancy : Both primary and
metastatic lung malignancy have been
associated with SSP. The mechanism
is endobronchial obstruction with air
trapping.
4.Necrotizing Pneumonia : SSP can
complicate the course of necrotizing
pneumonia due to bacterial infection,
Pneumocystis jirovecii, tuberculosis, and
less 
often fungi.
a.Bacterial Pneumonia : SSP has been
associated with bacterial pneumonias
caused by Staphylococcus, Klebsiella,
Pseudomon as, Streptococcus
pneumoni ae, and anaerobic
organisms. Extension of bacterial
infection 
into the pleura can lead to
development of empyema.
b.Pneumoc ystis jirovecii : The
pathogenesis of SSP in PCP is likely
alveolar and pleural tissue invasion
and rupture oflarge subpleural cysts
that are caused by tissue necrosis.
c.Tuberculosis : The pneumothorax is
usually due to rupture ofa tuberculous
cavity into the pleural space.
5.Catamenial Pneumothorax : Refers to a
pneumothorax occurring in association
with menses due to thoracic endometriosis
6.Less Common Causes : Ankylosing
spondylitis , asthma, histiocytosis
X, interstitial lung disease (eg,
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis),
lymphangioleiomyoma tosis, Marfan
syndrome, metastatic sarcoma, rheumatoid
arthritis, and sarcoidosis.
III.Traumatic and Iatrogenic
150 A.Penetrating wounds: Stab wounds, fractured
ribs, crush injury.
B.Non-penetrating wounds: Steering wheel
impact against the drivers' chest.PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
C.Iatrogenic: Central line insertion, surgery,
lung biopsy, faulty tracheostomy.
IV.Artificial: It was induced in the past for severe
tuberculosis (At present this is obsolete because
of antituberculosis drugs).
Types 
1.Simple or closed Pneumothorax: The opening in
the lung 
is very small and heals rapidly. Therefore,
there is no continuous communication between
the lung and the pleural cavity. The pleural
pressure on the affected side remains sub­
atmospheric. A simple pneumothorax usually
has only modest repercussions unless the
patient has limited respiratory reserve or is
being mechanically ventilated. Radiographically,
simple pneumothoraces tend to be small and
without mediastinal shift to the contralateral
side.
2.Open Pneumothorax : The opening between
the lung and the pleural cavity remains patent.
Pressure in the pleural cavity is equal to that
of the atmosphere. It occurs when a traumatic
chest wall defect persists, through which air
enters the pleural space during inspiration {ie, a
"sucking wound"). As 
a result, the mediastinum
shifts toward the normal side during inspiration
and the lung on the 
injured side remains
collapsed. During expiration, air 
exits the pleural
space through the chest wall defect and the
mediastinum swings back. Expiratory air from
the normal lung (ie, "pendulum air") fills the
collapsed lung. The "mediastinal flutter" may
cause respiratory failure. Radiographically, an
open pneumothorax is characterized by a visible
chest wall defect and by expiratory mediastinal
shift towards the injured side.
3.Tension Pneumothorax : The opening between
the lung and the pleural caity is "valvular" -air
can enter the pleural cavity during inspiration
but cannot escape during expiration. Therefore,
a positive pressure 
(exceeding atmospheric
pressure) occurs on the affected side. This
rapidly leads to respiratory failure and a is a
medical emergency. Radiographically, tension
pneumothorax shows a distinct shift of the
mediastinum to the contralateral side.

{ 4 Respiratory System 
4.Others:
a.Pneumothorax ex vacuo : This rare type
of pneumothorax forms adjacent to an 
atelectatic lobe. It is seen preferentially with
atelectasis of the right upper lobe and is
the result of rapid atelectasis producing an
abrupt decrease in the intrapleural pressure
with subsequent release of nitrogen from
pleural capillaries. Treatment consists
of bronchoscopy rather than chest tube
drainage. Radiographically, pneumothorax
ex vacuo is suggested when an atelectatic
lobe or lung, particularly right upper
lobe atelectasis, is surrounded by a focal
pneumothorax.
b.Bilateral Postoperative Pneumothorax:
Bilateral pneumothoraces are seen
after cardiac surgery, particularly in
recipients of heart-lung transplants.
They are a consequence of extensive
mediastinal dissection allowing a
unilateral pneumothorax to propagate
to the contralateral hemithor ax. A
single thoracostomy tube is able to
evacuate both pleural cavities. This type of
pneumothorax has been dubbed "buffalo
chest;· since these animals have pleural
spaces that communicate anteriorly and,
as a result, they are susceptible to bilateral
pneumothorax .
Conditions Mimicking Pneumothorax 
l.Bullae : Large subpleural bullae can mimic
a loculated pneumothorax . Both bullae and
pneumothoraces usually have a straight or
convex pleural contour laterally, but only bullae
typically have a medial border that is concave to
the chest wall.
2.Trauma : Herniated Stomach following trauma
Diagnosis 
Symptoms 
1.Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP)
usually occurs when the patient is at rest. Patients
are typically in their early 20s, with PSP being
rare after age 40.Fig 4 29: Bilateral pneumothorax 
2.Symptoms due to SSP are generally more severe
than those associated with PSP, presumably
because patients with SSP have less pulmonary
reserve due to underlying lung disease.
3.Sudden onset of dyspnea and pleuritic chest
pain. The severity of the symptoms is primarily
related to the volume of air in the pleural space.
4.Evidence oflabored breathing and hemodynamic
compromise (eg, tachycardia, hypotension)
suggests a possible tension pneumothorax, which
necessitates emergency decompression.

Main 
Features :
i.Hyper translucency between lung and
thoracic cage.
ii.Razor sharp border of the collapsed lung
(white visceral pleural line).
iii.Shift of mediastinum to the opposite side.
A pneumothorax may be identified on an upright, 
supine, or lateral decubitus chest radiograph. 
The lateral decubitus view tends to be the most 
sensitive, while the supine view is the least 
sensitive. 
Upright 
i.Most pleural gas accumulates in an
apicolateral location.
ii.The visceral pleural line appears either
straight or convex towards the chest wall.
iii.As little as 50 mL of pleural gas may be
visible on a chest radiography.
iv.The collapsed lung preserves its
transradiancy because hypoxic
vasoconstriction diminishes the blood
flow to the collapsed lung.
Supine 
i.Most pleural air accumula tes in a
subpulmonic location.
ii.Gas in this location outlines the anterior
pleural reflection, the costophrenic sukus
(creating the "deep sulcus" sign), and the
antero\ateral border of the mediastinum
. In rare instances, pleural gas can also
accumulate in the phrenicove rtebral sukus.
iii.The visceral pleural line may be seen at the
Jung base and has a concave contour.
iv.Approximately 500 ml of pleural gas
are needed for definitive diagnosis
of a pneumothorax on a supine chest
radiograph.
v.The transradiancy and size of the entire
hemithorax may be increased on the side
of a pneumothorax.
vi.A hydropneumothorax in a supine patient-

lt, 
h. 
st can produce a veil-like opacity, more 
opaque than a pure pneumothorax and 
less opaque than a pure hydrothorax . 
Lateral decubitus 
i.A pneumothorax can be most easily
detected with a lateral decubitus view. In
this position, most pleural airaccumulates
in the non-dependent lateral location.
ii.The visceral pleural line appears either
straight or convex towards the chest wall.
iii.As little as 5 mL of pleural air may be visible
on a lateral decubitus chest radiograph.
,t 2.Computed Tomography 
11 This is the most accurate imaging modality for 
the detection of pneumothorax. Even small 
amounts ofintrapleural gas, atypical collections 
of pleural gas, and loculated pneumothoraces can 
be identified by CT. In addition, complex pleural 
pathology ( eg, pleural effusion, pneumothorax) 
can be optimally displayed by CT scanning. 
Pleural interventional procedures are also 
facilitated by CT guidance. 
3.Ultrasound : Ultrasound of the chest is
sometimes used to evaluate situations in which
the diagnosis must be made emergently at the
bedside, such as an ICU patient or a trauma
patient in the emergency department, so-called
point-of-care ultrasound.
In the presence of a pneumothorax, smooth,
horizontal echogenic lines are seen above and
below the pleural line and there is absence of
lung sliding and B lines.
Treatment 
Initial management is directed at removing air from the 
pleural space, with subsequent management directed 
at preventing recurrence. 
Initial management : The choice of procedure depends 
on patient characteristics and clinical circumstances: 
l.If cardio-respiratory embarressment:
a.Supplemental oxygen
b.Treatment of shock
c.Aspiration of pneumothorax:
Chest Tube Insertion (Tube 
Thoractostomy) or 2. With the patient in sitting position, a 
Needle ( 14 guage) is inserted into the 
pleural cavity in the second space in 
the mid-davicular line or in the fifth 
space in the axillary line. The other 
end of the needle is connected to the 
underwater seal. 
If there is no cardiorespiratory embarrasment 
a.If pneumothorax is small (:::;: 3 cm between
lung and chest wall): Supplemental oxygen
and observation.
b.If pneumothorax is large(> 3 cm between
lung and chest wall):
i.Needle Aspiration.
ii.Tube Thoracostomy (Chest Tube
Insertion) : if needle aspiration fails.
iii.Thoracoscopy (VATS): See below.
iv.Chemical Pleurodesis : If air leak
persists.
c.R e c u r r e n t P n e u m o t h o r a x
Hydropneumoth orax : Chest Tube
insertion and Thoracoscopy. Chemical
Pleurodosis may be performed.
Supplemental oxygen : administered to facilitate 
resorption of the pleural air. 
Aspiration : Aspiration is most easily accomplished 
with a commercially available thoracentesis kit. Once 
no more air can be aspirated, the catheter can be 
removed or left in place attached to a one-way valve 
(Heimlich Valve). 
Tube thoracostomy : Chest tube (:0:22 Fr) or chest 
catheter (:514 Fr) is connected to a water seal device, 
with or without suction and left in position until the 
pneumothorax resolves. The chest tube can be removed 
if the pneumothorax has not reaccumulated. 
Thoracoscopy : Video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) 
-With this procedure, pleurodesis is created by pleural
abrasion or a partial parietal pleurectomy; when neces­
sary, an endoscopic stapler can be used to resect bullae.
Persistent air leak : A more aggressive approach is 
needed if an air leak persists after three days. For 
patients whose lung has expanded >90%. 
A Heimlich valve can be attached to the chest 
tube. 
153 

Autologous blood or tube can be infused into 
the pleural space for chemical pleuradesis 
•Performing video-assisted thoracoscopy to
oversew the area ofleak and perform mechanical
pleurodesis.
Failure of lung reexpansion : For patients who have 
a persistent air leak and whose lung is less than 90 
percent expanded, the preferred procedure is VATS. 
Recurrence prevention 
a.Pleurodesis via VATS or chemical pleurodesis via
tube thoracostomy (talc, bleomycin, tetracyclin
derivatives like doxycycline or autologus blood
can be used).
b. 
C. 
7 Thoracotomy : The indications for open
thoracotomy are the same as those for VATS.
Thoracotomy is presently recommended only if
thoracoscopy is unavailable or has 
failed. During
thoracotomy, apical pleural blebs are oversewn
and the pleura is scarified.
Smoking cessation: may help prevent recurrent
pneumothoraces.
Pulmonary 
Cavity 
Definition: Pulmonar y cavity is an area ofliquefaction 
necrosis within the lung parenchyma in communica­
tion with the bronchus. The cavity may remain empty 
or may be filled with secretions or infected material. 
Pseudo cavity is appearance of a cavity radiologically 
which may be obtained with summation shadows of 
vessels, ribs and calcifications.

carcinoma Treatment 
Curative treatment is achieved by surgical resection. 
If the tumour has spread, palliation can be achieved 
by radiotherapy and chemotherap y. 
I. Surgery
Few patients are treatable by surgery. Even if the
tumour is localized, results of surgery are poor
in undifferentiated and poorly differentiated
tumours, whereas in squamous cell carcinoma
5-year survival is as high as 50%.
Before surgery, staging of the tumour and
pulmonary function tests (PFT) should be
done. If PFT is poor there is high risk of post­
operative complications and surgery is usually
not considered.
II.Radiotherapy
It is not curativ�, but useful to relieve
distressing complications like superior vena
cava obstruction, hemoptysis and pain caused
by chest wall invasion or skeletal metastasis.
Undifferentiated and poorly differentiated
tumours are more susceptible to radiothera py. 
III.Chemotherapy
Combination chemotherapy of 6 cycles at 3
weeks interval consisting of the following drugs
is useful:
l.Doxorubicin 60 mg/sq.m. IV bolus-Day I
2.Cyclophosphamide 750 mg/sq.m. IV
infusion-Day I
3.Etoposide 120 mg/sq.m. IV infusion •
Day l
They are useful in good prognosis group of 
patients (Age <70 years, Normal albumin and 
sodium and weight loss <10%). 
In poor prognosis group, oral etoposide, 50 mg 
12 hourly for 10 days every 3 weeks for 6 cycles 
offers good palliation. 
In general, chemotherapy is less effective in 
non-small cell bronchial carcinomas. 
IV.Laser therapy
Laser therapy via fiberoptic bronchoscope
destroys the tumour tissue occluding the main
bronchi and allows re-aeration of collapsed lung.
It is essentially palliative.

9 Pulmonary Tuberculosis 
Tubercle bacilli gain entry into the body usually by
inhalation or ingestion. Rarely they may gain entry
through the skin, tonsils, conjunctiva and external geni­
talia. Sputum of the infectious patient is the commonest
source of tubercle bacilli. The bacilli are scattered in
the atmosphere mainly by coughing. (A single cough
expels up to 40,000 tubercle bacilli). Droplets of sputum
containing the bacilli may be inhaled directly by those
in the vicinity or they may fall on the ground and mix
with dust. When the ground is swept, the bacilli rise
with the dust and may be inhaled. A sputum positive
patient infects upto 25 
persons / year.
Primary 
Pulmonary Tuberculosis 
Pathogenesis: On inhalation, the tubercle bacilli reach
the respiratory bronchioles and alveoli where they are
taken up by the macrophages. These macro-phages
may carry the tubercle bacilli elsewhere. Within the
macrophages, the tubercle bacilli may 
multiply. 
After about 3-8 weeks the individual develops a hy­
persensitivity to tuberculoprotein through specific
modification of thymus dependent lymphocytes. At
this 
time the following changes occur: 
1.Tuberculin test becomes positive. 
2.Macrophages may rupture releasing tubercle
bacilli. 
3.Granulomatous lesion (tubercle) may form.
It consists of: 
a.Epithelioid cells derived from macrophages.
b.Langhans giant cells also derived from
macrophages.
c.Lymphocytes. 
d.Central caseation due to cheesy type of
necrosis: Caseous tissues may liquefy to
become purulent material, which may be
discharged into the air spaces, or it may be
calcified. 
A number of such tubercles may merge to form an
area of pneumonitis ( which is commonly subpleural).
The lymphatics draining this area of pneumonitis may
become involved and a chain of tubercles may be seen
along these lymphatics 
going towards the hilar lymph
nodes, which also become caseousand enlarged. This is
158 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
called the PRIMARY COMPLEX (Ghon'sComplex}.
In the first few months following the primary infection,
the tubercle bacilli can enter the lymphatics and from
there the blood stream via the thoracic duct. Usu­
ally primary 
infection is seen in infants or children.
Younger children have greater chances of progression
of tuberculosis and developing its complications.
Primary Complex Consists of: 
I.Subpleural TB 
2.Hilar Lymphadenopathy
3.Draining Lymphatics 
4.Right 
middle lobe collapse (Brock's syndrome):
rare and seen mainly in children.
Classification 
I.GHON'S focus -subpleural (lung) 
2.Ashman's focus -deep apical 
( lung) 
3.Simmons focus -subpleural upper lobe focus
4.Cerebral -Rich's focus 
5.Blood vessel -([ntima) Wigard's focus
6.Liver -Simmonds focus 
7.Primary splenic, intestinal, primary lymph node
focus.

3.It may actively progress merging into post·
primary 
pulmonary tuberculosis.
4.It may lead to hematogenous spread of tubercle
bacilli leading to miliary tuberculosis or
tuberculous meningitis.
Clinical Features 
A.Symptoms
1.There may be no symptoms
2.Fever for a brief period, which is often
passed off as influenza. 
Evening rise of
temperature.
3.Anorexia and weight loss
4.Cough and wheeze due to pressure oflymph
nodes on bronchi
B.Signs
1.There may be no detectable physical sign.
2.General debility: A thin, pale, 
fretful child
with loss of skin elasticity and less glossy
hair.
3.Local areas of rales or rhonchi.
C.Radiology
In adults the pulmonary component is more
obvious, whereas in children the glandular
component is more obvious.
Radiological findings are:
1.Soft confluent shadow (suggesting
exudative process)
2.Linear shadow (suggesting fibrosis)
3.Cavity: Initially irregular, later smooth
walled

Complications 
A.Pulmonary:
I.Epituberculosis: Dense homogenousdensity involving complete lobe yet the 
general 
condition of the patient is good. 
Prognosis is excellent. It may be due to 
inflammatory exudate, collapse or caseous 
pneumonia. 
2.Bronchiectasis
3.Obstructive emphysema
4.Pleural effusion
B.Allergic
I.Erythema nodosum
2.Phlyctenular conjunctivitis
C.Due to hematogenous spread
I.Miliary tuberculosis
2.TB meningitis
3.Tuberculosis of bone, joints, kidneys and
skin, any organ.
Post-primary Pulmonary Tuberculosis 
Pathogenesis 
Post-primary pulmonary tuberculosis may 
rise in any 
one of the four ways: 
1.Direct progression of primary lesion
2.Reactivation of the primary lesion when the
individual's defenses have waned
3.Hematogenous spread of the disease from the
primary focus
4.Exogenous superinfection with drug resistant
bacilli.
The lesions of 
reinfection have the same basic tubercu­
lar pathology. H yperallergy and immunity acquired as 
a result of first infection exert two opposing influences. 
As a result of hyper allergy there is a considerable tis­
sue destruction and as a result of immunity there is a 
constant attempt at healing by localization and fibrosis. 
There is no tendency ofinvolveme nt of draining glands. 
When the immunity is high, exudative lesions are re­
placed by fibrotic lesions giving a nodular appearance. 
The lesions spread along the peribronchial lymphatics 
giving a typical X-ray appearance ofinfiltration -patchy 
opacities interspersed with normal parenchyma. In 
healing, the peribronchial granulation tissue is replaced 
by fibrosis, which leads to dilatation of bronchi by 
traction (post-tuberculous bronchiectasis). 
159 

When immunity is low and the tempo of activity high, 
tuberculous material may be aspirated through the 
bronchi into other parts of the same or the opposite 
lung producing fresh lesions. The caseous material 
liquefies and discharges into a bronchus so that a cavity 
forms. Cavity is a favorable breeding ground for the 
tubercle bacilli. (Caseous material has l x 10·1 bacilli 
/ gm, Cavity has 1 x 10�). 
The common sites of tuberculous lesion are the poste­
rior segment of the upper lobe or the apical segment of 
the lower lobe. This is mostly due to decreased blood 
flow and relatively good ventilation of the upper lobe 
in the upright position. 
Clinical Features 
Symptoms

5. Due to toxemia: General symptoms such as 
fever with evening rise of temperature, night 
sweats, anorexia, weight loss, tiredness and 
mental symptoms like irritability and difficulty 
in concentration. 
Local symptoms: These are caused by the disease 
process in the lungs. The symptoms include 
cough with expectoration, pleuritic chest pain 
breathlessness and hemoptysis. 
Indirect symptoms: Indigestion and dyspepsia 
due to stimulation of parasympathetic fibers. 
Amenorrhea often occurs in a young woman even 
without direct involvement of the reproductive 
organs. 
Symptoms from complications

Regimen -2 mths of HRZE followed by 4 
mths of HR [No dose adjustment of H&R 
required as they have biliary excretion. 
There is significant renal excretion ofETB 
and metabolities of P ZA so dose adjustment 
is required]. 
[ STM avoided as there is increased risk of 
ototoxicity). 
Note : All patients receiving Isoniazide, should receive 
pyridoxine supplementation to prevent peripheral 
neuropathy. 
Management of Previously Treated Patients 
Previous TB treatment is a strong determinant of drug 
resistance and previously treated patients comprise 
13% of the Global TB. 
Drug Resistant Tuberculosis is defined as a case of 
tuberculosis who are excreting bacilli resistant to one 
or more anti-tubercular drugs. 
Multidrug Resistant -TB (MDR -TB) is defined 
as disease due to M. tuberculosis that is resistant to 
Isoniazid and Rifampicin with or without resistance 
to other drugs. 
XDR -TB: MDR strains that are resistant to all fluo­
roquinolones and to atleast one of three second line 
injectable agents.

Monitoring during treatment 
To Ensure cure, compliance. To monitor side effects 
A.Sputum smear microscopy in New Sputum Positive
Pulmonary TB patients:
1.For smear positive pulmonary TB patients
treated with first line drugs, sputum
smear microscopy may be performed at
completion ofintensi ve phase of treatment.
2.If smear -positive at month 2, { i.e. intensive
phase) obtain sputum smear again at month
3.If smear remains positive at month 3,
obtain culture and DST.
3.Smear or Culture positivity at the fifth
month or later ( or detection of MDR -TB
at any point) is defined as treatment failure
and necessitates re-registration and change
of treatment.
B.Sputum smear microscopy in previously treated
patients.

1.Recheck sputum smear at end of2 months
and if negative, no further sputum
monitoring is required.
2.Clinical monitoring is more importnat -
Body Weight is the most useful indicator.

Management of drug -induced hepatitis 
H, R, Zcan all cause liver damage. Rifampicin can cause 
asymptomatic jaundice without evidence of hepatitis. 
Management depends on 
a.Whether patient is in intensive or continuation
phase.
b.Severity ofliver disease
c.Severity of TB
d.Capacity of Health Care Unit to manage side
effects.
Treatment 
l.All drugs should be stopped. If patient is severly
ill, non-hepatotixc regimen of streptomycin,
ethambutol and fluoroquinolone should be
started.

4. It is necessary to wait for LFT to revert to 
normal and clinical symptoms to resolve before
re-introducing anti-TB drugs. If not possible to
perform LFT, advisable to wait for extra 2 weeks
after resolution of jaundice and upper abdominal
pain/ tenderness before restarting TB treatment.
If hepatotoxicity does not resolve, non
hepatotoxic regimen consisting of STM, ETB,

7. the drugs are reintroduced, the last drug added 
should be stopped. It is advised to start with 
Rifampicin because it is less likely than H or Z 
to cause hepatotoxicity and is the most effective 
agent. After 3-7 days H may be reintroduced. 
Alternative regimen dependin g on drug 
implicated: 
a.If 'R' is implicated : 2 months of SHE
followed by 10 months of HE.
b.Jf'H' is implicated : 6-9 months ofRZE.
c.If'Z' is implicated : 9 months of HR.
d.If neither R or H can be used: 18-24 mths
STM, ET and tluoroquinotine.
When hepatitis with Jaundice occurs during the 
intensive phase of TB treatment with HRZE -
once hepatitis has resolved, restart the same 
drugs except replace 'Z' with 'S' to complete the 
2 months course of initial therapy, followed by 
R&H for 6 month continuation phase 
When hepatitis with Jaundice occurs during the 
continuation phase: Once hepatitis has resolved, 
restart 'H' & 'R" to complete the 4 -month 
continuation phase of treatment. 
Treatment of MDR-TB 
Once MDR-TB is confirmed, patients can be treated 
with: 
a.Standard MDR regimen (Standardized
approach); OR
b.An individually tailored regimen, based on DST
of additional drugs
General principles of designing MDR regimen 
1.Use at least 4 drugs certain to be effective (Each
drug from different class).
2.Do not use drugs for which there is possibility
of cross resistance.
3. Eliminate drugs that are not safe.
4.Include drugs from Groups 1-5 in a hierarchical
order based on potency. [For regimens
containing fewer than 4 drugs, consider adding
group 5 drugs. Regimen often contains 5-7
drugs).

tapered over the next 2-3 weeks. They are to be 
given only under the cover of anti-tuberculous 
therapy, otherwise there may be flaring up of 
tuberculosis. 
10 > Chronic Obstructive 
Pulmonary Disease 
(COPD) (Emphysema 
and Chronic Bronchitis) 
Definition 
Emphysema is characterized by enlargement of the 
airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles, either 
from dilatation 
or destruction of their walls. 
Chronic bronchi tis is di nically defined as chronic cough 
with expectoration for three months for two consecu­
tive years, with other known causes being ruled out. 

{ 4 ) Respiratory System
COPD is a common preventable and treatable disease, 
characterized by progressive airflow limitation associ­
ated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response 
to noxious particles or gases. 
Exacerbations and comorbidit ies contribute to overall 
severity on individual patients.

Prevalence 
I.Higher in smokers than non smokers
2.Higher in those over age 40
3.Higher in men than women.
Risk factors influencing disease 
development and prognosis 
A. Genetic predisposition :
B. l.a-1 Antitrypsin gene
2.MMP 12 gene
3.a-nicotine ACh receptor
4.Hedge Hog interactivity protein gene
Environmental factors 
1.Age: Ageing itselfis a risk factor for COPD.
2.Gender: In past prevalence was more in
men than women. But due to increase in
smoking in women prevalence rates are
now approaching equality.
3.Lung growth and development
a.Any factor that affects lung growth
during Gestation and childhood has
potential for increasing individual
risk for COPD.
b.Factors in early life termed "Childhood
Disadvantage Factors" were as
important as heavy smoking is in
predicting in early adult life.
4.Exposure to Particles
a.Cigarette smoke
b.Other types of tobacco (e.g. pipe,cigar, water pipe) and maijuana are 
also risk factor. 
c.Passive exposure to smoke -also
known as environmental tobacco
smoke.
d.Smoking during pregnancy affects
fetus by affecting lung growth and
development of immune system.
e.Occupational exposures, including
organic and inorganic dust and
chemical agents and fumes are
appreciated risk factors.
f.Wood, Animal during, crop residues
and coal, typically burned in open
fires or poorly functioning stoves or
heating in poorly ventilated dwelling
-important risk factor.
g.Outdoor air pollution -in urban areas.
Role is unclear, but is small compared
to smoking. Air pollution from fossil
fuel combustion is associated with
decrement in lung function.
5.Socio economic status: Poverty is clearly a
risk factor but the components of poverty
that contribute to this are unclear. Risk is
inversely related to socioeconomic state.
6.Asthma I Bronchial hyper reactivity :
a.Asthma may be a risk factor but
evidence is not conclusive.
b.Bronchial hyper reactivity can
exist without clinical diagnosis of
asthma and has been shown to be an 
important predictorof COPD as well
as an indicator of increased risk of
decline in lung function in patients
with mild COPD.
7.Infection
a. Severe childhood respiratory infection
has been associated with reduced lung
function and increased respiratory
symptoms in adulthood.
b.Susceptibility to infection plays an
important role in exacerbation of
COPD but effect on development of
disease in less clear.

Diagnosis 
A.General condition: Patient may be emaciated,
cyanosed and edematous (blue bloater). JVP
may show giant a-waves.
B.Chest findings: Refer Pg. 134
C.Heart
1.Apex beat may not be visible or palpable.
2.Right ventricular heave may be present.
3.Heart sounds may be diminished. Second
sound may be loud. Gallop rhythm may
be present. In marked emphysema, RV
heave may not be visible or felt because
the hyperinflated lung may cover it. In
such cases, epigastric pulsations may be
the only evidence of RV enlargement
4.Functional tricuspid regurgitation murmur
may be present.
5.Hyperkinetic state with warm limbs and
Waterhammer pulse may be present.
D.Miscellaneous
170 l.Liver may be enlarged.
2.Optic disc may show papilledema.PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
Investigations 
A.Spirometry : Presence of post bronchodilator
FEY 1 / FVC < 0.7 confirms the presence of
persistent airflow limitation and thus ofCOPD.
It is also used to grade the severity of COPD
(given below).

performance has shown to be a better predictor of 
prognosis than only spirometry. 
Treatment 
J.Of acute Exacerbation
An acute event is characterised by worsening of
patients respirator y symptoms that is beyond
normal day to day variantions or leads to a
change in medication. Frequent exacerbations
are those occuring > twice a year.
It is precipitated by inection, allergic reactions,
other systemic illness or air pollution.
A.Chemotherapy: Antibiotics are required as
infection often precipitates acute attacks.
One of the following drugs may be used:
IfH. influenza, streptococci, staphylococci
or Klebsiella is the cause:
1.Benzyl penicillin 10 lakh units6 hourly
with streptomycin 0.5 gm 12 hourly.
Fig 4.40 Emphysema 
Table 4.22: Gold C riteria 2.Ampicillin 0.5 gm 6 hourly.
3.Chloramphenicol 0.5 gm 6 hourly.
If there is Pseudomonas infection the 
following drugs may be used: 
1.Gentamicin 80 mg 8 hourly l.M. or
2.Ciprofloxacin 0.5 gm 6 hourly orally
or 200 mg IV 12 hourly.
3.Ceftazidime l gm IV 6 hourly.
B.Oxygen Therapy : This is required to attain
adequate oxygenation. However, in some
patients with chronic obstructive airway
disease and hypercapnia, the respiratory
centre would have lost its normal sensitivity
to carbon dioxide and would become
dependent on the hypoxic drive to
maintain respiration. In such cases oxygen
must be given with care and preferably
intermittently (Refer Chapters 7 and 11).
C.Bronchodilators: Aminophylline 0.25·
0.5 gm. LV. slowly not only relaxes the
bronchial muscles but also stimulates the
respiratory centre and assists in clearing the
respiratory tract. Salbutamol inhalations
are also useful as they are selective beta
stimulants.
D.Corticosteroids: The role of corticosteroids
in acute exacerbations is uncertain.
E.For cor pulmonale: If the patient is in cor
pulmonale, diuretics like furosemide,
digitalis and potassium salts must be given.
F.Avoiding bronchial irritants: Smoking must
be avoided. Atmospheric pollution too
must be avoided, but it may not be practical.

However patient must stay indoors in foggy 
weather and sleep with dosed windows. 
G.Expectorants and mucolytic agents: A hot
drink 
acts as a simple expectorant in
clearing the airways. Bromhexine has been
found useful in liquefying sputum and
aiding airway clearance.
H.Chest physiotherapy: Postural drainage
and proper breathing exercises, especially
expiration, must be taught to the patient.

(IPF).
Pathology Pathophysiology: Bronchiectasis is usually bilateral 
and commonly affects the lower lobes. The two main 
factors responsible for bronchiectasis are: 1. Destruction & Dilatation of walls of medium sized
airways at level of segmental or subsegmental
bronchi; and small airway inflammation.
2.Loss of elastic, smooth muscle and cartilage and
replaced by fibrous tissue.
3.Dilated airways contain pools of thick, purulent
material; while peripheral airways occluded by
176 I.Infection: Infection causes chronic inflamma­
tory changes in the bronchial walls. This destroys
themuscular elastictissuesin the bronchi, which
results in dilatation of the bronchi.
2.Obstruction: Results in collapse of the small
bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli. There may be

( 4 ) Respiratory System 
accumulation of secretions, secondary infection 
and further weakening of the bronchial wall 
which is pulled apart due to negative pressure 
and this results in permanen t dilatation of the 
bronchi. 
Types 
I.Saccular or cystic: affects major or proximal
bronchi that end in large sacs by the fourth
generation of branching
II.Cylindrical or fusiform: affects sixth to eighth
generation of bronchi, probably less severe,
clinically "dry"
III.Varicose: intermediate between saccular and
cylindrical
Clinical Features 
Symptoms 
1.Persistent productive cough with ongoing thick,
tenacious sputum production/ purulent sputum.
2.Hemoptysis (40-70%) -due to bleeding from
friable, inflammed airway mucosa; massive
hemoptysis often due to bleeding from
hypertrophied bronchial artery.
3.Bronchiectasis sicca -Patients are either
asymptomatic or have a non productive cough
associated with Dry Bronchiectsis of upper lobe.
4.Dyspnoea & wheezing -Reflects widespread
parenchymal destruction or COPD.
5.Systemic symptoms -fatigue, wieght loss,
myalgias.
6.Acute Exacerbation -(a) amount of sputum
increases; (b) sputum becomes more purulent
and often more bloody; (c) systemic symptoms
like fever may be more prominent.

Pathophysiology 
Lung abscess is more common in the right lung. It is a 
solid yellow mass of inflammator y tissue surrounded by 
necrotic wall. As the disease progresses, the solid mass 
may be transformed to liquid pus. Microscopic-ally 
it 
consists of dense infiltration of polymorpho-nuclear 
leucocytes. Alveolar walls are destroyed. 
Clinical Features 
It presents within l - 2 weeks. 
Symptoms 
l.Onset: Insidious, acute or chronic
2.Cough: Most common feature with copious
expectoration of foul smelling, greenish yellow
and mucopurulent sputum. It may be 
rusty and
blood-stained.
3.Pyrexia: High remittent fever 
with shivering
and sweating
4.Chest Pain: Pleuritic pain if pleural surfaces
involved
5.Generalized symptoms: malaise, lassitude, loss
of weight, anorexia
Signs 
1.Temperature: Very high with tachycardia
2.Clubbing of fingers3.Dullness on percussion & few coarse
crepitations during early phase
4.Signs of cavity or local consolidation may occur
when pus is expectorated out
5.Signs of pleural effusion may mask other signs
Investigations 
l.CBC: Polymorphonuclear leucocytes
2.Sputum: Pus cells, causative organisms on
staining and culture.
3.Chest X-ray: Large homogenous opacity or
a cavity showing a fluid level may be seen.
Associated involvement of pleura may be noted
by obliteration of CP angle.
4.Fiberoptic bronchoscopy: to rule out
bronchogenic cause oflung abscess
5.CT Scan if necessary
Complications 
1.Dry pleurisy
2.Empyema
3.Pneumothorax
4.Brain abscess
5.Hemoptysis
Treatment 
I.Chemotherapy: Appropriate antimicrobial
therapy
2.Postural drainage and percussion therapy
3.Bronchoscopic aspiration
4.General measures: Bed rest, oxygen, high protein
diet, breathing exercises
5.Surgery: Surgical resection may be required if
there is no response to above measures or there
is massive hemoptysis, localized malignancy or
bronchiectasis.
Prevention 
The most common mode of acquiring lung abscess 
is following aspiration following tonsillectomy, oral 
surgery, nose-throat operations, following inhala­
tion of vomitus during general anesthesia or coma 
or iatrogenic due to intermittent positive pressure 
breathing and nebulization. Care should be taken to 
prevent all of the above.

14 Solitary Pulmonary 
Nodule (SPN) 
A SPN is a lesion that is both within and surrounded 
by pulmonary parenchyma. The size at which a nodule 
becomes a mass is arbitrary, although 3 cm is typi· 
cally used. 
Prevalence ofSPNs varied from 8 to 51 percent, usu• 
ally detected incidentally on a chest radiograph or 
computed tomographic (CT) scan 
Differential Diagnosis 
The causes of a SPN can be categorized as benign or 
malignant. 
Malignant Etiologies 
Common causes of a malignant SPN include-
!. Primary lung cancer -Adenocarcinoma(most 
common), followed by squamous cell carcinoma 
and large cell carcinoma. Rarely, lymphomas can 
present as a SPN. 
2.Carcinoid tumors -Carcinoid tumors tend to
be centrally located endobronchial lesions.
These tumors are generally well circumscribed
radiographically,
3.Metastatic cancer malignant melanoma,
sarcomas, and carcinomas of the colon, breast,
kidney, and testicle.
Benign Etiologies 
l.Infectious granulomas -cause approximately
80 percent of benign nodules . Endemic fungi
(eg, histoplasmosi s, coccidioidomycosis),
mycobacte ria (either tuberculous or
nontuberculous mycobacteria, nontuberculous
mycobacterial disease, Pneumocystis jirovecii
infection
2.Hamartomas -They cause approximately 10
percent of benign nodules.gives characteristic
appearance of a hamartoma on a chest
radiograph isaSPN with "popcorn" calcification.
3.Diro.filariasis -Pulmonary 
infestation with the
dog heartworm, 
Dirofilaria immitis, is a rare but
well-recognized cause of a SPN.
Diagnostic Evaluation 
The clinical features, radiographic features, and quan-
180 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
titative models are used to determine the likelihood 
that a nodule is malignant or not. In all cases, every 
attempt must be made to secure old imaging studies 
because size comparisons can be used to determine 
stability versus growth. 
Clinical Features 
Layer associated with an increased probability that a 
SPN is malignant include -
l.Patient age-The probability rises with increasing
patient age
2. 
3. Risk factors history of smoking, asbestos
exposure, family history, previously diagnosed
malignancy.
Radiographic features -that can be used to
predict whether a nodule is malignant include -
a.Size -Larger lesions are more likely to be
malignant than 
smaller lesions.
b.Border -Malignant lesions tend to have
more irregular and spiculated borders,
whereas benign lesions often have a
relatively smooth and discrete border.
c.Cakification-Th epresenceofcalcification
does not exclude malignancy . As an
example, "eccentric" calcification (ie,
asymmetric calcification) should raise
concern about carcinoma arising in
an old granuloma tous lesion (ie, a
"scar" carcinoma).Certain patterns of
calcification, however, strongly suggest
that a SPN is likely benign eg. "popcorn"
calcificatio
n, laminated (concentr ic)
calcification, 
central calcification , and
diffuse, homogeneous calcification
d.Density-lncreased densityofaSPN argues
against malignancy.
SPNs may have a purely 
ground glass
appearance (through which normal
parenchymal structures, including airways
and vessels, can 
be visualized). The
typical histology for a malignant SPN
with pure groun� glass morphology is
adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinomas with
a ground-glass appearance are often slow
growing, such that apparent stability over
time may be misleading,
e.Growth · Lesions that are malignant tend

< 4 ) Respiratory System 
to have a volume doubling time between 20 
and 400 days, where volume doubling of 
a nodule corresponds to an approximately 
30 percent increase in its diameter. Volume 
doubling time also varies according to the 
CT appearance of malignant SPNs. 
Management 
An initial management decision should be made 
once the probability that the SPN is malignant has 
been assessed. 
Solid solitary nodules 
l.A nodule that has clearly grown on serial imaging
tests should be biopsied or excised.
2.A solid nodule that has been stable for over two
years can be considered benign.
3.For other solid SPNs not meeting these criteria,
the risk of malignancy is determined based on the
di nician's overall impression, after consideration
of all clinical and radiographic features and is
used to guide the following choices:
a.A nodule that has a low probability of being
malignant can be followed with serial CT
scans.
b.A nodule that is smaller than I cm and
has an intermediate probability of being
malignant can be followed by serial CT
scans.
c.A nodule that is 8 to 10 mm or larger
and has an intermediate probability of
being malignant should 
be evaluated by
18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission
tomography (FDG-PET). Nodules that
are negative on FDG-PET can be followed
with serial CT scans, while nodules that are
positive should be excised
d.A nodule that has a high probability of
being malignant should be excised.
Subsolid solitary nodules Subsolid nodules may 
be purely ground glass in appearance or may have a 
combination of ground glass and solid components 
( called part-solid). A subsolid SPN should be reassessed 
in three months to confirm continued presence, as a 
portion of these will resolve spontaneously. 
a.If a subsolid SPN has increased in size or if it hasa solid component that is �5 mm in diameter, it 
should be biopsied or surgically resected. 
b.If a purely ground glass nodule is :55 mm, no
further CT follow-up is required.
c.All other subsolid SPNs need serial CT scanning
for a minimum of three years, due to the risk of
low grade adenocarcinoma, which tends to be
slow-growing.
Serial CT scans -A nodule that remained stable 
for two years or longer on a chest radiograph was 
traditionally considered benign. 
Guidelines for solid nodules 
1.For nodules :54 mm, serial CT scans are not
required if the patient is low risk. Patients who
are high risk should have a CT scan performed
at 12 months with no further follow-up if the
nodule is unchanged.
2.For nodules 4 to 6 mm, a CT scan should be
performed at 12 months if the patient is low 
risk, with no further follow-up if the nodule is 
unchanged. Patients who are high risk should
have a CT scan performed at 6 to 12 months and
at 18 to 24 months if the nodule is unchanged.
3.For nodules 6 to 8 mm, a CT scan should be 
performed at 6 to 12 months and at 18 to 24
months if the nodule is unchanged and the
patient is low risk. Patients who are high risk
should have a CT scan performed at 3 to 6
months, 9 to 12 months, and 24 months if the
nodule remains unchanged.
4.For nodules greater than 8 mm, a CT scan should
be performed at 3, 9, and 24 months if the nodule
remains unchanged, regardless of whether the
patient is low or high risk.
Guidelines for ground-glass and part-solid nod­
ules -For purely ground-glass (GG) nodules >5 
mm and for part-solid nodules, a follow -up th in -slice 
chest CT scan be obtained after a three-month interval 
and the results used to direct the following strategy -
1.A nodule that is purely GG based on thin-slice
(1 mm sections) chest CT and :55 mm in diameter
does not need further CT follow•up.
2.A GG nodule that is >5 mm in diameter is
followed by serial CT scans at 12, 24, and 36
months. If the nodule has not increased in
181 

size after 36 months of observation, the need 
for further CT monitoring is determined on a 
case-by-case basis. For patients who are suitable 
candidates for surgical resection and have a single 
GG nodule that is> 10 to 15 mm in diameter and 
persists for >3 months, we typically offer the 
option of surgical resection, as some patients 
prefer resection to the anxiety associated with 
ongoing monitoring. 
3.A part-solid nodule with a solid component <5
mm is followed by serial CT scans at 12, 24, and
36 months. If the solid component is �5 mm,
then the nodule is biopsied or resected.
FDG-PET -18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron 
emission tomography (FOG PET) can help distinguish 
malignant and benign lesions because cancers are 
metabolically active and take up FOG avidly. It is 
indicated for patients with a solid or part-solid SPN that 
is 8 to 10 mm or greater in size and has an intermediate 
probability of malignancy, especially if the patient has 
increased surgical risk. 
FDG-PET has high negative predictive value, but poor 
positive predictive value. 
An additional benefit ofFDG-PET is the acquisition 
of staging data if the nodule is malignant. 
Nodule sampling -Sampling of the nodule can be 
performed by 
1.Bronchoscopy -Fiberoptic bronchoscopy
is a reasonable approach for the diagnostic
evaluation oflarge, central nodules and masses;
however, it is much less useful for small or
peripheral SPNs. The small amount of material
provided byfiberoptic bronchoscopy is a limiting
factor:
2. 
182 •Combining cytology and fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) may improve
the sensitivity compared to cytology alone,
although the specificity is unaltered. This is
applicable to both washings and brushings.
Percutaneous needleaspiration -Percutaneous 
needle aspiration (also called fine needle 
aspiration) of a SPN can be performed through 
the chest wall using either fluoroscopy or CT 
scanning to guide placement of the needle 
within the lesion. Its diagnostic yield is higher 
than fiberoptic bronchoscopy, since placement 3. 
4. PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
of the needle is more reliable. Percutaneou s 
needle aspiration obtains material for cytology, 
but does not biopsy a core of tissue. As a result, 
it is more helpful for confirming malignanc y 
than establishing a specific benign diagnosis 
Percutaneous needle aspiration may be 
complicated by pneumothorax, which can be 
clinically significant in patients with coexisting 
emphysema. Bleeding is a less frequent 
complication. 
Percutaneous needle biopsy -. In this 
procedure, a core of tissue is obtained using a 
cutting needle. Up to 97 percent of patients with 
a malignant or benign lung nodule will obtain a 
definitive diagnosis using this procedure . 
Surgical resection -Excision can be performed 
by thoracotomy or thoracoscopy (also called 
video assisted thoracic surgery 'or VATS) if the 
lesion is located close enough to pleural surface 
to allow VATS resection. 
15 > Obstructive Sleep 
Apnoea 
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common chronic 
disorder, cardinal features of which include: 
1.Obstructive apneas, hypopneas, or respiratory
effort related arousals.
2.Daytime symptoms attributab le to disrupted
sleep, such as sleepiness, fatigue, or poor
concentration.
3.Signs of disturbed sleep, such as snoring,
restlessness, or resuscitative snorts.
Severe untreated OSA has been associated with in­
creased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. 
Risk Factors 
Definite risk factors for OSA include: 
1.Obesity
2.Craniofacial abnormalities
3.Upper airway soft tissue abnormalities
4.Heredity
5.Smoking
6.Nasal congestion:

( 4 ) Respiratory System 
Clinical Features 
History 
1.Most patients with OSA first complain of daytime
sleepiness, or the bed partner reports loud
snoring, gasping, snorting, or interruptions in
breathing while sleeping.
2.Other associated symptoms and historical
features include the following:
a.Awakening with a sensation of choking,
gasping, or smothering
b. Awakening with a dry mouth or sore throat
c.Moodiness or irritability
d. Lack of concentration
e.Memory impairment
f.Morning headaches
g.Decreased libido and impotence
h.Awakening with angina pectoris
i.History of hypertension, cardiovascular
disease, cerebrovascular disease, or renal
disease
j.History of type 2 diabetes mellitus
k.Nocturia
I.Depression
m.Symptoms of fibromyalgia.
3.Epworth Sleepiness Scale is used to quantitatively
document the patient's perception of sleepiness,
fatigue, or both.
Physical Examination 
1. 
2. 
3. OSA is most common among males who are 18 
to 60 years old, although it is also common at 
other ages and in women. 
The physical exam is frequently normal, except 
for obesity (body mass index >30 kg/m2) and a 
crowded oropharyngeal airway. 
Additional physical findings that are common 
among patients with OSA include the following: 
a.Narrow airway -Numerous conditions
causing narrowing of upper airway
include-retrognathia, micrognathia, lateral
peritonsillar narrowing, macroglo ssia,
tonsillar hypertrophy, an elongated orenlarged uvula, a high arched or narrow 
palate, nasal septa! deviation, and nasal 
polyps. 
b. Large neck and/or waist circumference -
OSA is more strongly correlated with an
increased neck size or waist circumference
than general obesity. OSA is particularly
prominent among men who have a collar
size greater than 17 inches and women who
have a collar size greater than 16 inches.
c.Elevated blood pressure -Approximately
50 percent of patients with OSA have
coexisting hypertension, which is often
most elevated in the morning.
d.Signs of pulmonary hypertension or
cor pulmonale (eg, peripheral edema,
jugular venous distension) -Pulmonary
hypertension and cor pulmonale are
common seq uelae when OSA coexists with
either obesity hypoventilation syndrome or 
an alternative cause of daytime hypoxem ia
(eg, chronic lung disease).
Diagnostic Tests 
I. 
2. 
3. Polysomnography 
Full-night, attended , in-laboratory 
polysomnography is considered the gold­
standard diagnostic test for OSA. It involves 
monitoring the patient during a full night>s sleep. 
Patients who are diagnosed with OSA and choose 
positiveairwaypressuretherapyaresubsequently 
brought back for another study, during which 
their positive airway pressure device is titrated. 
Portable monitoring -There are a variety of 
devices that are used for in-home, unattended, 
portable monitoring of cardiorespiratory 
parameters. Many have been validated against 
standard PSG, typically by testing the same 
patient with both modalities in the sleep 
laboratory. 
Laboratory Tests 
Nonspecific abnormalities related to OSA 
occasionally found are: 
l.Proteinuria -Proteinuria is not common
among patients with OSA (<10 percent
of patients) but, when it occurs, it may be
severe (ie, nephrotic range)
183 

2.Hypercapnia -often present if obesity
hypoventilation syndrome coexists.
3.Cardiac dysrhythmia -OSA is associated
with nocturnal cardiac dysrhythmias,
including bradycardia, atrial fibrillation,
and asystole
4.Hypothyroidism -Hypothyroidism may
cause or exacerbate OSA.
Diagnostic Criteria 
OSA is confirmed if either of the two conditions exists: 
1.There are 15 or more apneas, hypopneas, or
respiratory effort related arousals per hour of
sleep ( ie, an apnea hypopnea index or respiratory
disturbance index �15 events per hour) in an
asymptomatic patient. More than 75 percent of
the apneas and hypopneas must be obstructive.
2.There are five or more obstructive apneas,
obstructive hypopneas, or respiratory effort
related arousals per hour of sleep (ie, an apnea
hypopnea index or respiratory disturbance index
�5 events per hour) in a patient with symptoms or
signs of disturbed sleep. More than 75 percent of
the apneas and hypopneas must be obstructive.
Treatment 
A.Behavior Modification
184 I.Weightloss-Weightlossi mprovesoverall
health, decreases the apnea hypopnea
index, improvesquali tyoflife,and probably
decreases daytime sleepiness.
2.Exercise -modestly improves OSA even
in the absence of significant weight loss.
3.Sleep position- Non-supine position(eg.
Lateral recumbent), semi recumbent
position may be helpful.
4.Alcohol avoidance -All patients should
avoid alcohol, even during the daytime,
because it can depress the central nervous
system, exacerbate OSA, worsen sleepiness,
and promote weight gain.
5.Medication selection -Medications
that should be avoided include
medications that inhibit the central
nervous system, such as benzodiazepinesPRACTICAL MEDICINE 
and benzodiazepine receptor agonists, as 
well as barbiturates, other anti-epileptic 
drugs, antidepressants, antihistamines, and 
opiates. Antidepressants that cause weight 
gain eg, mirtazapine. 
B.Osa-Specific Therapies
1.Positive airway pressure -Positive
airway pressure splints the upper airway
open Positive airway pressure therapy is
generally considered first line therapy for
OSA. It can be delivered asT
a.Continuous positive airway pressure
(CPAP),
b.Bilevel positive airway pressure
(BPAP),
c.Autotitrat ing positive airway pressure
(APAP),
d.Adaptive servo-ventilation or end
expiratory positive airway pressure.
2.Oral appliances
Designed to either protrude the mandible
forward (ie, mandibular advancement/
repositioning splints, devices or appliances)
or to hold the tongue in a more anterior
position (ie, tongue retaining devices).
Either design holds the soft tissues of
the oropharynx away from the posterior
pharyngeal wall, thereby maintaining
upper airway patency.
3.Pharmacological treatment
a.Drugs that are OSA-specificacetazol
amide ,donepezil,opiod antagonists,
theophylline, progestational agents,
nicotine, thyroxine, serotonergic
agents.
b. Drugs that target residual sleepiness­
m oda fin il, methylphen idate,
amphetamines.
4.Surgery
a.Surgical treatment most effective in
surgically correctable, obstructing
lesion. e.g. tonsillar hypertrophy that
is obstructing the pharyngeal airway.
b.Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP)-

< 4 > Respiratory System 
involves resection of the uvula, 
redundant retrolingual soft tissue, 
and palatine tonsillar tissue. 
c.Laser-assisted and radiofrequency
ablation (RFA).
d.Other common surgical procedures
for OSA include · septoplasty ,
rhinoplasty , nasal turbinate
reduction, nasal polypectomy,
palatal advancement pharyngoplasty,
tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, palatal
implants ( ie, Pillar procedure), tongue
reduction (partial glossecto my,
lingual tonsillectomy), genioglossus
advancement and maxillomandibular
advancement.
16 > Hepatopulmonary 
Syndrome 
Hepatopulmonary syndrome is considered present 
when the following triad exists: 
Liver disease 
•Impaired oxygenation-Orthodeoxia
•I ntrapulmonary vascular abnormalities, referred
to as intrapulmonary vascular dilatations
(IPVDs)
The unique pathological feature 5>fhepatopulmonary 
syndrome is gross dilatation of the pulmonary precapil­
lary and capillary vessels, as well as an absolute increase 
in the number of dilated vessels. A few pleural and 
pulmonary arteriovenous shunts and portopulmonary 
anastomoses may also be seen. 
Causes 
Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a complication 
of liver disease. 
1.It is most commonly associated with portal
hypertension (with or without cirrhosis),
although chronic liver disease of virtually any
etiology can be associated with HPS.
2.Also some acute liver diseases are associated eg.
ischemic hepatitis.
No specific type ofliver dis ease, severity ofliver disease, 
or laboratory abnormality predicts HPS. Clinical Manifestations 
Clinical features are the consequences of both hepatic 
and pulmonary dysfunction· 
Hepatic findings -Most patients with HPS have 
symptoms and signs of chronic liver disease. 
Many will have hemodynamic complications of liver 
dysfunction: 
1.Spider nevi -Spider nevi are cutaneous lesions
that may be a marker of intrapulmonary vascular
dilatations directly connecting pulmonary
arteries to veins (IPVDs).
2.Hyperdynamic circulation -A hyperdynamic
circulation manifests as three major findings:
elevated cardiac output at rest (often exceeding
7 L/min), decreased systemic and pulmonary
vascular resistance, and a narrowed arterial­
mixed venous oxygen content difference.
Pulmonary findings 
l.Dyspnea may be accompanied by pulmonary
findings that are more specific for HPS:
a.Platypnea -Platypnea is an increase
in dyspnea that is induced by moving
into an upright position and relieved by 
recumbency.
b.Orthodeoxia -Orthodeoxia refers to a
decrease in the arterial oxygen tension (by
more than 4 mmHg [0.5 kPal) or arterial
oxyhemoglobin desaturation (by more than
5 percent) when the patient moves from
a supine to an upright position, which is
improved by returning to the recumbent
position. The presence of orthodeoxia
in a patient with liver disease is strongly
suggestive(present in 88% patients) ofH PS,
although it can be seen in other situations
(eg, post-pneumonectom y, recurrent
pulmonary emboli, atrial septa! defects,
and chronic lung diseaset
It is hypothesized that platypnea and orthodeoxia 
in HPS are caused by preferential perfusion of 
IPVDs in the lung bases when the patient is 
upright. 
l.. Hypoxemia -Severe hypoxemia (PaO? 
<60 mmHg) in the absence of coexisting 
185 

cardiopulmonary disease is strongly suggestive 
of HPS.HPS -related hypoxemia is due to 
intrapulmonary vascular dilatations (IPVDs), 
which range ind iameter from 15 to 160 microns. 
Shunting through the IPVDs leads to ventilation· 
perfusion mismatch and oxygen diffusion 
limitation. 
Diagnosis 
General approach -The diagnosis ofhepatopulmo ­
nary syndrome (HPS) can be made when all of the 
following abnormalities have been confirmed: 
Liver disease 
•Impaired oxygenation-orthodeoxia.
•Intrapulmo naryvascularabnormali ties,referred
to as IPVDs
Impaired oxygenation 
Detection of impaired oxygenation requires that 
arterial blood gases be drawn with the patient sitting 
upright at rest-
!. Elevated alveolar-arterial { A-a) oxygen 
gradient(most sensitive) defined as;::: 
15 mmHg 
when breathing room air 
2.An arterial oxygen tension (PaO) of<80 mm Hg
also indicates impaired oxygenation.
3.The right-to-left shunt fraction-measures degree
to which oxygenation is impaired-calculate the
shunt fraction using the following formula �
Qs/Qt:::: ([PA02 -Pa02] x 0.003) + !([PA02 -Pa02] 
x 0.003) + SJ 
where Qs and Qt refer to shunt and 
total blood flow, 
respectively, and PA02 and Pa02 refer to the alveolar 
and arterial partial pressure of oxygen, respective ly. 
A limitation of this formula is that it assumes that 
the cardiac output is normal, rather than increased. 
Intrapulmonary vascular dilatations 
Used to detect IPVDs 
I. 
186 Echocardio graphy -Contrast-enhanced 
echocardiograph y is performed by injecting 
a contrast material intravenously and then 
performing echocardiogr aphy. The contrast 
material is usually agitated saline (forms a 
stream of microbubbles 60 to 150 microns in 2. 
3. PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
diameter) or iodocyanine green dye. With an 
intracardiac shunt, contrast generally appears 
in the left heart within three heart beats after 
injection. In contrast, with an intrapulmonary 
shunt, contrast generally appears in the left heart 
three to six heart beats after its appearance in 
the right heart. In patients with liver disease, 
detection of an intrapulmonary right to left 
shunt is considered indicative of IPVDs. 
Nuclear scanning -Technetium-labele d 
macroaggr egated albumin scanning. It 
involves intravenously injecting albumin 
macroaggregates that should be trapped in the 
pulmonary capillary bed, since the 20 micron 
diameter of the macroaggregates exceeds the 
normal pulmonary capillary diameter of 8 to 
15 microns. Scans that identify uptake of the 
radionuclide by the kidneys and/or brain suggest 
that the macroaggregates passed through either 
an intrapulmonary or intracardiac shunt .The 
proportion of radionuclide taken up by the 
kidneys and brain may be used to quantify the 
shunt. 
Pulmonary angiography -Is invasive and 
is generally reserved for excluding alternative 
causes of hypoxemia, such as pulmonary 
embolism, pulmonary hypertension,and/or large 
direct arteriovenous communic ations. 
Other diagnostic tests 
1.Chest radiography- increased bibasilarinterstitial
markings, 
probably a manifestation ofIPVDs.
2.HRCT chest -dilated perip
heral pulmonary
vessels and increased pulmonary artery to
bronchus ratio.
3.Pulmonary function test abnormalities -normal
expiratory flow rate and normal lung volume
measu cements; the diffusing capacity for carbon
monoxide ( 
D LCO) is typically mildly to severe! y
impaired
Disease Severity 
L Mild -An alveolar to arterial (A-a) oxygen 
gradient �15 mmHg and an arterial oxygen 
tension (PaO :) �80 m mHg while breathing room 
air 

( 4 > Respiratory System
2.Moderate -An A-a gradient;?: 15 mmHg and a
Pa02 in between e::60 mmHg and <80 mmHg
while breathing room air
3.Severe AnA-agradient;?:15mmHg andaPa02 
in between e::.50 mmHg and <60 mmHg while

alternatively, a PaO 2 <300 mmHg while breathing
100 percent oxygen.
Treatment 
There are no effective medical therapies for hepatopul­
monary syndrome (HPS), although many approaches 
have been attempted to improve gas exchange and 
decrease hypoxemia. Liver transplantation offers the 
most promise for the successful treatment of patients 
with HPS. 
1.Medical therapies
a.Long-term supplemental oxygen is the most
frequently recommended therapy.
b.Various other medications- e.g. methylene
blue, allium sativum (ie, garlic),
terlipressin, somatostatin analogues
(eg, octreotide), nitric oxide synthase
inhibitors, cyclooxygenase inhibitors (eg,
indomethacin), antibiotics, chemotherapy
(eg, cyclophosphamide), glucocorticoids,
beta blockers ( eg, propranolol ), and inhaled
nitric oxide have been tried.
2.Transjugular intrahepaticportosystemic shunt
(TIPS) placement -has been associated with
improvement of HPS.
3.Other medical interventions -plasma exchange
and the occlusion of intrapulmonary vascular
dilatations (I PVDs) via spring coil embolization.
4.Agents tested in animal models and appear
promising -pentoxifylline (inhibits nitric
oxide synthesis) and quercetin (a flavonoid
antioxidant ).
5.Liver transplantation -Liver transplantation
is indicated for patients with incapacitating
hypoxemia due to HPS.17 Allergic 
Bronchopulmonary 
Asperigillosis (ABPA) 
ABPA results from allergic pulmonary reaction to 
inhaled spores of Aspergillos fumigatus; can also occur 
occassionally with other Aspergillosis species. [(Rare) 
Penicillium, Candida, Mycosis, Helminthosporium ]. 
It is grouped under the syndrome of Pulmonary In­
filtrates with Eosinophil ia. 
Major diagnostic criteria 
1.Bronchial Asthma -Atopic
2.Peripheral Eosinophila (> 1000/µl)
3.Pulmonary Infiltration -+ Transient, Recurrent,
mostly involving upperlobes.
4.Central Bronchiectasis
5.Elevated serum IgE
6.Immediate wheel and Flare reaction to
Aspergillous fermigates.
7.Serum preciptions to Aspergillus fumigation •
classically low or undetectable.
Other diagnostic features 
l.History of Brownish plugs in sputum •
Eosinophils rich
2.Culture of A. fumigatus from sputum.
3.Elevated IgE (and IgG) class Antibodies specific
for A. fumigatus.
4.Hemoptysis
Treatment 
1.Bronchial Asthma : Treatment with Inhaled
Corticosteroids and Oral steroid if there are
signs of worsening or pulmonry shadowing is
found.
2.Oral Itraconazole is helpful in preventing
exacerbation.

midline sternotomy scar of coronary artery
bypass, open mitral commissurotomy or valve
replacement). Sinuses were commonly seen in
the past due to tuberculosis of spine.
B : Palpation 
J.Apex Beat
Apex beat is the lower most and outer most point
where maximum cardiac impulse is felt. It gives
a gentle thrust to the palpating finger.
Normally, it is located in the fifth left intercostal
space within the mid-clavicular line. It is
normally confined to one intercostal space or
less than 2.5 cm in diameter. It lasts for less than
50% of systole.
Abnormalities of Apex Beat
1.Tapping Apex : is the palpable first heart
sound felt in mitral stenosis due to loud
S1 and right ventricular enlargement. It is
a short and sharp systolic tap.
2.Hyperdynamic Apex : Is exaggerated in
amplitude and lasts for less than 2/3rd ofsystole. It is seen in LV volume overload or 
diastolic overload eg. 
(a)aortic regurgitation; (b) mitral
regurgitation; (c) high output states; (d)
patent ductus arterosis, VSD; (e) A.V.
fistulas; (f) Thin chest wall.
3.Heaving Apex: Is exaggerated in aplitude
and lasts for more than 2/3rd of systole. It
is well sustained. It is seen in LV pressure
overload or systolic overload e.g. (a) aortic
stenosis, (b) HOCM, (c) Coarctation of
Aorta, (d) Systemic hypertension.
4. Double Apical Impulse : Felt in (a) LV
Aneurysm; (b) Hypertrophic obstructive
cardiomyopathy; (c) LBBB
5.Diffuse Apex : is > 3 cm in diameter
or occupies more than one intercostal
space. (a) LV Aneurysm; (b) Severe LV
Dysfunction; (c) LV Dilatation, e.g. Aortic
Regurgitation.
6.Triple or Quadruple Impulse felt in HOCM.
7.Retractile Impulse: is systolic retraction or
indrawing of the apical impulse. It is called
Broadbents Sign. It is seen in Constrictive
Pericarditis.
8.Absent Apex Beat on the Left Side:
Non cardiac causes (a) obesity, thick chest
wall; (b) Emphysema; (c) Left pleural
effusion with shift of heart to the right.
Cardiac causes : (a) Dextrocardiac;
(b)Pericardia! Effusion; (c) Dilated
cardiomyopathy; (d) LV Dysfunction e.g.
: Coronary Artery Disease.
191 

ll.Parasternal Heave
Systolic impulse in the left parasternal region
commonly felt in right ventricular enlargement
is parasternal heave. It is assessed byplacing the
ulnar border of the hand on the left parasternal
area, with the patient in supine position.
AIIMS Grading of Parasternal Heave 
Grade I: Just touches hand 
Grade II: Palpable but compressible 
Grade Ill: Palpable but not compressible 
Sometimes an enlarged left atrium or an 
aneurysm of aorta may push the right ventricle 
up causing parasternal heave without right 
ventricular enlargement. 
Ill. Diastolic Shock 
This is the palpable second heart sound. Either 
the pulmonary or the aortic component may 
be palpable. A loud P2 suggests pulmonar y 
hypertens ion, whereas a loud A1 suggests 
systemic hypertension or aortitis. 
IV.Thrills
192 Thrills are palpable vibrations (like the purring
of a cat that is felt by the hand) associated with
heart murmurs. They are best felt with the palm
of the hand. It is intensified if the chest wall is
thin, site of production is near the surface of the
chest wall and the blood flow is rapid.
Presence of a thrill is a definite evidence of the
presence of an organic disease of the heart. They
may be systolic (AS, PS, MR, TR, ASD, VSD,
PDA), diastolic (MS, TS, AR) or continuous
( PDA, rupture of sinus ofValsalva aneurysm, AVPRACTICAL MEDICINE 
communication). The site and timing of thrill is 
given in the table below:

C: Percussion 
Percussion is mainly done to determine the boundaries 
of the heart. Percussion of the cardiac dullness has its 
limitations because fallacious results may be obtained 
due to greater part of the heart being surrounded by 
the resonant lung. The roots of the great vessels at the 
base of the heart produce a dull note that cannot be 
distinguished from cardiac dullness. 
However, percussion is useful to detect pericardia! 
effusion, aortic aneurysm, etc. rather than the size of 
the heart. Normally the right, left and upper borders 
are percussed. The lower border of the heart cannot 
be percussed because it cannot be distinguished from 
liver dullness. 
I.Left Border: The patient must be percussed in the
fourth and fifth space in the mid-axillary region
and then medially towards the left border of the
heart. The resonant note of the lung becomes
dull. Normally the left border is along the apex
beat. If it is outside the apex beat, it suggests
pericardia! effusion.
11.Upper border: The patient must be percussed

( 5 ) Cardiovascular System
in the second and third left intercostal spaces in 
the parasternal line, which is the line between 
the mid-clavicular and the lateral 
sternal line. 
Normally there is resonant note in the second 
space and dull note in the third space. If there 
is a dull note in the second space it suggests: 
1.Pericardia! effusion
2.Aneurysm of aorta
3.Pulmonary hypertension
4.Left atrial enlargement
5.Mediastinal mass
III.Right border: lhe patient must be percussed
anteriorly in the mid-clavicular line on the right
side until the liver dullness is percussed. Then
the percussion is done one space higher from
the mid-clavicular line medially to the sternal
border. Normally the right border of the heart
is 
retrosternal. If the dullness is parasternal it
suggests:
l.Pericardia! effusion
2.Aneurysm of ascending aorta
3.Right atrial enlargement
4.Dextrocardia
5.Mediastinal mass
6.Right lung base pathology
To Determine Situs 
Percussion ofliver dullness on the right and Stomach 
tympany on the left is present in situs solitus. Liver 
dullness on the left and stomach tympany on the right 
indicates situs inversus. 
D: Auscultation 
The stethoscope consists of a dual chest piece, with a 
bell and a 
diaphragm. The Bell is used to auscultate 
Low Frequency sounds {80-150 Hz) such as S3, S4 and 
mid diastolic murmur of MS. 
The Diaphgram is used to auscultate High Frequency 
Sounds (>300 Hz) such as S1, S2, OS, Clicks, Systolic 
murmur and early diastolic murmurs. 
The tubing is usually 12 inches long. 
Auscultation is done to describe 
I.Heart Sounds
IL MurmursIll. Other Sounds (opening snap, clicks, pericardia!

I.Heart Sounds
Normally there are four heart sounds recorded pho­
nocardiographically but clinically in majority of the 
cases only two heart sounds are usually audible. The 
heart sounds are auscultated in all the four areas of 
the chest, namely the mitral, tricuspid, pulmonary 
and aortic areas (see Table). The first heart sound is 
best appreciated in the mitral area whilst the 
second 
heart sound is best appreciated in the aortic and 
pulmonary areas. 
Normally the first heart sound is single because the 
tricuspid and mitral components occur simultaneously. 
The second heart sound is normally split, because the

aortic valve doses earlier than the pulmonary valve. 
This split of the second heart sound is best appreciated 
in the pulmonary area. 
First Heart Sound (S1) 
It is produced by the closure of the mitral and tricuspid 
valves (M1 & T1 respectively). Normally the mitral 
valve closes before the tricuspid valve by 20-30 msec. 
Hence S1 is appreciated as a single sound. 
It is a high frequency sound heard best with the dia­
phragm of the stethoscope. 
It is timed with simultaneous palpation of the carotid 
pulse. S1 indicates the onset of systole

In RBBB or VPC originating from LV, the LV
systole starts first resulting in MV closing earlier.
This is followed by RV systole which results in a
late TV closure, thus causing a split S1 (M,-T).

It is normally has two components, produced by clo­
sure of the aortic valve (A) and pulmonary valve ( P / 
Normally, it is a high frequency sound, heard better 
in the aortic and pulmonary area. 
It is normally split because the aortic valve closes before 
the pulmonary valve. The A1 is normally louder than 
P 2• During inspiration, the splitting of A2 P 2 becomes 
wider. During expiration the splitting of A2P 2 is nar­
rower and S1 may be heard as a single sound.

5.Severe MR
Mechanism 
1.Widely Split S 1 : Abnormal wide splitting of S2 
is defined as an audible expiratory split of A2 P 2•
It may occur due to delayed P 2 or early A2• It is
occasionally normal in children.
2.Wide and Fixed Split S,: It is the hallmark of
ASD (Ostium secund�m type). The split of
A2 P1 is wide due to delayed P2, resulting from
increased venous return, RV Stroke volume and
RV ejection time during inspiration. Therefore,
there is no left to right shunt across ASD during
inspiration.
196 During expiration, there is a reduced venous
return to Right atrium but the left to right
shunt across the ASD leads to increased RV
filling, RV stroke volume and RV ejection time.
This minimises respiratory variation of the RV
volumes and leads to a wide and fixed split S2•
Another mechanism of wide and fixed split S2 
is related to pulmonary hangout interval. In
ASD, there is increased pulmonary blood flow
due to increased volume of blood in RV due
to left to right shunt. This leads to increased
capacitance of pulmonary vascular bed, during
both phases ofrespiration (normally, an increase
in capacitance of pulmonary vascular bed occurs
during inspiration).
The pulmonary valve is expected to close when
the pressure in the RV falls below the pressure
in the pulmonary artery. However, in reality the
pulmonary valve closes later ( the PV closes at
the level of the incisura of the pulmonary artery
tracing). The hangout interval is measured from
the incisura on the pulmonary artery tracing
(PV closes) to the same level of the RV pressure
tracing (Figure 5.9).
This hangout interval is determined by
pulmonary capacitance and RV ejection time.PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
It is normally 60-80 msec. In ASD, the hangout 
interval is prolonged and fixed due to increased 
pulmonary capacitance during both phases of 
respiration. This leads to a wide and fixed split 
second heart sound.

Third 
Heart Sound (S3)
Normally only two heart sounds are audible. The third 
heart sound is heard in the 
following conditions: 
l.Normal up to 30 years and in children, atheletes
and pregnancy
2.MR
3.TR
4.CCF
5.Myocardial infarction
6.ASD, VSD, PDA
7.High 
output state
8.Dilated cardiomyopathy
Mechanism: 
Normally the third heart sound is a low frequency 
sound, heard because of the first rapid filling phase 
of the ventricular diastole when blood flows from the 
atria into the ventricles. 
• In MR and TR during systole some blood goes 
back into the atria and hence there is increased 
flow into the ventricles during the first rapid 
filling phase 
resulting in the third heart sound. 
In heart failure there is increased atrial pressure 
and hence increased first rapid filling results in 
the third heart sound. 
197 

It is important to note that in significant mitral stenosis 
the third heart sound is never heard because rapid 
filling of the ventricles is not possible because of a 
stenosed A-V valve. 
Factors that prevent detection of third heart sound 
are environmental noise, emphysema, obesity, failure 
to apply the bell properly and examining the patient in 
sitting position. It disappears on standing up. A latent 
third heart sound can be made audible by rolling the 
patient onto the bed from sitting position to lying 
position or by passive straight leg raising. 
If the heart rate is over 100 beats/min, discrimination 
of third or fourth heart sound is not possible and the 
triple rhythm (gallop) is called summation gallop. 
Right ventricular third heart sound is located at the 
left lower sternal border rather than the apex and often 
increases on inspiration. It may radiate to right supra­
clavicular fossa. It is commonly seen in cor pulmonale.

II.Murmurs
Murmurs are abnormal heart sounds caused by vi­
bration of the valves or the wall of the heart or great 
vessels. Murmurs may be systolic (ifit is between first 
and second heart sound) or diastolic (if between the 
second and first heart ·sound) or continuous. 
Levine 
grades systolic murmurs as follows: 
Table 5.4 : Grading of Systolic Murmurs 
Grade I : Very faint murmur only audible with effort 
Grade II : Faint murmur but clearly and definitely audible 
Grade Ill : Moderately loud murmur but no thrill 
Grade IV : Loud murmur with thrill 
Grade V : Louder with thrill and can be heard with stetho­
scope halflifted off chest wall 
Grade VI : Murmur with thrill heard even if stethoscope is 
just lifted up from the chest wal I. 
Diastolic murmurs have only Grades I to IV. 
Factors for production of murmurs. 
1.Flow of blood through an abnormal orifice. e.g.
in mitral stenosis or regurgitation.
2.High velocity flow through a normal orifice. e.g.
in anemia, hyperkinetic states.
Innocent Murmurs 
Soft systolic murmurs heard in patients without any 
cardiac abnormality are called Innocent murmurs. 
Characteristics 
1.More commonly heard in children (Still's
murmur)
2.Usually heard in the 
pulmonary area

accentuated during systole. Firm digital pressure 
applied laterally obliterates it. 
A. Ill. Other Sounds 
Opening Snap 
This is heard midway between the second 
and third heart sounds in cases of m itral or 
tricuspid stenosis. It is a high pitched, loud 
snapping or clicking, sharp sound due to 
sudden tensing of the cusps of the mitral 
( or tricuspid) valve as it tries to open during 
early diastole. It is best heard just inside the 
apex beat. It is not related to respiration or 
posture, but is accentuated with exercise 
and is best heard with the diaphragm of 
the stethoscope. 

( 5 > Cardiovascular System 
The interval between the onset of the 
second heart sound and the opening snap 
(A2-0S interval) is a good guide to judge 
the severity of mitral stenosis. The shorter 
the A2 -OS interval, the more severe the 
mitral stenosis.

IV.Dynamic Auscultation
202 Physiologic or pharmacolog ical maneuvers
carried out to change the circulatory
hemodynamics and hence the quality of heart
sounds and murmurs:PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
l.Respiration: Inspiration leads to increased
venous return and therefore increased flow
to right side of the heart.
On the other hand, inspiration leads to
increased pooling of blood in pulmonary
vascular bed and therefore reduces the
pulmonary venous return and reduces the
flow of blood to the left side of the heart.
The opposite occurs during expiration.
Thus, Right Sided Murmurs are louder
during inspiration. [TR murmur is
accentuated in inspiration - Carvallo sign].
Conversely, Left Sided Murmurs are louder
during expiration.
Exception : (l) Mitra! Valve Prolapse
(MVP) · Inspiration reduces pulmonary
venous return and flow of blood into left
side of heart. This reduces the LV size. This
increases redundency of Mitral Leaflets
and increases the prolapse. Therefore the
murmur of MVP is louder and longer
and the click is earlier in Inspiration.
(2)H.O.C.M. During inspiration, the
reduced LV size leads to increased sub­
aortic obstruction. Therefore, the murmur
is louder during inspiration.
2.Valsalva maneuver: In this manouver, the
patient is asked to close his nose with her
fingers and breathe forcibly through the
closed mouth. This causes forced expiration
against a closed glottis.

It has 4 phases summarized in Table. 
Dynamic auscultation is described during 
changes in phase II (maintainance phase) 
of valsalva manouver. During this phase, 
there is increase in intra-thoracic presure 
and reduced venous return. This reduces 
flow on the right and left side of the heart. 
Therefore all murmurs are softer. 
Exception : Since venous return is reduced, 
LV size is also reduced. Therefore the 
murmur of HOCM becomes louder and 
the murmur and click in MVP become 
louder and earlier 
3.Isometric Hand Grip or Exercise: Left sided

Definition:Acute rheumatic fever {RF) is an inflam 
matory complication that may follow group A beta 
hemolytic streptococcal infection, manifested by one 
or more of the following: arthritis, carditis, chorea, 
erythema marginatum and subcutaneous nodules. 
Pathogenesis:Following exudative streptococcal phar­
yngitis, rheumatic fever occurs after about 2 weeks. The 
exact pathogenetic pathway by which streptococcus 
leads to rheumatic inflammation is not known. Various 
mechanisms proposed are: 
l.Direct toxic action by streptococcus, or its "L
form" lacking the cell wall
2. 
3. Allergic reaction to the organism or its product
Autoimmune reaction: There is similarity between
the carbohydrate of the streptococcus and some
proteins of heart valves causing the immune
reaction. This is the most accepted theory.
Pathology:Rheumatic fever can involve any or all the 
layers of the heart (pancarditis). Involvement of the 
valvular endocardium may lead to tiny vegetation on 
the valves and destruction and fibrosis of valve sub­
stance with fusion of cusps of commissures leading to 
stenosis. There is myocarditis and fibrinous pericarditis 
(bread-and -butter appearance). Both are self-limiting 
causing no permanent sequelae. 
Microbiology:The hallmark of carditis is the 
"Aschoff" body which is a granulomatous lesion of 
the endocardium with fibrinoid necrosis. This area is 
203 

surrounded by cardiac histiocytes called Aschoff cells 
or Anitschoff cells. Mccullaris patch in chronic RF.

4 Infective Endocarditis 
It is a microbial infection of the heart valves or the 
endothelium in proximity to congenital or acquired 
cardiac defects. 
Organisms 
The common organisms are Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus aureus, Pneumococcus, group A Strep­
tococcus, Gonococcus, Brucella and Rickettsia. They 
commonly follow tonsillectomy, dental extraction or 
suppurative cellulitis. 
In narcotic addicts the endocarditis may affect the 
right side of the heart and the common organisms are 
Proteus, Pseudomonas and Klebsiella. 
Following open-heart surgery fungal endocarditis is 
common with Histoplasma, Candida or Aspergillus. 
Listeria endocarditis is common in patients on im· 
munosuppressive therapy. 
Pathogenesis 
The characteristic lesions in endocarditis are veg­
etations over the valve leaflet. Sterile thrombotic 
vegetations form due to trauma to the endocardial 
cells. Thrombi may form over a sub-endocardial in­
flammatory reaction such as in acute rheumatic fever 
or myocardial infarction. When bacteremia occurs, 
the surface of the vegetation can become secondarily 
infected and converted to the typical vegetations of 
infective endocarditis. This results from deposition of 
platelets and fibrin over the bacteria. The vegetations 
then become a protective site through which phagocyte 
cells penetrate poorly. 
Endocardit is occurs at a site where blood flows through 
a narrow orifice and at a high velocity, from a high 
to a low-pressure chamber. Lateral pressure is lowest 
and the velocity of blood greatest a short distance 
downstream from the opening between the chambers. 
A decrease in lateral pressure lowers perfusion of the 
intima, resulting in an area more susceptible to infec 
tion. This is the location where infective endocarditis 
initially develops. Hence it occurs on the right side in 
VSD and on the pulmonary artery in PDA. Endocar­
ditis does not usually occur when there is only a small 
pressure gradient as in ASD or when the congenital 
defect is large enough to abolish the pressure gradient. 
A high velocity stream of blood can produce satellite 
infected lesions at distant points of impact. Hence, 
endocarditis occurs more frequently with incompetent 
than pure stenotic lesions and is characteristically seen 
on the atrial side in mitral valve and on the ventricular 
side in aortic valve lesions. 
l.Vegetations may become extensive (as in fungal
endocarditis) and completely occlude the valve
orifice.
205 

2.The valve tissues may be rapidly destroyed
resulting in incompetence of the valve e.g.
Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis.
3.Areas of healing may cause scar formation and
consequent stenosis or 
insufficiency of the valve.
4.The infection may spread leading to conduction
abnormalities, rupture of chorda tendineae,
papillary muscles or the ventricular septum.
This carries grave prognosis.
Clinical Manifestations 
I. 
II. 
206 Signs of Infection 
l.Fever with chills and rigors coming down
with sweating. If there is associated cardiac
failure, fever may be absent for as long as
4 months.
2.Progressive normochromicand normocytic
anemia.
N.B Microcytic, hypochromic anemia by
itself can cause low-grade fever, petechiae,
systolic murmur and splenomegaly.
3.Tachycardia
4.Clubbing: It takes 3-6 weeks to develop. It 
disappears once the patient is cured
5.Splenomegaly: Spleen enlargement is not
gross. If 
spleen suddenly enlarges, is tender
and a rub is present 
over the spleen, it
suggests 
splenic infarction.
6.Febrile proteinuria
7.Leucocytosis
8.Blood culture: Usually organisms are grown
on blood culture
Cardiac Signs 
1.Signs of a pre-existing cardiac lesion is
usually present except in patients with
congestive cardiac failure, atrial fibrillation,
renal failure or severe debility
2.Changing intensity of the cardiac murmur.
3.Appearance of new murmurs
4.ECG: Prolonged PR interval. AV block may
be present if the septum is involved.
There may be no cardiac signs especially if
the right side of the heart is involved.III. PRACTICAL MEDICINE

6. Petechiae: This occurs due to embolic 
episodes, anemia or 
toxic damage to the 
vessel. It is found in the conjunctiva, palate, 
buccal mucosa and extremities. It is called 
splinter hemorrhage ifit occurs under the 
nail. 
Osler nodes: They occur singly or in crops, 
due to vasculitis. They are transient, tender, 
red nodules, the size of pinhead to pea, on 
the finger pads, the sides of the fingers and 
toes and thenar and hypothenar eminences. 
They disappear in few days. They may 
also be seen in SLE, typhoid, gonococcal 
infection. 
Janeway's lesions: They are subepithelial 
microabcesses and are large non-tender 
macules over palms and soles. These are 
commonly seen in acute endocarditis. 
Peripheral vascular embolization: This may 
involve larger vessels like carotids or radials, 
resulting in hemiplegia and painful fingers. 
If an embolus sits at the bifurcation of an 
aorta it will cause Leriche's syndrome that is 
characterized by acute onset of paraplegia, 
impotence and absent pulsations oflower 
Jim bs that become cold, cyanosed and later 
gangrenous. 
Pulmonary embolism: This resembles 
hemorrhagic bronchopn eumonia. 
Pulmonary embolism occurs if the 
vegetations are on the tricuspid or 
pulmonary valves or if there is a left to 
right shunt. 
Optic fundi: 
a.Roth's spots: These are flame-shaped
or canoe-shaped hemorrhages with
central pallor. They are seen in severe
anemia, leukemias and collagen
vascular diseases in addition to
infective endocarditis.
b.Embolization of the retinal artery:
This leads to blindness.
c.Papilledema due to embolic cerebral
infarction or renal involvement.

( 5 ) Cardiovascular System 
investigations 
1.Hemogram: Normochromic, normocyti c
anemia, leucocytosis and raised ESR.
2.ECG: Tachycardia, prolonged PR interval,
atrioventricular block if septum is involved and
signs of acute myocardial infarction if there is
coronary embolism.
3.Blood culture: This usually grows the causative
agent. It is negative in cases of endocarditis
caused by Aspergillus, Histoplasma, Coxiella
burnetii, anaerobic organisms and non-bacterial
thrombotic endocarditis. It may also be negative
if the patient is already on antibiotics or if there
is faulty technique.
4.Serum proteins: Immunoglobulins are
increased. IgM is selectively raised with
rickettsial infection.
5.Echocardiogram: This 
may suggest the location
of the vegetations.
Differential Diagnosis 
The possibility of infective endocarditis should be 
suspected in any patient with a cardiac murmur and 
unexplained fever present for at least one week. Some 
clinical conditions, which have similar manifestations, 
i.e. fever, murmur and embolic episodes, are:
1.Acute rheumatic fever
2.Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis
3.Atrial myxoma
4.Systemic lupus erythematosus
5.Sickle cell disease
Hence a deli.nit ive diagnosis can only be made on posi -
ti ve blood culture though a negative blood culture does 
not rule out the possibility of infective endocarditis. 
Two-dimensional echocardiogram is also very useful. 
Treatment 
The cellular and humoral host defense mechanisms 
that normally eliminate organisms from other sites are 
not very effective in endocarditis. Hence, inhibition of 
the growth of the microorganism is not adequate for 
cure. In fact, the bactericidal drug regimens are neces­
sary and the treatment must be continued for a long 
enough period of time to achieve sterilization of the vegetations. In addition, sufficient concentrations of 
antimicrobial agents must be reached in the serum to 
guarantee penetration of antibacterial concentrations 
into the vegetations. 
I.Antibacterial Drugs
A.Streptococci: Penicillin and Streptomycin
exert a more rapid action than does
penicillin alone. Penicillin G 4 million
units 6 hourly IV with Gentamicin IV
lmg/kg (max 80 mg) 8 hourly. If the
patient is hypersensitive to penicillin then
Ceftriazone IV 2 gm is given once daily. If
allergic to penicillin and cephalosporin,
give Vancomycin IV 30 mg/kg/day 12
hourly (max 2g/day).
B.Staphylococci: For Staphylococcus aureus
only Penicillinase resistant penicillins
(i.e. cloxacillin-nafcillin, methicillin and
oxacillin) or Cefazolin (2 gm of either IV
every 4 hourly) may be used, and continued
for 6 weeks. For organisms resistantto these
antibiotics, Vancomycin 30 mg/kg/day 12
hourly IV for 6 weeks may be given.
C.Enterococci: For enterococcal endocarditis,
Penicillin G IV 4 million units 6 hourly
with Gentamicin 1-1.5 mg/kg. 8 hourly.
No alternate drug has been tested for
efficacy in enterococcal endocarditis; hence
if the patient is sensitive to penicillin, a
desensitizing procedure should be tried.
This involves a scratch test through a
drop of penicillin G (100 units/ml).
This is followed in 30-45 min. by graded
amounts of penicillin intraderma lly,
beginning at 0.001 units per 0.1 ml. of
test solution and continued in tenfold
increment every 30-45 min. With increasing
amounts, administration is changed to the
subcutaneous, intramuscular and finally
the intravenous route. Epinephrine and
diphen-hydramine should be on hand
for emergency use during the procedure,
if an anaphylactic reaction occurs. It is
important to maintain continuous IV
administration of penicillin throughout
the course of treatment. If the IV infusion
207 

is stopped it may be necessary to repeat the 
entire "desensitization". 
If the patient still develops severe 
reaction, Vancomycin may be used as for 
streptococcal endocarditis. 
D.Other organisms
1.E. coli and Proteus mirabilis: Penicillin,
Ampicillin or cephalosporin
2. Salmonella: Ciprofloxacin or
Chloramphenicol 
3. Klebsiella: Cefotaxime
4.Enterobacter, Pseudomonas and
Proteus other than P mirabilis:
Piperacillin, Ceftazidine, Amikacin
or Ciprofloxacin.
5.Fungal: Amphotericin B 1 mg/kg/day
IV and Flucytosine PO 150 mg/kg/
day in 4 divided doses.
E.Emperic Therapy till culture report
available:
Ampicillin IV 2 g 4 hourly + Nafcillin IV
2 g 4 hourly+ Gentamicin IV lmg/kg 8
hourly or Vancomycin IV I mg/kg/day 12
hourly (for penicillin-allergic patients) +
Gentamicin I mg/kg 8 hourly.
Response to Therapy 
I.The blood culture becomes negative within
several days after the onset of therapy.
2.Regression offever, weight gain and a fall in ESR
occur soon, but may take several weeks.
3.Hematuria and proteinuria disappear along with
the therapy.
4.Regression of dubbing takes several weeks.
5.Splenomegaly may persist for many months.
6.Although anemia may respond in several weeks,
the rise in hemoglobin may be very slow.
Prognosis 
With the antimicrobial therapy the prognosis for 
infective endocarditis is good. The factors that tend 
to make the prognosis poor are: 
I.Non-streptococcal disease

Amoxycillin PO 1.5 g 8 hours later.
4.Cardiac surgery: Prophylaxis is directed against
staphylococci and consists of 2 gm Methicillin,
Oxacillin, Nafcillin or Cephalothin IV every 4
hourly starting I hour before the procedure and
continuing for several days.
5 > lschemic Heart Disease 
Definition: Ischemic heart disease (IHD) occurs 
whenever there is an imbalance between myocardial 
oxygen demand and its supply. 

( 5 ) Cardiovascular System 
Causes: The commonest cause ofIHD isatherosclerotic 
coronary artery disease. Other causes are: 
J.Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease
JI. Other coronary artery diseases 
l.Coronary artery spasm
2.Coronary arteritis
3.Embolism
4.Coronary A-V malformation

Coronary Anatom y 
There are 2 coronary arteries -left (LCA) and right 
(RCA) that arises from the aorta at the sinus ofValsalva. 
The left main (LM) stem is short and divides into left 
anterior descending (LAD) -which supplies major 
part of the left ventricle (LV) and the anterior part of interventricular septum (IVS) -and the circumflex 
(CX)-which supplies the posterior and variable
amounts of the inferior LV, sinoatrial (40%) and
atrioventricular nodes and sometime s LV apex and
posterior wall. RCA supplies the RV, sinoatrial node
(60%) and posterior part of IVS.
The dominant circulation refers to the artery which 
gives rise to the "posterior descending artery" which 
supplies posterior part ofIVS. Hence it may be either 
right dominant or left dominant circulation. Right 
dominant is more common. 
Coronary Physiology 
During stress, the coronary blood can be increased 
5-6 times the basal values. This is regulated by coro­
nary autoregulation mechanism. In the resting state,
coronary blood flow is adequate until there is 75% or
more narrowing of epicardial artery.
During stress, the perfusion pressure does not increase, 
but the increased flow is maintained by coronary vaso­
dilatation, which is controlled by various metabolites 
like adenosine, prostaglandins, carbon dioxide and 
hydrogen ions. The coronary vascular resistance would 
fall to 20-25% of basal state in response to maximal 
demand on exercise. The ability to lower the resistance 
to flow at rest, even when there is an 80% reduction 
in the diameter of a large coronary artery, allows a 
patient to be asymptomatic in spite oflarge reductions 
in internal diameter of the artery.

region or pain in the areas of radiation without sub­

Sometimes there may be breathlessness or fatigue due 
to low cardiac output. 
Types 
I.Stable: It occurs with known physical effort and
is relieved with rest and nitrates. Cold weather,
smoking, emotional upset, high altitude, sexual
intercourse and straining at stools can also
aggravate it.
2.Nocturnal: Angina appears in the middle of the
night due to left ventricular failure which may
be precipitated by dreams causing release of
catecholamines a full urinary bladder or transient
hypoglycemia.
3. 
4. 
210 Unstable: This is also called Preinfarction angina
as 20% of these patient develop myocardial
infarction within 4 months.
The following types of angina! pains are called
unstable angina:
a.Recent angina (less than 60 days)
b.Stable angina in which symptoms are more
severe in intensity, frequency and duration
(Crescendo)
c.Angina at rest and lasting > IO minutes
d.Angina not relieved by rest or nitrates
Prinzmetal angina: This was described by the 
early hours of morning associated with ST 
elevation on ECG. It responds to nifedipine or 
nitrates as it is caused by coronary spasm that 
can be induced by smoking or hyperventilation. Spasm may be caused by increased alpha­
adrenergic activity during early hours of morning 
or due to platelet aggregation. Though coronary 
arteries can be normal on angiography, in 50% of 
patients there maybe associated coronary artery 
obstructive disease. Beta-blockers may aggravate 
the spasm and hence are contraindicated. 
5. Post infarction angina: Some patients with
myocardial infarction develop angina 2 days
to 8 weeks following the infarction. Most of
them have multivessel disease and residual
myocardial ischemic. They require early coronary
angiography and appropriate treatment.
Table 5.13 : Assessment of Chest Pain

Diagnosis 
I.Clinical: A typical history of angina itself could
give the diagnosis even in absence of any other
abnormality on examination or investigation.
Though physical examination in angina is often
normal, certain clues to the presence of IHD
may be present -Gallop rhythm (third heart
sound), left ventricular enlargement, thickened
blood vessels or absent pulses, systolic murmur

( 5 > Cardiovascular System 
of mitral regurgitation or papillary muscle 
dysfunction or basal rales may be present. 
Table 5.14 : Functional Classification of 
fatigue, Palpitation, Dyspnea or Anginal 
Pain{New York Heart Association (NYHA)]
In a patient with established cardiac disease: 
1. No/imitations to physical activity. Ordinary physical ac
tivity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dys 
pnea or anginal pain. 
II. Slight limitation of physical activity: Comfortable ai
rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, pal pi 
tation dyspnea, or angina I pain. 
Ill. Marked limitation of physical activity: Comfortable a1 
rest. Less than ordinary physical activity causes fa 
tigue, palpitation, dyspnea or angina I pain. 
IV.Symptoms at rest: Inability to carry on any physical ac
tivity without discomfort. Symptoms offatigue, pal pi 
tation, dyspnea or anginal pain may be present even
at rest. It any physical activity is undertaken, discom
fort is increased. 
II.Diagnostic Tests:
1.ECG: In 50% of patients with angina,
resting ECG may be normal at rest. During
angina! episode, ST depression (stable/
unstable angina) or elevation (Prinzmetal
type) may be present. These may disappear
with rest or following sublingual nitrates
or nifedipine.
2.Cardiac Enzymes (CK-MB, Trop T/Trop I):
In angina, cardiac enzymes are normal. In
a patient with typical chest pain and ECG
changes of ST depression, if enzymes are
normal, then it is UNSTABLE ANGINA.
If enzymes are raised, then it is a non-ST
segment elevation Ml (NSTEMI).
3.Stress testing: This is done with treadmill or
bicycle ergometer using standard protocols
like Bruce's. The workload is gradually
increased by increasing the speed and
elevation of the treadmill. The patient is 
exercised up to predicted target heart rate
(220 -Age in years) or till there is ECG
changes of ischemia, hypotension gallop,
pain, fatigue, dyspnea or hypotension.
This test though very popular can give both
false positive and false negative results.It is contraindicated in unstable angina, 
acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, 
arrhythmias, A-V blocks, severe aortic 
stenosis and debilitating conditions. 
4.Thallium Stress Test: This test is done by
injecting Thallium whilst the patient
exercises and then the regional myocardial
perfusion is assessed by using a gamma
camera. Thallium is picked up only by
normal myocardium; ischemic areas would
appear as perfusion defects. However, scans
taken 2-4 hours after exercise may show 
reperfusion of Thallium in the ischemic
zone signifying reversible ischemia. The
necrosed area continues to remain cold.
This has 85% specificity and sensitivity.
5.Holter Monitoring: Ambulatory ECG
monitor may detect episodes of ST segment
changes during normal activities. Some of
the episodes of ST segment changes during
normal activities. Some of the episodes of 
ST T changes may not be accompanied by
symptoms (Silent ischemia).
6.Echocardiography and Doppler study: This
is helpful to judge the regional wall motion
abnormality, left ventricular thrombus,
ejection fraction and mitral and mitral
regurgitation. Stress echocardiogram can
identify regional wall 
motion abnormality
immediately after exercise.
7.Coronary angiogram: This is a specific
test to diagnose blockage of coronary
arteries and its location and severity. It
is usually indicated in severe angina not
responding to medical treatment in whom
revascularization through angioplasty or
by pass surgery is planned.
Differential Diagnosis 
I.Non-coronary cardiac causes
1.Cardiomyopathy: There is usually a gallop
rhythm with systolic murmur of papillary
muscle dysfunction. However, chest
pain is more prolonged and not typically
constricting. Echocardiogram identifies
cardiomyopathy.
211 

2.Mitra/ valve prolapse: The chest pain is
rarely typical angina!, is usually prolonged,
associated with anxiety and is more
common in females. A mid-systolic click
with a murmur may be present.
II.Neuropsychiatric (anxiety state): The pain is 
usually stabbing or jabbing without any relation
to exertion. It also lasts longer and may be
associated with palpitations, perspiration and
cold limbs ECG is usually normal.
III.Musculoskeletal
1.Costochondritis (Tietze's syndrome): There
is local pain and tenderness with swelling
over costochondral junction, which may be
mistaken as angina. ECG usually normal.
2.Cervical Spondylitis: There is usually
radiating pain from the neck going to the
arms and sometimes chest. It is associated
with paresthesia ECG is normal and X-ray
spine may show cervical spondylitis.
3.Herpes Zoster: In the pre-eruptive phase,
herpes zoster of the left side of chest may
mimic angina. However, it is usually in
the distribution of the nerve root. Once
eruptions appear as typical herpetic
vesicles, the diagnosis is clear.
IV.Pulmonary
I.Pneumotho rax(Left-sided): Maycausechest
pain, which may suggest IHD. However,
there is shift of the mediastinum to the
right and decreased breath sounds.
2.Pneumonia: Left sided pneumonia can cause
chest pain, which can mimic angina. There
is usually no relation to exertion but the
pain is aggravated on inspiration. Fever and
constitutional symptoms may be present.
V.Gastrointestinal
212 I.Hiatus hernia: The chest pain is usually a
feeling of heartburn or indigestion, which
occurs after meals on postural changes
without any relation to effort. It can mimic
nocturnal of postprandial angina. Stress
test is usually normal and barium studies
of esophagus may demonstrate the lesion.
2.Achalasia Cardia: There is squeezing painPRACTICAL MEDICINE 
in the substernal area radiating to the jaw 
or arm and precipitated by food. There may 
as associated dysphagia for liquids more 
than solids. ECG is normal and barium 
studies would show the spasm. 
3.Cholecystitis and Gallstones: The pain
is usually in the epigastrium or right
hypochondrium with nausea and vomiting.
Gallstones can be seen on sonographic
examination of upper abdomen.
4.Peptic Ulcer: The pain has burning character
and has no relation to effort. It also lasts
longer.
5.Splenic flexure syndrome: Distension of
splenic flexure of colon can cause precordial
pain referred to the shoulder. The pain has
no relation to efforts and is often relieved
on passing flatus or stools.
Management 
I.Treatment of acute attack
I.Di-Nitrates: Glycerine trinitrate 0.5 mg.
or isosorbide dinitrate 5 mg sublingually
relieves the attack in 2 5 minutes
(Mononitrates are contraindicated). Rarely
relief may nor occur or may be followed
rapidly by a relapse. It may cause slight
heaviness in the head and hypotension. It
is also available as ointment to be applied
on the skin.
2.Beta-blockers or Calcium channel blockers:
May be used to decrease pain.
II.Prevention of anginal attacks
1.Modification of life style: Life style should
be changed to avoid precipitating factors.
Exertion, especially following meals,
walking uphill against the wind must be
avoided. Emotional disturbances like anger
and anxiety must be avoided if possible.
2.Rest and Exercise: Bed rest is usually not
required unless there are frequent attacks
or there is angina decubitus. Exercise that
does not cause pain or breathlessness may
be allowed.
3.Controlof risk factors: The risk factors must

{ 5 > Cardiovascular System

-:=:: c:) , � ,G-=chcst wall 
4. 
s. be controlled if present. Hypertension, 
diabetes and hyperlipidemia ( with statins) 
must be treated with drugs if required. 
Obese patient must be asked to reduce 
weight. Smoking must be strictly forbidden. 
Tranquilizers: Diazepam 5-10 mg6-8 hourly 
or Alprazolam 0.25 -0.5 mg 8 hourly may 
be given to relieve anxiety. 
Coronary Vasodilators: 
a.Nitrates: lsosorbide dinitrate 5 mg
6 
8 hourly may be given sublingually
for best 
effect. An extra dose may be
given 
prior to an anticipated attack.
2% nitroglycerine ointment may be
applied over 
the arm or chest 3-4 times
a day. Mononitrates like Isosorbide
mononitra _te (20 mg) are usually given

214 at 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. in an eccentric 
dosing fashion to avoid tolerance. 
b.Calcium antagonist drugs: Nifedipine
10 mg, Diltiazem 30 mg or Verapamil
80 mg 4 times a day may be given to
relieve angina.
6.Beta-blockers: Beta blockers reduce the
oxygen requirement of 
the heart by
reducing the heart rate, blood pressure
and cardiac contractib ility. Propranolol
or oxprenolol 40 mg 6-8 hourly may be
given. They are contraindicated in presence
of associated cardiac failure, bronchial
asthma or Prinzmetal angina. Atenolol or
Metoprolol in small doses (50 mg daily)
may be given in such situations, as they
are cardio selective.
7.Ace Inhibitors I Angiotensin Receptor
Blockers are useful in chronic IHD to
prevent remodeling of heart. They are
associated with decreased mortality (e.g.
Ramipril, Lasartan).
8.Antiplatelet drugs:
a.Low-dose Aspirin: It acetylates
cyclo-oxygenase and inhibits
thromboxane A synthesis which
causes platelet aggregation and is a
potent vasoconstrictor. It is given in
the dose if 75-150 mg per day.
b.Dipyridamole: It decreases platelet
aggregation in the dose of 200-300
mg per 
day and has been used in
angina. Combined with aspirin, the
dose required is half.
c.Ticlopidine: This inhibits the final stage
of platelet aggregation. It is not used
any more.
d.Clopidogrel: Blocks platelet ADP
receptor and decreases platelet
activation. Dose 75 mg OD.
e.Newer Antiplatelet agents: Prasugrel
JO mg OD, Ticagrelor 90 mg BD, IV
Cangrelov.

Ilb/ ma receptors on platelets and decrease 
platelet aggregation. They may be used 
instead of heparins in unstable angina, and 
for patients undergoing 
angioplasty with 
stenting procedure (Facilitated PTCA). 
10.Anticoagulation: In unstable angina,
unfractionated I.V. heparin 5000 units stat
followed by 1000 units/hour can be given.
Newer 
Low Molecular Weight (LMW)
Heparins may also be used (See Ch. 15).
Ill. Definitive Treatment of Angina 
Coronary Revascularization : 
A coronary 
angiography should be done to determine 
the coronary anatomy and to detect coronary 
artery disease. Revascularization is offered 
with percutaneous Transluminal Coronary 
Angioplasty (PTCA) or Coronary Artery Bypass 
Grafting (CABG) Surgery (Ref. to Pg. 217) 
Myocardial Infarction 
Myocardial infarction results from thrombotic occlu­
sion (or sometimes prolonged spasm) of the infarct 
related blood vessel.Myocardial ischemia and necrosis 
occurs from subendocardial to subepicardial region. 
The entire process takes 6 hours to complete. 
Types: 
l.S. T Elevation MI: ECG shows changes of S. T.
Elevation 
& Elevation of cardiac enzymes.
2.Non S. T. Elevation MI: ECG does not shows S.T.
Elevation but cardiac enzymes are raised.
Clinical 
Features 
A.Symptoms:
1.Pain in chest: Pain in chest is a cardinal
symptom ofacute myocardial infarction. It 
is abrupt in onset. The site and radiation is
like 
that of angina pectoris, but there may
be no pain in chest even with extensive
myocardial infarction, especially in long
standing diabetics.
2.Breathlessness: Breathlessness is actually
present with pain, but rarely it may be the
only presenting symptom.
3.Vomiting: It is a common feature especially

( 5 ) Cardiovascular System 
in severe cases and is often associated with 
cardiogenic shock. 
4.Collapse: The patient maybe pale, ashen grey
orcyanosed with intense perspiration. The
patient may be restless, excited and rarely
unconscious.
B.Signs:
l.Pulse: Fast and feeble pulse is usually
present.
2.BP: Initially there isa rise in BP, which may
be followed by a fall especially if cardiogen ic
shock occurs.
3.Heart sound: The heart sounds are usually
muffled. A third heart sound gallop may
be heard with a typical tic-tac rhythm.
4.Lung signs: The lungs may be normal or a
few basal rales may be auscultated if there
is left ventricular failure.
5.Late signs: On the second or third day mild
fever of38-39 C may occur. Pericardia! rub
may transiently appear around the same
time.

Investigations 
I.Non-specific tests: Polymorphonuclear
leucocytosis with high ESR may be seen in the
first week due to tissue necrosis.
II.ECG changes: The earliest change is ST segment
elevation with the onset of pain. Q waves appear
when transmural infarction occurs. By about 24
hours ST Segment reverts to normal and T wave
becomes inverted.In the leads opposite to the site ofinfarction there 
is ST depression even earlier than ST segment 
elevation (Reciprocal Changes). 
Depending upon the area involved these changes 
are seen in respective leads: 
I.Anterior: I, aVL. V1 -V6 
2.Lateral: V5V6
3.Antero-septal: V.,-V�
4.Medial: V1-V2 
5.Inferior: II, III, a VF
6.Right Ventricular: ST deviation in V_1R
7.Posterior: ST depression with tall T and R
in v. and v2
New onset LBBB: May be sign of AMI requiring 
thrombolysis 
III.Serum Enzymes: Myocardial necrosis leads
to liberation of certain enzymes which may
be elevated in blood, SGOT, LDH, Troponin
and CPK levels rise. The isoenzymes Troponin
and CPK (MB fraction) are more specific for
myocardial infarction. The importance of these
is as follows:

IV.Echocardiography: This detects myocardial
ischemia almost immediately by showing
regional wall motion abnormality.
V.Angiography: Done when Primary Percutaneous
Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) has
to be performed.
Differential Diagnosis 
I.Pulmonar y embolism: Massive pulmonary
embolism may mimic coronary artery disease.
However, cyanosis and tachypnea is more.
215 

Usually, it occurs in postoperative patient or 
those with prolonged immobilization. ECG 
would show typically prominent S wave in I and 
Q wave and inverted T wave in III (SlQ3T3). 
2.Acute pericarditis: The pain is either precordial
or substernal and radiates to the shoulder.
However, it is not related to exertion or meals.
Pericardial rub may be present. ECG shows ST
elevation with concavity upwards.
3.Pneumothorax: Left sided pneumothorax
may cause chest pain, which has no relation to
exertion but increases in inspiration. There is
shift of mediastinum to the opposite side and
diminished breath sounds.
4.Gastrointestinal hemorrhage: Gastric
hemorrhage patient may have epigastric and
substernal pain with vomiting and cold limbs
and this resembles acute myocardial infarction.
Usually stools would be black and ECG would
not show the changes of infarction.
5.Acute pancreatitis: Epigastrium pain usually
goes to the back, but otherwise it may be confused
with acute myocardial infarction. Here, serum
amylase is usually high.
Management 
J.General Measures:
216 1.Coronary Care Unit (CCU): Patients with a
presumptive diagnosis of acute myocardial
infarction (AMI) should be admitted to a
CCU for continuous ECG monitoring. The
CCU makes available trained personnel,
facilities and equipment to deal with
disturbance of cardiac rhythm and pump
function. Uncomplicated patients can be
transferred out of CCU after 3 days.
2.Activity: Bed rest must be given at least
for the first 24-48 hours. The traditional 
approach is to prescribe prolonged bed rest 
because early ambulation may precipitate 
arrhythmias and heart failure, cause 
extension of the infarction and later lead to 
the development of ventricular aneurysm 
and rupture. With uncomplicated 
myocardial infarction, mobilization can 
be started by the second day and patient PRACTICAL MEDICIN E 
discharged after 7 days, without a higher 
risk of reinfarction, arrhythmias and 
sudden death. However, in patients with 
anteroseptal myocardial infarction and 
bundle branch block, the risk of late, in­
hospital, death after being discharged from 
the coronary care unit is higher. 
The case against prolonged bed rest has 
been that it can lead to development 
of thrombophlebitis and pulmonary 
embolism. Th is risk is usually not commonly 
seen in our population, especially if the 
patient is on anticoagulants. Stool softeners 
or laxatives should be given to prevent 
straining while passing stools. 
3.Oxygen: Oxygen (nasal mask) at the rate
of 2 liters/min for at least 4 6 hours per
day should be given initially. Patients with
any degree of arterial hypoxemia whether
resulting from acute pulmonary congestion
or preexisting lung disease should receive
oxygen and have serial arterial oxygen
measurements to assess the efficacy of 
treatment.
4.Diet: Usually a diet of 1500 calories of
soft food with increased bulk ( to prevent
constipation) and no added salt is given.
Obese patients are made to lose extra fat
during this time. Initially (for the first 24
hours only) liquids and fruits are advised.
Feedings should be small and frequent i.e.
4-
7 times a day. Oral fluid intake should be
around 2 liters/day. Diet light in texture
minimizes the risk of aspiration in case of
cardiac arrest.
5.Control of chest pain:
a.Sublingual nitroglycerine 0.3 -0.4
mg should be repeated every 5-10
min until chest pain is relieved or 
tachycardia and hypotension occurs.
b.Beta-blockers: Metoprolol 5 mg IV
over 2 minutes. Repeated after 5 min
for 3 doses.
c.Morphine hydrochloride 15 mg SC
or 2-4 mg IV slowly should be given
if the chest pain is not relieved by

( 5 ) Cardiovascular System 
nitrates in 30 min. Morphine has 
vagotonic effects. Hence, in inferior 
wall infarction with conduction 
disturbances, pethidine 50100 mg 
IM is preferred. Pentazocin with 
diphenylhdramine is the alternative 
if morphine is not available. 
6.Prevention of ventricular fibrillation: All
patients were earlier treated with lidocaine
to prevent ventricular fibrillation especially
if there is no cardiac failure or shock.
However, this is no longer indicated.
Reperfusion Therapy 
J.During the first 12 hours (Hyperacute phase)
A. Intravenous thrombolysis: Thrombolysis
should be given within 3 hours ofi nfarction 
but can be given upto 12 hours. The agents 
used are: 
i.Streptokinase : 7,50,000 to 15,00,000
units over 30-60 minutes.
ii.Urokinase : 15,00,000 units over 30-60
minutes.
iii.Fibrin Specific Agents:
l.Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA)
(15 mg bolus IV followed by 50 mg
IV over 30 min followed by 35 mg IV
over 60 mins).
2.Tenecteplase (TNX} 0.53 mg/kg over
10 sec
3.Reteplase{rPA) lOmillion units bolus
over 2·3 min, which is repeated after
30min.
B.Mechanism of Action
1.Streptokinase binds to plasminogen
to form an activator complex that
converts it to plasmin, which lyses
the thrombus.
2.Urokinase, a product of human renal
tubular cells acts as a direct activator of
the fibrinolytic system. It is more clot­
specific than streptoki nase and causes
less bleeding complication, reduction
of fibrinogen and antigenicity.3.Tissue-type plasminogen activator
(tPA) and other fibrin specific
antithrombolytics have greater clot
selectivity than streptokinase or
urokinase and tPA at therapeutic doses 
does not cause systemic fibrinolysis.
Recently large quantities of tPA have 
been obtained by successful cloning
and expression of human tPA gene in 
Escherichia coli.
Indications /or thrombolysis: 
Thrombolytic agents are indicated in the 
first 3 hours after onset of symptoms and 
are alternative to primary PTCA due to 
logistic difficulties with PTCA. 
Contraindicated in patients with active 
bleeding, BP> 180 mmHg SBP, or >110 
mmHg DBP, H/0 hemorrhagic CVA at any 
time in the past, non-hemorrhagic CVA in 
last l year and aortic dissection. Relative 
contraindications are pregnancy. peptic 
ulcer, breathing diathesis, major surgery 
in last 2 weeks, use of streptokinase in last 
2 years. 
Side Effects : Allergic reaction to 
streptokina se, hypotension, bleeding 
B.Percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty (PTCA):
It is the best therapy for patients with
STEMI. It implies balloon dilatation of the
stenosed infarct-related artery. It is usually
accompanied by non-balloon techniques:
l.Stents: Bare-metal stents or Drug-

2.Thrombus aspiration devices to
aspirate large thrombus burden in a
STEMI.
3.Atherectomy Devices for coronary
calcific deposits
C.Pharmaco-invasive Therapy: It is a
combination of thrombolysis & coronary
angioplasty (PTCA). It is used when there
could be a delay in transfering the patient
to a center where PTCA is possible. Thus
full dose thrombol ysis is given to the patient
followed by immediate transfer to a PTCA
centre. PTCA is planned within 2-12 hours
of thrombolytic therapy.
D. Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG):
CABG is a well-established and safe method
to restore myocardial perfusion. It is rarely
required in an emergency setting. It is useful
in the following groups of patients:
l.Multivessel coronary disease (Triple
vessel disease or > 2 vessels involved
including proximal LAD)
2.Left main coronary artery stenosis
3. Patients in whom PTCA or
thrombolysis are ineffective
4.Patients with mechanical
complications like acute mitral
regurgitation.
II.Between 12 hours and 3 days (Acute Phase)
During this phase the effort of the physician is
to limit the infarct size by decreasing oxygen
consumption and decreasing the incidence of
cardiac arrhythmias and failure.
218 A.Anticoagulation: Administration of
anticoagulants helps to reduce thrombo­
phlebitis and pulmonary embolism. A
mini-dose of heparin 2000-5000 units
every 6-8 hourly initially and then given
every 8-12 hours subcutaneousl y, for
the first 4-5 days, is recommended. Now
conventional heparins are being replaced
by low molecular weight (LMW) heparinsPRACTICAL MEDICINE 
(See Management of Unstable Angina). 
Later, long-term anticoagu lation for 
uncomplicated infarcts is controversial, but 
there is an agreement that anticoagulants 
must be administered only in the hospital. 
In patients of AMI, strokes resulting from 
embolization of left ventricular mural 
thrombi to the brain occur predominantly 
(23 times) in patients with high creatinine 
kinase levels (over 8 times normal). In 
such patients full dose heparinization 
may prevent the formation of large left 
ventricular thrombi and decrease the risk 
of cerebrovascular accident. 
Anticoagulants are also useful to prevent 
AMI in unstable angina and occurrence of 
re-occlusion after thrombolytic therapy has 
restored perfusion of the artery. 
B.Anti-platelet Agents: Aspirin 325 mg
stat followed by 75-150 mg/day with
Clopidogrel 300 mg stat followed by 75 mg/
day. GpIIb/Illa Inhibitors may be used in
Facilitated PTCA.
C.Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs: Beta­
blockers reduce myocardial oxygen
consumption by reducing the heart
rate, blood pressure and myocardial
contractility. They redistribute blood to
ischemic areas and augment collateral
blood flow. In addition, they inhibit platelet
aggregation and shift the oxyhemoglobin
dissociation curve to the right. Patients
with hyperkinetic circulation, anxiety
and without cardiac failure, conduction
disturbances or bronchospasm are ideal
candidates for beta-blockers. Propranolol
1 mg IV is given every 5-10 min up to a
total dose of 0.1 mg/kg. Oral therapy can
then be started. Metoprolol or Atenolol can
be given 5 mg every 2-3 min up to 3 doses
followed by 100 mg BD orally.
D.Calcium channel blockers: In acute
myocardial infarction, nifedipine not
only does not decrease infarct size but
may increase the ischemic damage due
to decreased perfusion pressure and

( 5 > Cardiovascular System 
reflex tachycardia. However, in cases with 
recurrent or persistent ischemia after 
myocardial infarction, especially where 
the pathogenetic mechanism is likely to 
be coronary vasospasm, it is useful. It is 
also used if beta-blockers or nitrates are 
not tolerated or are contraindicated. 
E.ACE inhibitors or ARB decrease ventricular
remodeling and therefore decrease
mortality and are used in all AMI patients
specially if associated with decreased KV
function (e.g. Ramipril or Losartan (See
Ch. 15 for details)).
F.Nitroglycerine and Nitrates: Nitrates reduce
infarct size by reducing preload increasing
collateral blood flow to the ischemic
zone and relieving coronary vasospasm.
Nitroglycerine (NTG) can be given
sublingually or as ointment. For severe
and recurrent angina I. V. NTG is given
at 10 mcg/min., increased every 5 min.
by 10 mcg/min. until angina is controlled
or systolic BP is less than 100 mmHg or
the dose has reached 200 mcg/min. If the
patient's condition is stabilized for 48 hours
and no re-infarction occurs. I.V. NTG is
discontinued and the patient put on oral
nitroglycerine or isosorbide dinitrate.
I.V. NTG is given to patients who are
normotensive with left ventricular failure
(Pulmonary wedge pressure> 16 mmHg
and cardiacindex less than 2.5 L/min/M2).
G.Nitroprusside (NP): NP is useful for
hypertensive patients, in the dose of I 0
mcg/min and increased every 5 minutes
by 5 mcg/min until angina is controlled
or systolic BP is 120 mmHg. If there is no
cardiac failure it can be combined with
beta-blockers, which will prevent reflex
tachycardia.
H.Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation
(IABP): This helps to maintain circulatory
support for patients with cardiogenic shock.
It favorably affects myocardial oxygen
balance by decreasing demand ( deflation
of the balloon decreases the afterload)and increasing supply, (inflation of the 
balloon in diastole increase coronary 
perfusion pressure). However, because of 
the significant rate of complications and 
logistic difficulties associated with IABP, 
it is reserved only for very severe cases of 
angina not responding to other measures. 
Prognosis

Common Mechanisms of Death 
Following Myocardial Infarction 
1.First few hours -Ventricular Fibrillation
2.First few days -Pump failure
3. First few months -Reinfarction
Treatment of Complications 
Left Ventricular Failure 
A.Diuretics: Furosemide 20-40 mg IV every 6
hourly is given if there is dyspnea or hypoxia,
especially if pulmonary wedge pressure is over
18 mmHg. It favorable alters the myocardial
oxygen supply by reducing left ventricular end
diastolic volume and tension, which not only
decreases myocardial oxygen demand but also
increases coronary perfusion. However, it must
be used carefully in mild failure brisk diuresis
may reduce left ventricular filling pressure,
activate renin-angiotensin system and arginine
vasoconstriction, deteriorating the patient.
219 

B.Vasodilators: Vasodilators like nitroglycerine
(NTG) and Nitroprusside (NP) have beneficial
hemodynamic effects in heart failure. They
are most useful if the myocardial infarction
is complicated by ventricular septa( rupture
or mitral regurgitation. The dose of these
drugs should be adjusted such that pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure is less than 20 mmHg
and cardiac index greater than 2 5 L/min/M2.
If blood pressure is less than 90 mmHg it must
be combined with Dobutamine.
C.Digitalis: This is useful if there is cardiomegaly
prior to ischemic episode or there is supra
ventricular tachycardia.
D. Beta adrenergic agonists:D obutamine is a
synthetic sympathomimetic amine which does
not alter the heart rate and blood pressure and
does not increase the oxygen consumption of
the heart. It is given in the dose of 2-15 mcg/
kg/min. It increases the coronary and skeletal
muscle perfusion over mesenteric and renal
perfusion.
Dopamine, an endogenous catecholamine, exerts
it inotropic effect directly on the myocardial
beta receptors and indirectly by releasing
norepinephrine. It has a direct renal and
mesenteric vasodilating effect in doses below
15 mcg/kg/min. It increases cardiac output and
blood pressure. At higher doses it acts as arterial
and arteriolar vasoconstrictor. Hence, initially
dobutamine is the drug of choice. Ifhypotension
does not respond, dopamine followed by
norepinephrine is indicated.
Hypotension 
A.Hypovo/emia: Patients with acute myocardial
infarction having peripheral hypoperfusion,
in absence of pulmonary congestion and
compensatory tachycardia should be given
intravenous fluids. If blood pressure and
peripheralperfusionnormalize,nohemodynamic
monitoring is required, otherwise it is required
and fluids adjusted to achieve a pulmonar y wedge
pressure of about 20 mm Hg. If pulse rate is slow,
intravenous atropine can be given to raise the
heart rate of90-I00 beats/min.
B.Right ventricular infarction: This is seen
220 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
with inferior or inferio-posterior infarction 
with hypotension in absence of pulmonar y 
congestion. This is best treated with volume 
expansion, isoproterenol and dobutamine. 
C.Hypotension with normal systemic vascular

6 Cardiac Failure 
Definition 
Cardiac failure is a condition where the heart fails 10 
maintain an output sufficient for the needs of the body. 
It is usually a disturbance of ventricular function. 
Classification 
I.Low Output or High Output
l.Low output cardiac failure: There is primarily
a lesion in the heart, which decreases the
contractibi lityoftheheart,and causesdiminished
cardiac output.
2.High output cardiac failure: There is primarily
no lesion in the heart, but due to extra-cardiac
conditions there is increased work load on the
heart which causes cardiac failure with increased
cardiac output.
Causes 
l.Low output failure:
A. Myocardial lesion:
l.Ischemic heart disease
2.Rheumatic heart disease
3.Myocarditis and cardiomyopathies
B.Endocardial lesion:
l.Valvular lesion: Mitra!, aortic,
tricuspid and pulmonary stenotic or 
regurgitant defects
2.Infective endocarditis
C. Pericarditis with or without effusion
D.Congenital heart 
diseases: PDA, VSD, ASD,
etc.

II.Left Sided or Right Sided Cardiac Failure (given
below)
III.Systolic or Diastolic Cardiac Failure
I.Systolic Cardiac Failure : It results from
impaired systolic function and reduced
cardiac output. Usually seen in Ischemic
Heart Disease. It is managed mainly
by ionotropic agents e.g. Dopamine ,
Dobutamine and Digoxin.
2.Diastolic Cardiac Failure (Heart Failure
with a normal ejection fraction (HFNEF)
: It results from impaired diastole or
reduced relaxation and ventricular filling.
It is usually seen in systemic hypertension,
constrict ive pericarditis, restrictive
cardiomyopathy and IHD. It is managed
with vasodilators (ACE Inhibitors or
Calcium Channel Blockers).
Clinical Features 
I.Left Ventricular failure
A.Symptoms
1.Due to back pressure effect: Inability
of the left ventricle to eject adequate
blood leads to congestion in the
pulmonary blood vessels. This
causes exertional breathlessness. As
the disease progress breathlessness
increases and occurs even at rest. The
patient maybe comfortable only in the
propped up position and increased
vital capacity due to lowering of the
diaphragm. Later the patient maybe breathless even in propped up 
position (orthopnea). 
Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and 
cough commonly occurs because 
of reduced vital capacity in supine 
position, reabsorption of tissue 
fluids from the lower limbs into the 
circulation and depressed respiratory 
center during sleep. The attacks are 
classically precipitated at night and 
may be characterized by sudden 
awakening with extreme suffocation, 
cyanosis, perspiration and air hunger. 
The patient may cough up frothy 
sputum, which may be pinkish (due 
to pulmonary edema). The episode 
may last from 5-20 minutes or more. 
2.Due to reduction in forward flow: due
to inadequate output ofleft ventricle.
Blood flow to the vital organ suffers
resulting in mental confusion,
insomnia weakness and fatigue.
B.Signs
1.Gallop rhythm: Gallop rhythm or triple
rhythm occurs due to the audibility
of third or fourth heart sounds which
resembles the sounds produced by
galloping of horses. Normally in
an adult only two heart sounds are
heard. In cardiac failure, there is
increased resistance to filling of left
ventricle, hence blood flow through
the atrio-ventri cle valve is prolonged
and results in the third or fourth heart
sound. Associated with tachycardia it
produces the classical tic-tac rhythm.
2.Pulsus alternans: Left ventricular
failure alters the contractile forces of
the heart, which may cause alternate
large and small pulses without any
change in rhythm.
3.Basal rales: Due to back pressure and
congestion of the Ju ngs, rales may be
heard at both the lung bases initially
and later throughout the lung fields.
Fluid collection in the interstitial
221 

spaces may cause rhonchi even in the 
absence of rales. 
4.Cheyne Stokes respiration: This is 
alternate periods of apnea and
hyperpnea, which occurs due to left
ventricular failure. Signs of cardiac
enlargement and of the causative
disease may be present.
II. Right Ventricular Failure
222 A.Symptoms
1.Due to back pressure:
a.Pulmonary: Cough, dyspnea and
hemoptysis
b.Portal: Anorexia, nausea,
vomiting, abdominal fullness
after meals and pain in the right
hypochondriac region
c.Renal: Nocturia and oliguria
d. Peripheral: Edema of feet.
2.Due to diminished cardiac output:
Weakness and fatigue
B.Signs
I.Raised jugular venous pressure:
Normally at 45� position of the
patient, the jugular veins are not
visible. In cardiac failure, it is visible
in the neck and at times may reach
up to the angle of the sternum.
2.Hepatomegaly: Liver is enlarged and
tender due to congestion; systolic
pulsations may be present if there is
tricuspid regurgitation.
3.Edema: Edemaclassicallyoccursover
the legs and is pitting in character. If
the patient has been continuously
supine, edema may not be present
over the legs but may be present over
the sacrum because in that position,
it is the most dependent part.
4.Signs of TR and RV Enlargement:

sided heart failure may be present. 
B-Type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP): It is released
by the ventricle in response to stretch or elevated
filling pressures. It can be measured in the blood
and is very useful in diagnosis, monitoring and
prognosis of heart failure. BNP levels are very
sensitive and specific for heart failure. BNP less 
than 100 pg/ml rules out cardiac failure. 
Management 
The treatment of cardiac failure aims at restoring the 
balance between the metabolic demands of the body 
and he heart's ability to meet these demands. 
1.Rest: Complete bed-rest is the keystone of
treatment. When the patient is dyspneic, bed­
rest is given with the head end of the bed raised
to 45". The legs should be kept below the pelvis
to prevent the fluid present in the legs to return
to vascular system and precipitate pulmonary
edema. Once weight loss and adequate diuresis
occur, the patient may be allowed to sit on the
bedside chair or use a bedside commode and
he can be gradually mobilized. Prolonged bed­
rest may predispose to venous thrombosis and
pulmonary embolism, which can be prevented
by leg exercise and elastic bandage wrapped
around the legs.
2.Diet: The basic aim is to restrict sodium in diet.
The amount of salt to be restricted depends
upon the severity of cardiac failure. Normal diet
contains l O· l 5 gm of sodium chloride or 46 gm 
of sodium. On avoiding salt in food and table
salt this can be reduced to 2-4 gm of sodium/day
and on completely avoiding salt in preparation,
this can be further reduced to l gm sodium/day.
Salt substitutes may be used to make the diet
more palatable.
Due to edematous gastrointest inal tract,
digestion and absorption are poor. In addition,
larger meal may cause pooling of blood to the
gastrointestinal tract, thereby interfering with
diuresis. Hence, instead of the traditional three
meals, it is advisable to give frequent, small,
liquid feeds.

( 5 > Cardiovascular System 
3. 
4. If the patient is obese, loss of weight must be 
achieved by strict caloric restriction. 
Usually fluid restriction is not required in cardiac 
failure. However, if edema is present with low 
serum sodium, fluids should be restricted. 
Diuretics: In cardiac failure, there is always 
sodium and water retention. Hence diuretics are 
given to increase sodium extract ion. Furosemide 
40 mg orally or parenterally is a very potent 
and the most commonly used diuretic. Since 
the diuretic response is dose related, it can be 
increased if required. Since furosemide results 
in loss of sodium, chloride and potassium 
ions, the latter should be supplemented orally 
either as potassium chloride or as orange juice 
and coconut water, both of which are rich in 
potassium. Alternately, potassium sparing 
diuretics like spironolactone 25 mg four times 
a day, triamterene or amiloride hydrochloride 
can be used along with it. 
Other diuretics used are Torsemide, 
Hydrochlorthiaz ide, Chlorthalidone, 
lndapamide, Metolazone. 
Some patients with mild cardiac failure can be 
satisfactorily treated with a diuretic alone. Most 
patients will however require additional therapy. 
Failure of diuretic therapy may be due to high 
salt intake, electrolyte disturbances, inadequate 
renal perfusion or severe reduction in cardiac 
output. 
With the use of all diuretics it must be 
remembered that the compromised left ventricle 
is dependent on its preload to maintain the 
cardiac output. 
Digitalis: Digitalis and the related cardiac 
glycosides have a direct cardiotonic action. They 
increase the force of myocardial contraction and 
decrease the work of the heart. Digitalis can be 
administered intravenously, intramuscularly or 
orally, rapidly or slowly. In rapid digitalization 
full digitalization is achieved within 24 hours 
and is usually given parenterally. Ifthe patient is 
already on digitalis or has only recently stopped 
it, rapid digitalization parenterally may cause 
toxicity and hence it should be given orally. 
The commonly used drug is digoxin (0.25 mg 5. 
6. tablets). The usual digitalizing dose is 1.5 mg. 
For maintenance 0.25 mg daily is adequate. 
Sympathomimetic amines: Catecholamines 
stimulate the cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors 
and can be used to treat cardiac failure, but their 
effect increases the oxygen consumption and 
increases the work of the heart. Newer agents 
are free of these side effects and have been used 
in the treatment of acute and chronic cardiac 
failure. 
a.Dopamine: At low doses of 3-5 mcg/kg/
min. dopamine increases the contractility
of the heart by direct stimulation of
the beta-ad
renergic receptors cause
vasoconstriction in all the vascular
beds which increases arterial pressure,
peripheral resistance and myocardial
oxygen consumption. In severe cardiac
failure dopamine can be combined with
nitroprusside, which 
reduces afterload and
thus increases cardiac output and decrease
filling pressure.
b.Dobutamine: It has a predominant effect on
the cardiac beta-l receptors with very slight
activity on the vascular alpha and beta-2
receptors. At infusion rates of2.5-15 mcg/
kg min. it increases cardiaccontractilityand
cardiac output, decreases filling pressure
and causes minimal change in peripheral
resistance. In acute myocardial infarction
dobutamine increases cardiac output by
20% without 
altering the heart rate or blood
pressure. Dobutamine increases collateral
flow to the ischemic myocardium, thereby
reducing the infarct size. The inotropic
effects 
of dopamine do not persist beyond24
hours whereas those of dobutamine persist.
Both these drugs are complimentary and
can be used 
together, dopamine is useful in
hypotension, dobutamine is useful in low
cardiac output because it causes reduction
in filling pressures.
Bipyridines: These are non-glycoside 
positive 
inotropic agents that are affective both orally 
and intravenously. They reduce right and 
left ventricular filling pressures and systemic 
223 

7. 
224 vascular resistance with increase in cardiac 
output. This effect persists beyond 24 hours 
unlike dopamine. The two drugs useful in this 
group are Amrinone and milrinone. 
Amrinone is given intravenou sly as a bolus 
of 0.75 mg/kg over 2-3 minutes followed 
by a maintenance infusion of 5-10 mg/kg/ 
min. The side effects that can occur are fever, 
thromboc ytopenia, nephrogenic diabetes 
insipidus, hepatitis and gastrointestinal 
disturbances. 
Milrinonederived from amrinone, is more potent 
and with lesser side effects. 
Vasodilators: In cardiac failure with loss of 
cardiac reverse, an increase in compensatory 
afterload results in increase in end-diastolic 
volume and pressure accompanied by a reduction 
in stroke volume. Vasodilators are useful by 
reducing afterload. They can be subdivided into 
those with a predominant action on the venous 
system (venodilators), those with a predominant 
action on the arterial system (arterial dilators) 
and those that have relatively equal effects on 
both the systems (balanced dilators). 
a.Nitroprusside: Sodium nitroprusside acts
directlyon the vascular smooth muscle and
has a balanced dilator effect which reduces
pulmonary congestion and increases
cardiac output. It has a rapid onset ofact ion
and short half-life. It is given in the dose
of5-l0 mcg/min and increased every 10·
15 min by 5-10 mcg until the pulmonar y
wedge pressure has reduced to 18 mmHg
or side effects occur.
b.Nitrates: They act as predominant veno­
dilators with mild effects on the arterial
system and increase the cardiac output by
about 18-25%.
Sustained reduction in left ventricular
filling pressure occurs for 4-5 hours with
20 mg oforal isosorbide, for 1-5 hours with
sublingual administration and for 3-6 hours
with cutaneous administration.
IV nitroglycerine can be used in cardiac
failure where predominant vasodilatationPRACTICAL MEDICINE 
is needed with elevated filling pressures, 
an acceptable cardiac output and normal 
blood pressure. It is started at 5-10 mcg/ 
min. and increased by 10 mcg every 10-15 
min. to a total dose of 100-200 mcg/min. 
c.Hydralazine: It is an arterial dilator which
produces slight decrease in BP, large
decrease in systemic arterial resistance and
25-70% increase in cardiac output. Usually
it is given in the dose of 25 mg 6 hourly
and increased gradually up to 100 mg 6
hourly. In this dose lupus erythematosus
may occur in 15% of patients. It is usually
combined with nitrates or nitroprusside.
d.Prazosin: This reduces the peripheral
resistance by blocking the vascular alpha-I­
ad renergic receptors. Decreases in arterial
and left ventricular filling pressures, as
well as systemic vascular resistance and
increases in cardiac output result from
both arterial and venous dilation.
With acute use, heart size decreases and
treadmill exercise performance improves.
However, tolerance develops on continuous
use, which does not improve by increasing
the dose but by adding a diuretic. The
initial dose is I mg increased gradually to
a maximum of 10 mg/day.
e. Angiotensin- Converting Enzyme inhibitors:
Captopril is a balanced vasodilator that
dilates both venous and arterial systems
and thus reduces both the preload and
afterload and increases cardiac output. Peak
effects are observed within 90 min following
oral administration. Renal perfusion is
selectively increased out of proportion to
the increase in cardiac output. Caution
must be exerted if it is used with venous
dilators like nitrates. The usual dose initially
is 6.25 mg three to four times gradually
increased to 50-100 mg four times. Other
ACE Inhibitors include Enalapril, Ranipril,
Lisinopril and Quinapril. They can lead
to adverse reactions like dry cough,
angioedema, hyperkalemia and raised
creatinine.

( 5 ) Cardiovascular System 
In case patients are intolerant to ACE­
Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers 
(ARBs) can be used. They include drugs 
like Losartan, Valsartan, Telmisartan, 
Olmisartan and Candisartan. They are 
less likely to produce cough as compared 
to ACE-Inhibitors. 
f.Nesiritide : Recombinant BNP. It is a
vasodilator used in refractory cardiac
failure. It is given intravenously in a bolus
of 2 µg/kg followed by an IV infusion of
0.01 µg/kg/min.
8.Inodilator Levosimendan : It is a calcium
channel sensitizer. It has a positive ionotropic
and vasodilatory effect. It is used in acute
decompensated cardiac failure. It is given
intravenously in a loading 
dose of6-12 µg/kg/
minute over 10 minutes followed by 0.05 -
2 µg/
kg/min infusion.
9.Oxygen: Oxygen ( through Woulfe's bottle) at the
rate of 5-8 liters/min should be given especially
in patients with lung disease, lung congestion
or coronary heart disease.
10.Miscellaneous
a.Tranquilizers: Diazepam 2-5 mg three times
a day or phenobarbitone 30-60 mg twice or
thrice 
a day is useful to aHay anxiety and
achieve adequate sleep.
b.Mechanical 
measures: In cases of ascites
or hydrothorax causing respiratory
discomfort, aspiration of fluid is helpful.
Massage of lower limbs to maintain
peripheral circulation helps to prevent
phlebothrombosis.
11.Cardiac 
Re-synchronization Therapy : Or
Biventricular Pacing : It is used in patients with
symptomatic refractory cardiac failure with
conduction abnormality or Left Bundle Branch
Block (LBBB). This therapy involves pacing the
right atrium, right ventricle and left ventricle to
improve 
synchrony of the cardiac chambers.
12.Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVADs): Like
Intra-aortic balloon pump. lmpella device,
Heart-Mate, Thoratic are considered when
medical management fails. They are usually used
as a bridge to cardiac 
transplant or CABG.Management of Acute Left Ventricular 
Failure (LVF)

comfortable to the patient.
2.Morphine: lSmgmorphine or lOOmgpethidine

They also caused dilation of veins 
reducing the
venous return to he heart.
3.Oxygen: 6-8 liters/min (through Wolfe's bottle)
is given.
4.Aminophylline: 250-500 mg. I.V. improves

5.Digitalis: Rapid digitalization is done
intravenously unless contraindicated.
6.Diuretics: Furosemide 40 mg. I.V. is given. It
may be given up to l 00 mg. if required.
7.BP Control: Vasopressors are given if BP is low
and hypotensives are given if BP is high.
8.Diet: Salt free diet is given till L VF improves.
Later, restricted salt diet is given.
9.Phlebotomy: Removal of500 ml of blood was
done in the 
past. It reduces the load in the heart
by reducing the venous return from 
the limbs to
the right atrium.
7 > Mitral 
Stenosis (MS) ___.__ __ _
Causes 
A.Rheumatic heart disease: Mitra! stenosis occurs
usually after 5 years age and is the commonest
cause of MS
B.Congenital: Mitral stenosis 
occurs early in life
and may be associated with other congenital
anomalies
C.Lutembacher's syndrome: Acquired MS + ASD.
D.Atherosclerosis in the elderly due to calcification
and fibrosis of the valve, valve ring and chordae
tendineae
E.Endomyocardial fibrosis
F.Hurler's syndrome: Due to deficiency of alpha-
1-iduronidase. There 
is corneal clouding,
growth and mental retardation, coarse features,
multivalvular, coronary, great vessel disease and
cardiomyopathy.
225 

Pathophysiology 
Tue essential fault is obstruction to the left ventricular 
inflow resulting in a rise in pressure in the left atrium 
and pulmonary circulation. For pulmonary blood flow, 
a pressure gradient of 10 mmHg must exist between 
pulmonary arteries and veins. As the pressure in the 
pulmonary veins increases, pressure in the pulmonary 
artery increases passively to maintain the gradient 
(passive pulmonary hypertension). When the left atrial 
pressure is above 20 mm Hg, pulmonary artery pressure 
rises very rapidly due to arteriolar constriction (active 
pulmonary hypertension). The vasoconstrict ion affects 
the muscular arteries of the lower lobe, which show 
medial hypertrophy. The upper lobe arteries are normal 
or even enlarged. 
The normal mitral valve area is 4 6 cm2 and the pres­
sure in the left atrium is normally 6-12 mm Hg. When 
it is reduced to < l cm2 it is severe and critical mitral 
stenosis. To maintain adequate cardiac output, the left 
atrial pressure increases and left atrial dilatation occurs. 
The left atrial pressure may reach 30 mm or higher. 
As the effective osmotic colloidal pressure of plasma 
is only 25 mmHg pulmonary edema will appear un­
less it is partly prevented by capillary thickening and 
pulmonary arterial vasoconstriction. However, this 
leads to pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular 
hypertrophy and failure and tricuspid regurgitation. 
Mechanism of Pulmonary Hypertension 
in Mitral Stenosis 
I.Due to back pressure left atrial pressure
increase causing an increase in pulmonary
vascular pressure and subsequently passive rise
in pulmonary artery pressure. This is passive
pulmonary hypertension.
2.Above a mean left atrial pressure of 20 mm
of mercury, pulmonary arterial pressure rises
rapidly irrespective ofleft atrial pressure due to
arteriolar constriction. This is active pulmonary
hypertension.
3.Interstitial edema in walls of small pulmonary
vessels
Pathological Types 
I.Leaflet type -stiff, rigid, calcified
2.Commissural type -fusion of commissures, but
no involvement of chordae or cusps
3.Chordae type • fused and thick chordae
226 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
Diagnostic Features 
Due to Mitral Stenosis (uncomplicated) 
A.Tapping apex beat occurs due to palpable first
heart sound (accentuated S1) combined with
backward displacement of the left ventricle by
enlarged right ventricle.
B.Mid-diastolic presysto/ic thrill in mitral area
C.Loud first heart sound because the cusps are kept
open until the onset of ventricular systole. As the
cusps become immobile, the loud first sound
softens. Therefore a loud S1 indicates pliable
mitral valve.
D.Opening snap is the sound that appears in early
diastole due to the opening of the mitral valve.
It disappears when cusps become immobile.
Normal A20S interval is 0.05 to 0.12 sec.
E.Mid-diastolic murmur with presystolic
accentuat ion. It is localized low pitched,
rumbling murmur best heard in the mitral area,
with the bell, when the patient is in the left lateral
position and holds the breath in expiration and is
accentuated by exercise. It occurs due to turbulent
flow of blood through the narrowed valve.

2.Postural syncope
3.Embolic episode in presence of sinus
rhythm as a presenting symptom
4.Third heart sound heard

myxoma from mitral stenosis. 
C.BALL VALVE THROMBU S: This mimics left
atrial myxoma and can be differentiated by

systolic murmur is present.
E.ATRIAL SEPTAL DEFECT: Fixed split S2 may
be confused for OS and diastolic flow murmur

Pathophysiology 
In mitral regurgitation, during systole, a portion 
of 
the left ventricular stroke volume is being ejected back 
into the left atrium rather than forward into the aorta. 
However, left ventricular function does not deteriorate 
till late. Since there is no obstruction to the flow across 
the mitral valve in diastole, left atrial pressure, is also 
not elevated in early stages and pulmonary venous 
and arterial hypertension too does not occur early. 
In late stages, left ventricle dilates to accommodate 
the increased volume. The increased wall tension 
and the increased myocardial mass from ventricular 
hypertrophy increase myocardial oxygen demand 
and ultimately leads to left ventricular failure. As the 
left ventricular filling pressure rises, there is increase 
in left atrial and pulmonary venous pressure leading 
to pulmonary venous and later pulmonary arterial 
hypertension. 
Symptoms 
A.Fatigue, weaknessB.Dyspnea, orthopnea, PND
C.SIS of pulmonary hypertension, RVF or atrial
fibrillation (Refer MS Pg. 225)
Diagnosis 
A.Low, collapsing pulse (Water-hammer pulse)
B.Hyperdynamic apex
C.Systolic thrill in the mitral area
D.Muffled first heart sound
E.Loud third heart sound (0.12-0.17 sec after S)
F.Widely split second heart sound, even in the
absence of pulmonary hypertension, because
of early closure of aortic valve.
G.Pansystolic murmur best heard in the mitral
area with the diaphragm and conducted to the
axilla and back. It is increased on exercise and
has no relation to respiration. Conducted to base
of heart if posterior mitral leaflet involved.
H.Flow murmur· Soft mid -diastolic murmur heard
only in severe MR.
I.If pulmonary hypertension is present, features
of pulmonary hypertension as mentioned with
mitral stenosis are present.
J.'Cooing' or 'musical' or 'seagull' quality of

rupture of chordae tendinae
Investigations 
I.ECG: The ECG may be normal in early stage.
l.Left atrial enlargement or overload pattern
appears if the patient is in sinus rhythm.
2.Left ventricular hypertrophy occurs as
regurgitation increases.
3.If pulmonary hypertension occurs

mitral regurgitation like mitral valve prolapse, infective 
endocarditis, ruptured chordae tendineae.

A.Medical:
1.In mildly symptomatic cases: Diuretics
like furosemide 40 mg daily, along
with digoxin 0.25 mg daily and salt
restriction is advised to reduce volume 
overload and give inotropic support
to the heart. 
2.In severe cases with advanced
functional disability vasodilators to
reduce both preload and afterload are
given. The former is done with nitrate
and latter with captopril 75-150 mg/
day or enalapril 10-20 mg/day.
235 

B.Surgical:
MitraJ regurgitation is well-tolerated lesion
with slow progression. Surgical mitral valve
repair (valvuloplasty or annuloplasty) or
valve replacement is done in the following
situation:
I.Severe mitral regurgitation (NYHA
Class III or IV)
2.Severe pulmonary hypertension
3.Progressive increase in LV size
demonstrated radiologically or by
Echocardiogram and hemodynamic
decompensation.
4.Ruptured chordae tendineae and
resistant infective endocarditis.
9 Mitral Valve Prolapse 
(MVP) 
(Synonyms: Barlow syn., floppy mitral 
valve, systolic click murmur syndrome, 
billowing mitral leaflet syn.) 
Mitral valve prolapse is commonly seen in young 
women with familial incidence. Usually posterior cusp 
prolapses. In Read's syndrome, both the anterior and 
posterior cusps prolapse and hence valve replacement 
is invariably required. 
Causes 
Its cause is unknown, but in some cases it may be a 
genetically determined collagen tissue disorder as 
sociated with: 
I.Normal variant: Mild MVP is so common that
it is regarded as a normal variant. It is often seen
in patients with anxiety neurosis.

ThyrotoxicosisPRACTICAL MEDICINE 
Pathophysiology 
The mitral valve leaflets may be large Alternatively 
there may be enlarged mitral annulus, abnormally long 
chordae or disordered papillary muscle contraction. 
Myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve may be 
present on histology. 
During ventricular systole, a mitral valve leaflet pro­
lapses into the left atrium that may cause abnormal 
ventricular contraction, and mitral regurgitation. 
Clinical Features 
I.Usually the patients are asymptomatic. There may
be atypical chest pain, angina or palpitations.
2.Mid-systolic (non ejection) click is heard due to
prolapse of the valve and tensing of the chordae
tendineae that occurs during systole 0.14 sec
after S1 
3. 
4. Late systolic murmur due to mitral regurgitation
may occur.
Click and murmur occur earlier with standing or
Valsalva maneuver (decreased LV volume) and
occur later with squatting or isometric handgrip
or exercise (increased LV volume).
Complications 
I.Severe MR
2.Endocarditis in patients with MR
3.Sudden death
4.Arrhythmias -ventricular and supraventricular
5.Chest pain
6.Embolic phenomenon
7.Transient ischemic attack (TIA)
Investigations 
I.Chest X-ray: This is usually normal unless there
is significant mitral regurgitation.
II.ECG: This may be normal or may show T wave
inversion in inferior (II, Ill and a VF) and lateral
(V • 
-V 6) leads.
Ill. Echocardiogram: This confirms the diagnosis 
by demonstrating both on M mode and 2-D. 
posterior movement of one or both mitral valve 
cusps into the left atrium during systole.

Causes 
A.Rheumatic feverB.Syphilis
C.Infective endocarditis
D.Congenital disorders:

2.Marfan's syn., Ehler-Dantos syn.
3.High VSD

6.Takayasu's arteritis
F.Severe systemic hypertension
G.Traumatic rupture of the cusp
H.Dissecting aneurysm of the ascending aorta
I.Large ventricular aneurysm
J.Following methysergide therapy
Pathophysiology 
In aortic regurgitation, blood flows back from the aorta 
into the left ventricle during diastole. To maintain ad­
equate cardiac output, total amount of blood pumped 
into aorta must increase and hence left ventricular 
size increases. Angina occurs not only because ofleft 
ventricle enlargement leading to increased requirement 
of blood, but also because the coronaries are filled in 
diastole and in AR, blood leaks back into the ventricles 
in diastole. In addition, in syphilitic patients, there is 
coronary osteitis, which reduces the coronary filling. 
Complications: Same as for MS
Diagnosis 
A.Blood Pressure: High systolic BP, low diastolic
BP (wide pulse pressure). Very often Korotkoff
sounds do not disappear and can be heard with
cuff deflated. In this case, the value at which the
sounds get muffled (phase IV) is regarded as
diastolic BP.
B.Hyperdynamic apex beat
237 

C.Diastolic thrill in the aortic area and third and
fourth left intercostal spaces in parasternal region
D.Second sound narrowly split with loud A2.
E.Early diastolic murmur, de crescendo, soft and
blowing, in the aortic area, over the midsternum
and to the left, transmitted to the apex, best heard
with the diaphragm and the patient leaning
forward and holding his-breath in expiration. If
the diastolic murmur is best heard to the right
of the sternum (aortic area) it suggests A.R. due
to dilatation of ascending aorta as in syphilis,
Marfan's syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis
and dissecting aneurism of ascending aorta. If
the diastolic murmur is better heard in left 3rd
intercostal space, it suggest A.R. due to pathology
of aortic valve as in rheumatic heart disease,
infective endocarditis etc.
!Fig.5.37 Earlyd1astol 1cmurmuro f AR
F. - ---- - -
Ejection systolic murmur in the aortic area due to 
increased stroke volume of left ventricle. It may 
be mistaken for aortic stenosis; however, in the 
latter the second sound is soft, whereas in pure 
aortic regurgitation it is often loud. 
G.Austin Flint murmur: This is the functional,
apical, diastolic murmur of free AR without any
lesion of the mitral valve. It occurs sometimes in
AR due to vibrations set up in the anterior mitral
leaflet as it oscillates between blood coming from
the left atrium and regurgitated from the aorta.
H.If pulmonary hypertension is also present there
will be signs of pulmonary hypertension as
mentioned for MS.
I.If there is left ventricular hypertrophy there is
dilatation of the mitral valve leading to signs of
mitral regurgitation.
J.Peripheral signs of wide pulse pressure.
238 I.Water-hammer pulse (Corrigan's pulse,
collapsing pulse)PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
*If Water-hammer pulse is absent in a case of aortic regur
gitation it suggests one of the following associated lesions:

3. Hypertension 4. Marked myocardial degeneration
2.Corrigan's sign (dancing carotids) · rapid

11 > Aortic 
Stenosis (AS) 
Causes 
A.Valvular stenosis:
1.Rheumatic heart disease
2.Atherosclerosis
3.Congenital malformations -bicuspid AV
4.Degenerative- sderocakific
B.Subvalvular stenosis: congenital
C.Supravalvular stenosis due to a ridge of fibrosis
tissue just above the sinus ofValsalva, Williams'
syn.
In a patient with aortic 
stenosis and aortic regurgita­
tion, aortic stenosis is not significant if there is: 
1.Rapid upstroke of pulse
2.Pulsus bisferiens
3.High systolic blood pressure
4.Absence of thrill
Pathophysiology 
Obstruction to the left ventricular outflow in aortic 
stenosis leads to left ventricular hypertrophy. Myo­
cardial ischemia may 
occur without coronary artery 
lesion due to increased requirement by the hypertro­
phied myocardium, which may lead to arrhythmias 
and sudden death. On exercise, the increase in cardiac 
output is not possible due to the obstruction to the left 
ventricular outflow and all the symptoms -dyspnea, 
angina and syncope are aggravated. Symptoms 
Angina, syncope, exertional dyspnea, fatigue, pulmo­
nary edema, sudden death 
Diagnosis 
A.Pulse: Small amplitude. Rises slowly and falls
slowly. There may be anacrotic pulse or pulsus
bisferiens.
B.Blood Pressure: Low systolic blood pressure with
narrowed pulse pressure (systolic cut-off ofBP)
C.Apex beat sustained and heaving in character,
pushed outwards and downwards.
D.Systolic thrill in the second right interspace and
along the carotids.
E.Ejection systolic murmur best 
heard in the
aortic area and at the apex and conducted to
the carotids. It is rough or harsh in character,
rising to a peak in mid systole and tapering
before the second heart sound. There is no
relation to respiration (Crescendo-decrescendo).
Gallavardin phenomenon -AS murmur
conducted to apex.
F.Second heart sound is soft or absent with narrower
reverse splitting.
G.Ejection systolic click may sometimes be heard
just before the onset of the 
murmur due to
the opening of a stenosed semi lunar valve.
It disappears with the calcification of valve.

Treatment 
Medical 
1.Patient with aorticstenosis must be advised to avoid
strenuous exertion and competitive sports.
2.Angina is best treated with beta-blockers, ACE
inhibitors, diuretics. Vasodilators and nitrites
are avoided as they may precipitate syncopal
attacks.
3.Prophylaxis against bacterial endocarditis must
be given (see mitral stenosis)4. Rheumatic fever prophylaxis
5.Treatment of cardiac failure
Surgical 
l. 
2. Balloon dilatation of aortic valve gives temporary 
relief from obstruction. 
Aortic valve replacement with a prosthetic or 
tissue valve should be done for everyone with 
aortic stenosis. 
Mechanism of syncope in Aortic Stenosis 
1. 
2. Due to reduced cardiac output there is 
reduced circulation to the brain. On exercise, 
vasodilatation occurs in the muscles due to 
utilization of metabolites, which furtherreduces 
the effective blood flow to the brain. 
If calcification occurs in the aortic valve, it may 
also affect the Bundle of His, which is very near. 
This may lead to heart block and Stokes Adams 
syndrome. 
3.If the patient is working at the peak of the
Starling's curve, exercise would not increase the 
required increased cardiac output.
Prognosis 
Life expectancy in patients developing angina is 4 yrs, 
syncope 3 yrs, dyspnea (LVF) 2 yrs. 
12 > Cyanotic Congenital 
Heart Disease 
Cyanotic congenital heart diseases are caused by ob­
struction to the right heart outflow associated with 
either an intracardiac or a great artery communication 
proximal to the obstruction. The level of obstruction 
and associated shunt is given in the Table: 
Eisenmenger's Physiology 
Eisenmenger's physiology is defined as pulmonary to 
systemic resistance ratio equal to or greater than one 
or absolute elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance 
to greater than 960 dyne sec cm·5 
Clinical Features 
In infancy patients present with failure to thrive, 
243 

recurrent respiratory infection and severe heart 
failure. 
2.In adolescence, exertional fatigue, dyspnea
and cyanosis develop. Hemoptysis is late and
preterminal.
3.Infectiveendocarditis, cerebral abscess, clubbing
and erythrocytosis causing dizziness, headache
fatigue and blurred vision may occur.
4.Differential cyanosis and clubbing occur in PDA
with right to left shunt. Reversed differential
clubbing and cyanosis ( clubbing and cyanosis of
fingers with pink toes) occurs in PDA with right
to left shunt and transposition of great vessels.
5.Supra-ventricular arrhythmias especially
atrial fibrillation occurs late and suggests right
ventricular failure. Syncope, sudden death or
death from minor surgery is common with
advanced pulmonary artery disease.
6.JVP shows prominent 'a' waves. If there is right
sided failure V waves would be prominent due
to tricuspid regurgitation.
7.Pulmonary second sound is loud. Fourth heart
sound and ejection click may be heard. If there
is right heart failure, third heart sound would
be heard.
8.Soft systolic murmur in the pulmonary area
along with Graham Steell's murmur replaces
the left-right shunt murmur.
9.ECG
a.There is right ventricular and right atrial
hypertrophy with right axis deviation.
b.Associated left ventricular hypertrophy

Acute hemorrhagic episodes may require platelet

Pregnancy and oral contraceptives should be 
avoided as they lead to pulmonary thrombosis 
and embolism. Tubal ligation carries risk from 
associated vasovagal effects. Intrauterine devices 
may cause bleeding in these patients who have 
abnormal hemostasis and also may predispose 
to infective endocarditis. 
For those with advance pregnancy and heart 
failure, bed-rest is necessary in last trimester. 
Oxygen may help. Spinal and general anesthesia 
should be avoided. Induced vaginal delivery and 
chemoprophylaxis for infective endocarditis 
must be given. 
Heart-Lung transplant may help and offers some 
hope at least for the future. 
Tetralogy of Fa/lot (TOF) 
Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cyanotic 
congenital heart disease presenting after 1 year of age. 
Fallot's· tetrad consists of: 
1.VSD (infracristal type)
2. Infundibular pulmonary stenosis
3.Overriding of aorta
4. Right ventricular hypertrophy.
Of these 4 features only the first two are of primary 
physiological importance. 
Fallot's Physiology (Hemodynamics in 
TOF) 
Pulmonary stenosis is the most physiologically impor­
tant defect (It results in RV hypertrophy). PS causes 
right heart pressure to be higher than left heart pres­
sure, which result in a "right-to-left" shunt across the 
VSD. The blood is also directly shunted into the aorta 
(which overrides the septum). 
The VSD is large and hence produces no murmur. The 
blood flow through the PS results in ejection systolic 
murmur. More severe the PS, more the shunting of 
deoxygenated blood through the VSD and into the 
aorta, thus leading to more cyanosis. Variants 
I.In 5% of cases the left anterior descending
coronary artery has an anomalous origin from
the right coronary artery or from the right sinus
ofValsalva
2.ASDor patent foramen ovate occur in 25% of
cases (pentalogy of Fa/lot's J.
3.Aortic regurgitation, secondary to bicuspid aortic
valve, infective endocarditis or aortic leaflet
prolapse may occur.
4.Acyanotic Fallot's: In some cases of Fallot's
tetrad, pulmonary stenosis is mild and hence
right ventricular pressure is lower than left
sided pressure. There is left to right shunt across
the VSD and the patient is not cyanosed but
pink.
5.ASD, PS with RVH (TrilogyofFallot)
Diagnosis 
A.Central cyanosis, clubbing and polycythemia.
Cyanosis occurs because of overriding of the
aorta and polycythemia because of hypoxia.
Cyanosis may appear at birth or after
B.Squatting episodes relieve breathlessness or
cyanotic spells because there is:
1.Compression of femoral artery which
increases the resistance to the left ventricular
outflow 
and left ventricle, thus reducing the
right to left shunt and hence more blood
goes to the lungs to be oxygenated.
2.Compression of femoral veins reduces
the venous return thus reducing the right
ventricular pressure and right to left shunt.
3.Diminished right to left shunt by the
above two mechanisms reduces the
acid metabolites reaching the brain and
depressing the respiration.
C.Hypoxic/Cyanotic attacks and syncope: Onset
usually during crying or after exertion. These
are characterized by crying, cyanosis, tachypnea,
syncope, convulsions and sometimes death.
It occurs due to systolic contraction of a
hypertrophied pulmonary infundibulum, which
causes cessation of pulmonary blood flow.
245 

D.Quiet heart: There is no right ventricular heave
in spite ofinfundibular stenosis because the right
ventricle can empty freely into the aorta.
E.Second heart sound is single and never loud.
Palpable A2 due to large aorta.
F.Pulmonary ejection systolic murmur due to
obstruction of the right ventricular outflow. It
disappears during hypoxic spells.
G.Continuous murmur due to bronchopulmonary
anastamosis (large aortopulmonary collaterals)
better heard in the back.
Investigations

2.Clock wise rotation.
3.Moderate right ventricular hypertrophy

4.RVH with or without RBBB
II.X-rays

a.Right ventricular hypertrophy lifts
the apex clear off the diaphragm.
b.Cap of the left ventricle above the apex

c.Pulmonary bay is deep due to
hypoplastic pulmonary artery.
2.Unilateral rib notching.
3.Oligemic lung fields.
III.Echocardiogram
Two-dimensional echocardiography and Color
Doppler helps not only to delineate VSD but
also to diagnose associated ASD and/or PDA.
Overriding of aorta can also be demonstrated.
Complications 
A. Syncope from infundibular hypertonus and
death.
B.Cerebral abscess occurs because:

1.Total Correction: This operation is deferred
up to the age 5-6 years. 
It involves closing
the VSD and resection of the Pulmonary
or infundibullar stenosis.
2.Palliative Shunt: If pulmonary arteries
are too hypoplastic, then before total
correction, palliative shunt operations
should be performed before 3 months.
In Palliative Surgery, a systemic artery is
anastomosed with the pulmonary artery
to increase the blood flow through the
pulmonary circulation for oxygenation.
The following shunts can be done:
A.Blalock Taussig Shunt • Subclavian
artery to pulmonary artery
anastomosis -preferred surgery
B.Waterston's Shunt -Ascending
Aorta to Right Pulmonary Artery
anastomosis
C.Pott's Shunt -Descending Aorta to
Left Pulmonary Artery anastomosis
3.Pulmonary Valvuloplasty: is sometimes
used before total correction.
4.Percutaneous Infundibular Resection of
the infundibular muscle using modified
atherectomy device is the latest technique.
Ebstein's Anomaly of Tri cuspid Valve 
In Ebstein's anomaly there is atrialization of the right 
ventricle, so that the tricuspid valve leaflets are dis­
placed away from the tricuspid valve annulus. The A-V 
node and His bundle may be compressed causing A-V 
dissociation first degree A-V block and right bundle 
branch block. 
Functional Effects 
There is right ventricular inflow obstructio n and 
tricuspid regurgitation. Due to increased right 
atrial pressure there is right to left shunt through an 
associated ASD with systemic desaturation.

2.Surgical: Tricuspid annuloplasty or valve
replacement with closure of ASD.
Tricuspid Atresia 
DEFINITION: Tricuspid atresia is absence of orifice 
between the right atrium and right ventricle. 
Both the atria are enlarged and thickened. In 40% 
there is patent foramen ovale and in the rest there is 
associated ASD. Mitral valve annulus is dilated with 
thickened valve leaflets. Left ventricle is enlarged and 
hypertrophied. Right ventricle is small or atretic. 
Associated Lesions 
1.Transposition of great vessels
2.Co-arctation of aorta
3.VSD
Clinical Features 
l.First and second heart sounds are single. Second
heart sound (aortic) may be loud.
2.Loud systolic 
murmur of VSD or Pulmonary
stenosis may be present. Decrease intensity of
this murmur with increasing cyanosis suggests
VSD closure.
3.Mid-diastolic mitral flow murmur may occur
4.Continuous thoracic bruits due to systemic-
pulmonary collaterals may be present.

2.Surgical: To increase pulmonary blood flow, a
Rashkin
d balloon septostomyor a shunt ( e.g. Glenn

{ 5 > Cardiovascular System 
or Blalock) is performed. If pulmonary flow is 
too great, PA banding is done in the first year of 
life. Correction of the defect is done after 2 years 
age using 'Fontan' atriopulmonary connection. 
PersistentTruncus Arteriosus (TA) 
Persistent truncus arteriosus consists of a single or 
common outflow trunk that arises from the base of the 
heart giving rise to systemic, pulmonary and coronary 
circulation. It is invariably associated with VSD. 
Pathophysiology 
If the pulmonary stenosis is not significant and VSD 
large, truncal pressure equals that of the ventricles and 
large pulmonary blood flow may lead to L. V. overload 
and cardiac failure. If however, there is significant pul­
monary stenosis, pulmonary blood flow is decreased 
and there is hypoxia but normal heart size. The patients 
in between these two extremes may survive for many 
years with near normal function. 
Clinical Features 
1.Patient presents with cardiac 
failure and cyanosis
2.Wide bounding pulse may be present.
3.Second sound is usually single; split may be
present due to extra-truncal vibrations. murmur
with a thrill may be present.
5.High 
pitched diastolic decrescendo murmur of
truncal regurgitation may be present.
Investiga tions 
I.X-ray chest
1.Marked rightward convexity with right
aortic arch
2.Cardiac 
pedicle is narrow due to absence
of prominent pulmonary artery
II.Echocardiography
Absence of pulmonary valve and demonstration
of the origin of the pulmonary artery from the
truncus establishes the diagnosis.
Treatment 
1.Medical: Treatment of cardiac failure
2.Surgical: VSD patch closure with placement of
conduit from the right ventricle to the pulmonaryartery and directing the left ventricle to the 
truncus. 
Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous 
Connections (TAPVC) 
In TAPVC, the 4 pulmonary veins converge in a 
common collecting sinus, from where the blood is 
drained into the right atrium through an anomalous 
venous drainage. 
TYPES: Supra cardiac, cardiac and infracardiac 
Pathophysiology 
Almost all patients with TAPVC have associated inter
­
atrial communication. Volume overload leads to right 
atrial, right ventricular and pulmonary hypertension. 
The clinical course depends upon whether pulmonary 
venous obstruction exists, the magnitude of right ven­
tricular outflow resistance and size of the interatrial 
communication. 
If there is obstruction to the pulmonary venous drain­
age, severe pulmonary edema or marked pulmonary 
hypertension occurs. If there is inadequate interatrial 
communication, right heart failure and pulmonary 
hypertension and pulmonary arteriolar disease ensues. 
Pulmonary stenosis may protect the individual from 
excessive pulmonary flow and heart failure. 
Clinical Features 
The clinical features resemble those of ASD associated 
with moderate cyanosis.

Treatment : Surgical correction 
Complete Transposition of Great Vessels 
(D Transposition, TGA) 
Transposition of great arteries (TGA) consists of the 
following: 
I.The great arteries arise from the wrong ventricles
i.e. the aorta arises from the right ventricle and
pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle
(D-loop).
2.The aorta is anterior to the pulmonary artery
3.The aorto-mitral continuity is absent.
Associated Lesions 
1.PDA
2.VSD
3.ASD
4.Patent foramen oval
5.Pulmonary stenosis
6.Coarctation of aorta
7.Straddling tricuspid valve
8.Juxtaposed atrial appendages
Pathophysiology 
Deoxygenated systemic venous blood from right 
ventricle enters the aorta and oxygenated pulmonary 
venous blood from the left ventricle enters the pulmo­
nary artery. Survival is not possible without an addi­
tional ASD or VSD. The volume of admixture between 
the two circulations must be equal in each direction.

septostomy I enlargement. Surgical correction
may be possible.
13 Patent Ductus 
Arteriosus (PDA) 
The ductus arteriosus is the vessel leading from the 
bifurcation of the pulmonary artery to the aorta 
distal to the left subcavian artery. It is open normally 
in the fetus but closes functionally in I -2 days after 
birth. It closes anatomically in 10 -21 days. In PDA 
there is a failure of this vessel to close, resulting in a 
continuous AV shunt.

(ASD) 
ASD is an acyanotic congenital cardiac anomaly in 
adults with a left-to-right shunt. 
Types 
1.Secundum or Fossa ovalis defect: This is
commonest and is situated in the region of fossa
ovalis.
2.Sinus venosus defect: This is crescent shaped
opening near the orifice of superior vena cava.
It is often associated with anomalous pulmonary
venous drainage.
3. Primum or partial atrioventricular canal
defect: Deficient tissue in the lower portion of
the septum.
4.Coronary sinus defects are rare and involve
posterior-interior surface of the septum.

Common 
Diagnosis 
A.Right ventricular hypertrophy -left parasternal
heave
B.Wide fixed split of second heart sound. It is wide
because due to left to right shunt at the atrial level
253 

more blood has to flow across the pulmonary 
valve. Hence P2 is delayed giving rise to a wide 
split. The split is fixed (i.e. split does not vary 
with respiration) because the shunt at the atrial 
level causes equal changes in pressure on both 
sides on inspiration. In addition, since the RV is 
fully loaded, inspiration cannot further increase 
the RV volume. 
C.Pulmonary ejection systolic murmur, which
increases on inspiration.
D.Mid-diastolic tricuspid flow murmw:
E.If there is pulmonary hypertension there will be
signs of pulmonary hypertension as described

17 > Aneurysm of Aorta 
Definition : Aneurysm of aorta is an abnormal dilata -
tion of aorta that involves all the three layers of the wall 
of the aorta. The basic d_r{ect is destruction of the elastic 
fibers in the media, which are replaced by fibrosis. 
A false aneurysm of aorta consists of an encapsulated 
hematoma in communication with the lumen of the 
aorta. 
Types 
I.Fusiform: A �egment of the aorta becomes
diffusely dilated. Abdominal aortic aneurysms
are usuall fusiform2.Saccular: A portion of the circumference is
involved and consists of outpouching with a
mouth. Thoracic aortic aneurysm is usually
saccular.
Etiology 
1.Atherosclerosis
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. Syphilis 
Connective tissue disorders: Marfan's syndrome, 
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, lupus erythematosus. 
Congenital diseases: Bicuspid aortic valve, 
Turner's syndrome, Noonan's syndrome 
Iatrogenic: Post cardiac surgery or post cardiac 
catheterization 
Predisposing factors 
Hypertension and Smoking 
Clinical Features 
I.Thoracic Aortic aneurysm
A.Symptoms:Thepatientmaybe asymptomatic
or may have any of the following symptoms.
Aneurysm of the arch of the aorta
commonly presents with symptoms.
I.Chest pain: This may occur due to
expansion or threatened rupture of
aneurysm or due to compression and
257 

258 erosion of adjacent musculoskeletal 
structures. The pain may be steady, 
boring or throbbing. 
2.Dyspnea: This may occur due to
pressure on the esophagus.
3.Cough:This occursduetopressureon
the trachea. The cough has metallic
quality and is called "Gander's cough''.
5.Dysphagia: This may occur due to
pressure on the esophagus.
6.Hoarseness of voice: This occurs due
to pressure on the recurrent laryngeal
nerve.
7.Compression myelopathy occurs
when aneurysm erodes the bones and
presses spinal cord causing spastic
paraplegia.
B.Signs: Aneurysm of ascending aorta is also
called aneurysm of signs
1.Signs due to aneurysmal sac
a.Systolic impulse over the chest
b.Systolic thrill over the area of
impulse
c.Systolic murmur over the area of
impulse
d.Parasternal dullness on the right
side
e.Loud tambour like aortic
component of second heart sound
2.Signs due to compression:
a.Superior vena cava: This causes
puffy face, dilated veins over the
chest and raised and fixed JVP.
b.Sympathetic trunk: This causes
Homer's syndrome characterized
by ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis,
enophthalmos and absent cilio
spinal reflex.
c.Right bronchus: This causes
collapse of the right lobe of lung.
3.Other signs :
a.Oliver's sign: Tracheal tug i.e.
pulsations are felt just below the
cricoid cartilagePRACTICAL MEDICINE 
b.Difference in pulse and BP in both
the extremities
II.Abdominal aortic aneurysm
A.Symptoms: Small stable aneurysms are
asymptomatic. As it enlarges there may be
deep continuous pain in the abdomen.
B. Signs:
l.Pulsating mass, free movable with
expansile pulsations . Leakage of
aneurysm may cause tenderness over 
the mass
2.Bruit may be heard
3. 
Diagnosis 
I.ThoracicFemoral pulsations may be reduced.
A.Chest X-ray and screening would show the
dilated segment with expansile pulsations
B.2D Echo: This would demonstrate the
aneurysm in suprasternal view.
C.Aortography helps of verify the presence
and extent of aneurysm.

bowel over the aneurysm.
B.Sonography and CT scan: This helps to
evaluate the size of the aneurysmal sac as
well as the thickness of its wall.
C.Aortography: This is helpful when the
diagnosis is in doubt as also to evaluate
the patency of the renal and iliac arteries.
However, it is potentially hazardous and
expensive.
Management 
I.Medical
a.Treatment of hypertensio n and to avoid
smoking and tobacco.

ily the myocardium and not the result of congenital, 
valvular, hypertension coronary, pericardial or arte­
rial diseases. 
Clinical Types

enlargement, impaired systolic function, cardiac 
failure, arrhythmias and embolization. 
2.Restrictive (R): Endomyocardial scarring or
myocardial infiltration result in right or left
ventricular filling.
3.Hypertrophic (H): Dispropor tionate left
ventricular hypertrophy involving the septum
move than the free wall.
Causes 
I.Primary
II. 1.Idiopathic (D,R,H)
2.Familial (D,H)
3.Eosinophilic endomyocardial disease (R)
4.Endomyocardial fibrosis (R)
Secondary
1.Infective (D): Viral, bacterial, fungal,

2.Metabolic (D)
3.Familial storage disease {DIR): Glycogen
storage disease, mucopolysaccharidoses.
4.Deficiency (D): Nutritional, electrolytes.
5.Connective tissue disorders (D): SLE,

8.Toxic (D): Alcohol, drugs, radiation, etc.
9.Peripartum (D)
10.Endocardial fibroelastosis (R).
Dilated (Congestive) Cardiomyopathy 
In Dilated cardiomyopathy, there is impairment of 
systolic function ofleft and right ventricular. It is the 
end result of myocardial damage produced by a variety 
of toxic, metabolic and infectious agents. 
Causes 
1.Viral myocarditis (late sequel)2.Toxic: Alcoholic
3.Pregnancy
4.Metabolic: Hypocalcemia, Hypophosphatemia
5.Selenium deficiency
6.Chronic uncontrolled tachycardia
7.Right ventricular dysplasia.
Clinical Features 
The patients may present with 
I.Cardiac failure
2.Angina
3.Systemic embolization from mural thrombus.
Investigations 
X-ray chest: There would be cardiac enlargement,
due to left ventricular enlargement. Lung fields show
pulmonary venous hypertension and interstitial or
alveolar edema.
ECG: This may show sinus tachycardia, cardiac ar­
rhythmias and non-specific ST-T changes. 
Echocardiogram: This may show LV enlargement and 
reduced ejection fraction. 
Treatment 
1.Treatment of cardiac failure with diuretics,
digoxin and ACE inhibitors.
2.Immunosuppressive agents may benefit in a
few patients who have evidence of myocardial
inflammation.
3.Anti-arrhythmic agents: Mostofthesedrugsare
avoided for fear of pro-arrhythmias. Surgical
interruption of arrhythmic circuit or implantable
defibrillator may be used.
4.Cardiomyoplasty
5.Heart-Assist devices and Artificial heart
6.Cardiac transplantation may be tried in patients
with advanced disease, refractory to medical
treatment.
Restrictive Cardiomyopathy 
This is characterized by abnormal diastolic function. 
The ventricular wall is rigid and impairs ventricular 
filling. It resembles constrictive pericarditis. 
261 

Causes 
1.Idiopathic
2.Endomyocardial fibrosis
3.Eosinophilic endomyocaraial disease
4.Amyloidosis, Hemochromatosis, Glycogen
storage disease
5.Endomyocar dial fibroelastosis
6.Neoplastic infiltration
Clinical Features 
The partial obliteration of ventricular cavity by fibrous 
tissue and thrombus leads to increased resistance to 
ventricular filling. As a result of persistently elevated 
venous pressure, these patients have the following 
features: 
1.Dependent edema, ascites and enlargement of
liver (Resembling cirrhosis of liver)
2.JVP is raised and fixed. It may rise on inspiration
(Kussmaul's sign).
3.Heart sounds are faint. Third and fourth heart
sounds may be heard.
Investigations 
X-ray chest: Normal or enlarged heart size would be
present without pulmonary congestion. Pericardia!
calcification which occurs with 
constriction pericar­
ditis never occurs.
ECG: This may show low-voltage and ST T changes. 
Various arrhythmias may occur.

Echocardiogram: This may show symmetrical ly 
thickened left ventricular wall with normal or slight 
reduced systolic function (ejection fraction). On 
Doppler examination accentuated early diastolic fill­
ing is detected. 
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy 
This is characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy 
often with asymmetrical septa! hypertrophy where up­
per part of the interventricular septum is preferentially 
hypertrophied and a dynamic left ventricular outflow 
tract pressure gradient occurs. 
Genetics 
In 50 % of patients, it is transmitted as an autosomaf 
dominant trait. It is due to an abnormality of the bela 
myosin heavy chain,caused by a single point mutation 
on chromosome 14. 
Clinical Features 
Symptoms 
I.Patients may be asymptomatic or may have
Sudden death.
2.Dyspnea occurs due to stiff left ventricle and
elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure
3.Angina pectoris
4.Syncope, fatigue or graying out spells
Signs 
1. 
2. 
3. Double or triple apex impulse 
Rapidly rising carotid arterial pulse 
Fourth heart sound 
4.Systolic murmur which is harsh, diamond
shaped, blowing and best heard at the lower
left sternal borders. It is increased by exercise,
digitalis, nitrates, sudden standing and Valsalva
manouvre. It is decreased by squatting, hand grip
and passive leg raising.
5.Pansystolic murmur at apex due to mitral
regurgitation.
Investigations 
ECG: This may show left ventricular hypertrophy with 
broad Q waves and arrhythmias. 

{ 5 ) Cardiovascular System 
X-ray chest: There may be mild to moderate left ven­
tricular enlargement.
Echocardiogram: This may demonstrate septa! hy­
pertrophy and systolic 
anterior motion of the mitral 
valve. The left ventricular cavity is small. 
Treatment 
A.Drugs
l.Beta-blockers: Beta-blockers relieve angina
and syncope in 33% patients.
2.Calcium antagonists : 
Verapamil and
Diltiazem reduce the stiffness of the
ventricles and reduce the elevated diastolic
pressures.
3.Disopyramide has been used in some
patients to reduce LV contractility and
outflow gradient.
B.Dual chamber pacemakerreduces outflow
gradient by altering the pattern of ventricular
contraction

2 > Examination 
A: Higher Functions 
I.Consciousness
II. Consciousness is a state of awareness of one's
self and one's environment.
Sleep: Sleep is a state of physical and mental
inactivity from which the patient can be aroused
to normal consciousness.
Catatonia: Catatonia is a state during which
rigid plastic postures of limbs for long hours
are assumed. The person is unresponsive, mute
and immobile. It may occur in psychosis or with
frontal lobe and hypothalamic lesions.
Akinetic mutism: Akinetic mutism is a state
during which the patient remains immobile,
making no sound, follows movements slowly
with his eyes and allows himself to be fed and
nursed. This is seen with lesions of diencephalon
and brainstem.
Drowsiness: This is a pathological state that
resembles normal sleep. Patient can be aroused
with an external stimulus, but reverts back to
his drowsy state on withdrawal of the stimulus.
Semicoma: Semicoma is a pathological state,
which requires stronger stimulation to arouse
the patient, though his reflexes are normal.
Stupor: Stupor is often considered synonymous
to semicoma, whereas some doctors regard it as
a state between drowsiness and semicoma.
Coma: This isthedeepestlevelofunconsciousness.
Patient is immobile, all the reflexes are absent
and plantar response is extensor (See Ch. 7 &
pg. 290).
Delirium
Delirium is the acute state of confusion with
excitement and hyperactivity.

( 6 > Central Nervous System 
Causes 
1.Infective: Septicemia, typhoid, cerebral
malaria
2.Withdrawal state: Alcohol
3.Toxic: Overdose of aspirin, amphetamine,
atropine, etc
4.Deficiency of thiamine and nicotinic acid
5.Metabolic: Renal failure, porphyria
Ill. Delusions 
Delusions are false beliefs, which cannot be 
corrected in spite of evidence to the contrary. 
Delusions have to be distinguished from 
superstitions, which are a part of the cultural 
traditions in certain societies. 
Causes 
I.Holistic: Delusions of disordered or
diseased body, e.g. the body is riddled with
cancer or his sex is changing. This is seen
in schizophrenia or depressive illnesses.
2.Delusions of guilt: Patient may blame
himself excessively for some trivial lapse
and expect to be imprisoned or hanged for
the same. This is seen in depressive states.
3.Delusions of grandeur: e.g. A patient who
is a beggar may say that he is the richest
man in the world, and is about to marry
the Premier's daughter. This is seen in GP!
mania and paranoid schizophrenia.
Significance: False beliefs on a background of a 
clear consciousness are of more grave significance 
than those occurring when consciousness is 
clouded. 
IV.Hallucinations
This is false perception of sensations in the
absence of any sensory stimulus e.g. humming
in the ears when there is no sound or seeing
somebody who does not exist. This has to be
distinguished from illusion, which is altered
perception to sensory stimulus, e.g. mirage in
the desert.

IX.Language and Speech
Language includes all modes of communication
between people. The various forms oflanguage
are:
1. Listening to speech which begins at about
6 months of age when the child hears some
words or phrases and begins to associate
them with appropriate objects or actions.
2.Speaking or Spoken language includes
expression of thoughts in spoken words,
phrases and sentences. It begins at about
9 months of age when the child begins to
mimic the sounds he hears and begins to
associate them with objects or meaning.
3.Writing implies ability to communicate
by the written word. In mirror writing
the letters or figures are reversed as seen
in themirror. This is a normal feature in
writings of children up to the age 6-7 years.
Its persistence in later years is pathological
and is seen in:
Frontal 
pole a)Forced right-handedness.
b)When a right-handed person with
right hemiplegia attempts to write
with his left hand.
c)Developmental dyslexia: This is a

defect in learning to read. Hence here 
mirror writing is secondary to mirror 
reading. 
4.Reading is the ability to communicate
through the written word.
5.Sign language is ability to communicate
by gestures.
6.Touch language is communication by the
written word employed by the blind in
reading.
Disorders of Language & Speech 
The disorders of language and speech occur with le­
sions of the dominant hemisphere. About 90% of the 
population have left cerebral dominance i.e. they are 
right handed and 10% have right cerebral dominance 
i.e. they are left-handed. But among left handed people
60% have left cerebral dominance.
Dysphasia/ Aphasia 
Definition: Dysphasia is difficulty with language func­
tion. It occurs due to lesions in the language areas of 
the dominant cerebral hemisphere. 
Pathways: The main language areas are shown below: 
Broca's Area (Inferior frontal region) (Area 44): This 
is concerned with generation of motor programs for 
the production of words or parts of word. Damage 
to this area causes reduced number of words, poorly 
articulated, non-fluent speech and grammatical errors. 
The speech has a tele grammatic quality. 
Table 6.2 : Aphasias Wernicke's Area (Posterior temporal lobe and adjoin­
ing parietal region) (Area 22): This is concerned with 
comprehension oflanguage and selection of words to 
convey meaning. In lesions of this area, spontaneous 
speech is normal, fluent and articulation is normal. 
However the speech may contain incorrect words ( ver­
bal paraphasias), incorrect letters (literal paraphasias) 
and nonsense words (neologisms). 
Occipitotemporal (lingual) gyrus is the visuopsychic area. 
The posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus is 
the auditory (auditopsychic) cortex. The final sensory 
pathway leads to the inferior part of the post central 
gyrus for coordination of the meaning of the informa -
tion and the organization of any response that may be 
required. If any motor response is expected, then a relay 
of information goes to the precentral gyrus ( the motor 
coordinating centre and from there, to the motor speech 
area if verbal response is expected. 
Types of Dysphasia/ Aphasia: 
Sensory (Wernicke's) dysphasia: 
Auditory: The patient is unable to carry out simple 
verbal commands in absence of loss of hearing. The 
lesion is in the posterior part of the superior temporal 
gyrus (word deafness). 
Visual: Inability to read in absence of loss of vision 
(word blindness). The lesion is in the medial occipi­
totemporal gyrus. It is associated with inability to 
write (dysgraphia). 
Nominal: Inability to name objects. The lesion is in 
the left temporoparietal region.

Motor (Broca's) dysphasia: 
The lesion is in Broca's area. The patient is unable to 
express himself. There may be difficulty in forming 
phrases and sentences. The emotional outbursts may 
be retained. 
Central Dysphasia: 
This results from a disorderofthe central organization 
of written or spoken speech. The patient is unable to 
comprehend spoken or written language and even his 
own speech. This is usually associated with motor or 
expressive defects. The lesion is in the left temporo­
parietal region (Arcuate fibers). 
Conduction Aphasia : Speech output is fluent but 
paraphasic. Repitition is impaired, naming and writing 
are also impaired. Reading aloud is impaired but com­
prehension of read material is present, comprehension 
of spoken language is intact. Lesion is in perisylvian 
area with damage to fibres of Arcuate faciculus. 
Transcortical Motor Aphasia features are similar to 
Broca's aphasia but repetition is intact. The lesion is 
anterior superior to Broaca's area. 
Transcortical Sensory Aphasia features are similar to 
Wernicke's aphasia but repetition is intact. The lesion 
is posterior inferior to Wernicke's area. 
Global Aphasia speech is nonfluent and comprehen · 
sion is severely impaired. Naming, repetition, reading 
and writing are impaired. Lesion is usually large in 
middle cerebral artery territory or left internal carotid 
artery or a large hemorrhage or major trauma. 
Isolation of Speech Area : This is a rare syndrome 
in which comprehension is severly impaired & no 
purposeful speech output. He may repeat like a parrot 
parts of heard conversation -"echolalia". It is seen in 
complete watershed zone infarctions. 
Anomic Aphasia: There is minimal dysfunction only 
naming, word finding and spelling are impaired. 
Most common language disturbance seen (Refer to 
Table 6.2). 
Dysarthria 
Definition: Dysarthria is indistinct speech due to 
weakness or impaired coordination of the orolingual 
muscles concerned with the production of consonants. 
However, the grammar is norrqal and comprehension 
of spoken and written language is retained. 
270 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
Dysarthria commonly occurs due to mechanical fac­
tors such as ill-fitting dentures. 
Types of Dysarthria: 
I.Spastic: This results from bilateral upper motor
neuron lesion. The tongue is small and spastic.
There is difficulty in pronouncing 'b' 
'p' and 't'.
2.Monotonous: This 
results from extrapyram idal
lesions. The speech is slow, monotonous and
lacking accents.
3.Ataxic: This results from cerebellar lesions. The
speech is slurred and irregular in rhythm, tone
and volume due to incoordination of muscles of
respiration, 
larynx, pharynx and lips (scanning
speech). This is called scanning speech when
speech has explosive character and shining of
consonants it is called staccats speech.
4.Lower motor neurone: This results from
paralysis of the soft palate giving rise to nasal
speech. There is failure to produce sounds like
"b" 
and "g" correctly. e.g. "Egg" is pronounced as 
"eng". In myasthenia gravis, the force and volume
of 
the words diminish as the patient speaks and
may return to normal after some rest.
X.Other Higher 
Function Disorders
A.Apraxia
Inability to carry out learned voluntary
movement in 
the presence of normal motor,
sensory and cerebellar functions
Types
I.ldeomotor Apraxia : Inability to plan or
complete motor actions. There is inability
to pretend to use a tool e.g. pretend to brush
ones hair when given a comb. The ability
to spontaneously use 
tools is retianed e.g.
brush one's hair in morning.
2.IdeationalApraxia / Conceptual Apraxia:
Inability to conceptualize 
a task or complete
a multistep task e.g. patient puts on shoes
before 
socks, if given a screwdriver, the
patient may try to write like it is a pen.
3.Limb-Kinetic Apraxia: Inability to make

A.Hypertrophy of Muscles: Some patients
of muscular dystrophy may develop large
muscles especially calves, buttocks and
infraspinati. These muscles are weak in
spite of their size. Hence they are called
pseudohypertrophy.
B.Wasting of Muscles: Wasting of muscles
may occur in several diseases as mentioned
below. The wasted muscles are flabby,
smaller and softer than normal. When there
is associated fibrosis, the muscles feel hard,
inelastic and shortened (contracture).

Tone is the resistance offered by normal muscles
to passive movements. It is greatest in thosemuscles that maintain the body in position. 
These are the antigravity muscles, principally 
the flexors in the upper limbs and extensors in 
the lower limbs. 
A.Hypotonia (Flaccidity)
Definition: It is characterized by flabby
muscles, which offer less resistance to
passive movements, leading toan increased
range of passive movements and the limb
is unable to maintain posture.
Causes 
1.Lowermotorneu ronedisease:Poliomyelitis,
peripheral neuritis, tabes dorsalis etc.
2.Neuronal shock in upper motor neurone
disease
3.Cerebellar disease
4.Rheumatic chorea
B.Hypertonia
Definition: Hypertonia is increased
resistance to passive movements, a
heightened salience of the muscles and
increased firmness on palpation.

2.Extrapyramidal disorders
3.Hysterical
4.Tetany
5.Tetanus
6.Decerebrate rigidity 
7. Strychnine poisoning
8.Stiff man syndrome
9.Continuous muscle fiber activity (ISAAC
disease)
Types 
l.Clasp knife spasticity: There is increased
tone in the flexors of the upper limbs. The
resistance is increased only at the beginning
or at the end of the passive movement. This
is seen in pyramidal lesions.
2.Lead-pipe rigidity: There is increased tone,
both in flexorsand extensors. The resistance
is present throughout the entire range of
movement. It results from the failure of
striatal regulation of tonus controlling
centres in the mid-brain and brainstem.PRACTICAL MEDICINE

3. Present during beginning 3. Present throughout the

4. Plantarsareextensors 4. Plantarsareflexors 
This is seen with extra pyramidal lesions. 
3.Cog wheel rigidity: The increased resistance
is throughout the entire range of passive
movement and is rhythmically jerky
because the static tremors which are
masked by rigidity emerge faintly during
manipulation.
4.Decerebrate rigidity: There is marked
contraction of all extensor muscles. The
limbs are stiff, extended, head is erect and
the jaw is closed. The righting reflexes
are abolished but the tonic neck and
labyrinthine reflexes are retained, and the
tendon reflexes are exaggerated.
It results from the release of the vestibular
nuclei from the higher extrapyramidal
control and may result from lesions of the
brain stem at any level between superior
colliculi and vestibular nuclei.
5.Hysterical rigidity: It is of wide distribution

and oflong duration precipitated by alarm, 
excitement or fatigue with resistance 
usually increasing with increased force or 
passive movement of the limb. 
6.Reflex rigidity: [tis characterized by muscle
spasm in response to pain e.g. board-like
rigidity of the abdomen in peritonitis; neck
rigidity in meningitis.
7.Gegenhalten phenomenon: Here there is
stiffening of a limb in response to contact
and a resistance to passive changes in
position and posture. The strength of the
antagonists increase as one increase s force
to change the position of the limb. rt can
be mistaken for Hysterical rigidity.
Causes: Encephalopathy, frontal lobe
disorders toxic (manganese , carbon
monoxide), drugs (reserpine, pheno­
thiazines) and extrapyramidal (dystonia,
athetosis and spasmodic torticollis)
8.Myotonia: There is increased muscle
tone and contraction. There is tonic
perseveration of muscular contraction
and relaxation occurs slowly. Sudden
movement may be followed by marked
spasm and inability to relax. Repetition
of movement often brings about ease
of relaxation 
and gradual decrease in
hypertonicity.
Percussion myotonia can be elicited by
mechanical stimulation: Abrupt tapping
of the thenar eminence with hammer
is followed by opposition of the thumb,
which persists for several seconds before
Fig 6.8:Acaseof 
myotonia dystroph1ca showing 
percussion myotonia of the tongue ------ -----------· relaxation begins. It can be elicited by 
tapping on the tongue, deltoid or other 
muscular masses, which produces a 
"dimple" that disappears slowly. 
Ill. Power 
The power of all the muscles should be tested at 
each joint in both the upper and lower limbs both 
against gravity and against resistance. Power in 
individual muscles is graded as follows: 
Table 6.7: MRC Grading of Power 
Grade O : No power 
Grade I : Flicker of contraction only 
Grade II : Movement with gravity eliminated 
Grade Ill : Movement against gravity 
Grade IV : Movement against gravity & some resistance 
Grade V : Normal power

( 6 ) Central Nervous System 
Pronator Drift : This is a test used to detect mild arm 
weakness. It is a subtle sign of an upper motor neuron 
lesion. The patient is asked to hold both arms fully ex­
tended in front of him with the palms facing upwards 
and hold the position. When positive, the affected 
side arm tends to drift down and pronation occurs.

2.Meniere's disease
3.Drugs: Streptomycin
D.Central: Vascular lesion in medulla affecting
vestibular nucleus
Tests 
l.Romberg's Test: The patient is asked to stand
with his feet closely approximated, first
with his eyes open and then with his eyes
dosed.
In sensory ataxia the patient is able to
maintain the upright position while 
the eyes
are open, but when the eyes are closed he
sways. This is a positive Romberg sign (Fig.
6.29).
In the vermis or mid-line cerebellar lesion,
there is difficulty in standing erect andmaintaining a steady 
position with the eyes 
either open or closed. If he falls it is generally 
backwards or forwards. 
In a unilateral cerebellar hemispheric lesion 
or in a unilateral vestibular lesion the patient 
will sway or fall towards the involved side. 
The head may be tilted towards the involved 
side with the chin rotated towards the sound 
side. 
In hysteria there may be a false Romberg's 
sign, often with marked unsteadiness, but 
281 

282 Fig 6.36·Tandem walking 
with swaying at the hips rather than the 
ankles. 
2.Tandem Walking: The patient is asked
to walk in a straight line by placing one
heel directly in front of the opposite toes,
both with eyes open and with eyes closed.
(Fig. 6.30)
In sensory ataxia the patient may walk fairly
well with eyes open, but on closing his eyes
he sways and staggers.
In vermis lesions the patient sways with
eyes open and tends to fall in any direction
especially forwards or backwards. In
unilateral cerebellar hemisphere lesion the
patient deviates towards the side oflesion.
3.Finger Nose Test: The patient is asked to
abduct and extend the arm completely and
then to touch the tip of his index finger to
the tip of his nose. The test is performedPRACTICAL MEDICINE 
slowly at first, and then rapidly, with eyes 
open and then again with eyes dosed. 
In sensory ataxia the patient may carry out 
the act without much difficulty while the 
eyes are open, but may be unable to find 
the nose when the eyes are closed. 
In cerebellar ataxia there may be intention 
tremors, dysmetria and dyssynerg ia. 
Intention tremors are characterized by 
hyperkinesis which becomes more marked, 
more coarser and more irregular as the 
finger approaches the nose. 
In dysmetria the patient may stop before he 
reaches his nose. In dyssynergia the act is 
not carried out smoothly and harmoniously 
but is decomposed into its constituent parts. 
4.Finger to Finger Test: The patient is asked to
abduct the arms to the horizontal and then
bring in the tips of the index fingers in a
wide circle to approximate them exactly in
the mid-line. In unilateral cerebellar lesion
the arm on the involved side will sag and
undershoot so that the finger on that side
will be below the one on the normal side.
r.;;;;;;;;;;;:-::-...:- -
5.For Dysdiadochokinesia: The patient is
asked to alternately pronate and supinate
his hands, open and close his fists, pat his
knees with the palms and dorsa of his hands
alternately.
In cerebellar lesion there is dysdiadocho­
kinesia i.e. one movement cannot be
immediately followed by its diametrically
opposite movement because the contraction
of the set of agonists and relaxation of the

( 6 ) Central Nervous System 
antagonists cannot be immediately followed 
by relaxation of the agonists and contraction 
of the antagonists. Hence the test is carried 
out slowly with pauses during transition 
between the opposing motions or it is done 
unsteadily, and irregularly with loss of 
rhythm. 
6.Rebound Test of Gordon Holmes: It checks
the ability to contract the antagonist
muscles immediately after relaxation of the
agonist. The patient is asked to flex his arm
at the shoulder and forearm at the elbow
and to clench his fist firmly. The examiner
pulls on the wrist against resistance and
then suddenly releases it. In the normal
individual the contraction of the triceps
checks the tendency towards tlexion. In
cerebellar disorders the patient is unable
to stop the contraction of the flexors.
7.Postural Holding In 1he Upper Limb: The
patient is asked to stand with both arms held 
at the horizontal level outstretched in front
of him, with his eyes open and then with the
eyes dosed. In unilateral cerebeUardisease the 
ipsilateral arm falls gradually and is deviated
laterally.
8.Knee-Heel Test: The patient is asked to place
the heel of one foot on the opposite kneeand then push it along the shin in a straight 
line to the great toe. Dysmetria, dyssynergia 
and intention tremors as in finger nose test 
are looked for. 
9.Pendular knee jerk -2 'h oscillations makes
it pendular.
10.Hypotonia

3.Rhythm: a.Regular b. Irregular
4.Amplitude: a. Fine b.Moderate c. Coarse
Causes 
1.Static: This is a coarse tremor that is present

283 

284 4.Hysterical: It may simulate tremors in any
of the limbs and if the affected limb is
restrained by the examiner it may move
to another part of the body.
B.Chorea : It is the disease of the caudate
nucleus which is character ized by
involuntar y movements which are quasi
purposeful, quick, brief, sudden, jerky,
irregular in time, rhythm, character and
place of occurrence which are flitting from
one part to another. These increase during
anxiety and are absent during sleep. It
occurs more commonly proximally than

Types 
1.Dopa Responsive Dystonia
2.Myoclonic dystonia
F.Myoclonus: It is a 
brief shock-like muscular
contraction, which may involve the whole
muscle or a small number of muscle
fibers. The contraction may be too slight
to cause movements or may cause violent
movements. It is decreased by voluntary
relaxation. It usually disappears during
sleep.
Lesion
1.Olivo dentate system
2.Cerebral cortex
Causes

inclusion encephalitis
2.Degenerative: Cerebral lipidosis,
subacute spongiform encephalopathy
3.Vascular4.Tumor
5.Demyelinating: Disseminated sclero�

G.Fasciculations: They are visible twitches of
hyperirritable muscle 
fibers due to chronic
degenerative disease of 
their anterior horn
cells. Once the anterior horn cells are
completely destroyed, 
the fasciculations
cease.
Fasciculations 
are irregular and inconstant.
They may be absent at rest, but they can be
brought out by mechanical stimulation,
fatigue and cold.
Causes
I.Motor neurone disease
2.Spinomuscular atrophy
3.Poliomyelitis
4.Intramedullary tumors
5.Syringomyelia
6.Syphilitic amyotrophy
7.Diabetic amyotrophy
8.Hypoglycemia
9.Hypoxia
10.Organophosphorus poisoning
H.Fibrillations: Fibrillations are contractions
limited to a single muscle fiber or a small
group of muscle fibers. Hence 
they are
demonstrated only 
on E.M. G. and clinically
they may be seen only if present on the
tongue.
I.Flexor Spasms: In a patient with slow
compression of the spinal cord due to an
intact rubro-spinal tract which maintains
the extensor tone of the lower limbs, the
attitude of the patient is extension and
the flexor withdrawal reflex is inhibited.
This is paraplegia in extension. When the
rubrospinal tracts are also affected, the
extensor tone can no longer be maintained
and the flexor withdrawal reflex cannot
be inhibited. This gives rise to a sudden
involuntary contraction of the flexors of
the lower limbs in paraplegia. This is called
flexor spasm. Once the rubro-spinal tracts
285 

are totally damaged the patient assumes a 
flexion attitude of the lower limbs due to 
flexor withdrawal reflex and is said to be 
in paraplegia in flexion. 
J.Tics and Habit Spasms: These are
involuntary stereotype movements which,
to start with, are voluntary as they serve
some purpose ( e.g. contraction of platysma
with a tight collar) but later persist even
though the stimulus that initiated the
movement 
has ceased. They relieve tension.
They can be inhibited by an effort of will, but
re-appear when the attention is diverted.
The severe form of the condition is Gilles
de la Tourette's disease which is multiple
convulsive tics.
Types
l.Motor 
tics: Simple (Clonk and
Dystonic) and complex
2.Vocal tics: Simple and complex
K.Myokymia : They are 
transient or persistent,
quivering or flickering 
movements which
affect a few muscle bundles within a single
muscle but usually are not extensive enough
to cause movement at a joint. They are not
limited to the muscle fibers and undulating
and more widespread than fasciculations.
They occur due to irregular discharge
spreading to and through various muscle
bundles. There is no associated musclePRACTICAL MEDICINE 
weakness and wasting. They are also called 
false fibrillations. 
Causes 
1.Physiological: Unaccustomed
exercise, cold or when going to sleep
2.Anemia and debilitating conditions
L.Titubation : Involuntary nodding of head
seen in lesions of vermis of cerebellum and
old age.
D: Sensory System 
Sensation can be divided into : 
A.Superficial : Pain / temperature / superficia l
touch, carried by spinothalamic pathway.
B.Deep : Crude touch, joint position, vibration
carried by dorsal, coloumn pathway.
C.Cortical : Can be tested only when other
sensations are intact.
1.Touch: This is tested with cotton wool or the
head of the pin on all the parts of the body (Fig.
6.42A).
2.Pain: Superficial pain is tested with a pin prick
on all the parts of the body and any area where
it is not felt adequately is noted. Deep pain is
tested by pressing the calves, tendo Achillis or
testes. It is lost in tabes dorsalis, whereas calves
are tender in peripheral 
neuritis (Fig. 6.42B).
3.Temperature: Two test tubes, one containing

placed on all the parts of the body. The patient 
is asked to denote if he feels the temperatu re. 
Position: The patient is explained the procedure. 
With his eyes closed, a part of his limb / arm is 
placed in a definite position and then he is asked 
to denote the position or place the other limb in 
a similar position. 
Joint Sense : Patients eyes remain closed. After 
fixing the joint, the finger / toe is moved at terminal interphalangeal joint, either up or down 
by holding the sides of digits. Pulp of finger is 
not touched. Patient is asked to tell the direction 
i.e. either up or down (Figs_ 6.42 D and E).
6.Vibrations: A tuning fork of 128 vibrations per
second is vibrated and placed on some bony
prominence of the patient. The patient is asked
to indicate if he feels the vibrations (see figure
6.42C)_
7.Cortical sense: Tactile localization, tactile
discrimination, tactile extinction and
stereognosis 2 point discrimination and
graphasthesia (see figure 6.42 F and G).
Sensory changes in various diseases are as below: 
1.Polyneuropathy: Symmetri cal glove and
stocking anesthesia ( affecting distal parts more)
involving all the modalities of sensations. There
is calf tenderness (Fig. 6.44)_
2.Cauda Equina and Conus Lesion: Loss of all
modalities of sensations involving especially
lower sacral segments leading to perianal
anesthesia (also 
Refer Pg. 336) (Fig. 6.45).
3_ Multiple Roots Involvement: There are
varying degrees of impairment of cutaneous
sensations in the distribution of the nerve
roots. Pain sensation is more affected than
touch.
4.Complete 
Section of Spinal Cord: All forms of
sensations are abolished below a particular level,
with a narrow zone ofhyperesthesia at the upper
margin of the anesthetic zone. In some patients
with high cord compression sacral fibers may be
spared resulting in sacral sparing ( Figs-6.46 and
6.47).
5.Hemi-section of Spinal Cord: Pain and
temperature is lost a few segments below a
particular level on the opposite side whilst
vibration, position and joint 
senses are affected
on the same side (Fig_ 6.48).
6.Syringomyelia: Loss of pain temperature
sensation (fibers of which cross the cord in the
anterior commissure). Touch, vibration, joint
and position senses are normaL This is also called
dissociate anesthesia (Fig. 6.49).

8.Posterior Spinal Syndrome: Loss of position,
joint and vibration sense below a level with
normal touch, temperature and pain senses, e.g.
Tabes dorsalis (Fig. 6.50).
9.Brain Stem Syndrome: Loss of touch, pain
and temperature on same side of the face and
opposite 
side of the body due to involvement
of trigeminal tract or nucleus and lateral
spinothalamic tracts 
(Fig. 6.51 ).
10.Thalamic Syndrome: Loss of all modalities of
sensations on the opposite side of the body.
Position sense is more affected than any other
sensation. There may be spontaneous pain and
discomfort ( thalam ic pain) of the most torturing
and disabling type (Fig. 6.52).
11.Parietal Lobe Syndrome: There is loss of
discriminative sensory function:
A.Loss of tactile localization: Patient is unable
to localize the site touched.
B.Loss of tactile discrimination: When two
stimuli are applied together, one near the
other, the patient appreciates both as one
stimulus.
C.Tactile extinction: When two stimuli are
applied simultaneously to two symmetrical
portions of the body, the patient neglects
the one on the opposite side of the lesion,
though individually he appreciates the
stimulus on both sides.
D.Astereognosis: Patient is unable to appreciate
objects (like coins, keys etc.) by touch alone.
E.Primary modalities of sensations may be
affected in deep-seated parietal lobe lesions.
F.Two 
Point discrimination (Figs. 6.42 F and
G): This is 
performed with a divider. The
patient is asked to distinguish the contact
of 2 separate points of the divider when
applied simultaneously. The distance at
which the patient is unable to distinguish
the two points as separate is measured. The
minimum distance is different in different
parts of the body which is normally:Finger pulp, lips : 
3 -5 mm 
Palm: 2 -3 mm 
Sole :4 cm 
Dorsum of foot : 5 cm 
Back: 5 ems. 
12.Hysterical:
A.Complete hemianesthesia with reduced
hearing, vision, taste and smell as well as
reduced vibration onlyoverone half of the
skull.
B.Sharply defined sensory loss not confined
to the distribution of the root or cutaneous
nerve.
C.Postural sense is rarely affected.
E: Reflexes 
I.Superficial Reflexes
The superficial reflexes have, in addition to 
a spinal reflex arc, a superimposed cortical 
pathway, a "cerebral arc». Impulses ascend 
through the spinal cord and brain stem to the 
parietal 
areas of the brain and have connections 
with the motor centres in the pyramidal or the 
premotor areas. Efferent impulses then descend 
in the pyramidal tracts. Hence a lesion of the 
reflex arc or a lesion at a high level anywhere 
along the pyramidal pathway abolishes the 
superficial reflexes.

There is believed to be a centre in the region

reflexes, and a lesion of this centre leads to brisk 
superficial reflexes. It is seen in:

Hoffmann's Sign 
Method: The patient's hand is pronated and 
the observer grasps the terminal phalanx of the 
middle finger between his forearm and thumb. 
With a sharp flick, the phalanx is passively flexed 
and suddenly released. A positive response 
consists of a sharp twitch with adduction and 
flexion of the thumb and flexion of the fingers. 
Significance: It is an index of muscular 
hypertonia rather than of pyramidal lesion as 
such. It is not always positive in presence of a 
pyramidal lesion. It may beelicitable in a nervous 
individual with no organic disease. Ifit is present 
on one side only, it is likely to be significant. 
H. Wartenburg's sign :
291 

The patient's hand is supinated. Examiner 
pronates his hand and interlocks his fingers with 
the patients. The patient pulls his fingers away 
against the examiners resistance. Normally, the 
thumb extends. In pyramidal tract lesions the 
thumb adducts and flexes. This indicates early 
stage of pyramidal tract disease ( this is equivalent 
to Babinski reflex in the lower limb}. 
II.Deep Tendon Reflexes
Physiology: The tendon reflex is the reflex
contraction of muscle or part of a muscle in
response to stretch. Hence the sudden stretch,
brought about by tapping the tendon evokes a
sharp muscular contraction.
Reinforcement of the tendon jerks may be
achieved by clenching the fists or by pulling the
flexed fingers of the two hands against each other
(Jendrassiks maneuver), as these movements
increase the activity of the gamma efferent
system.

Variations of deep tendon reflexes 
l.Paradoxic triceps reflex: This consists of 
flexion instead of extension of the forearm
following stimulation of the triceps tendon.
This response appears when the arc of the
triceps reflex is damaged e.g. in lesions of
seventh and eighth cervical segments; insuch cases the stimulus calls forth a flexor 
response unopposed by the triceps muscle. 
2.Inversion of the radial reflex: In pyramidal
lesions at the fifth and sixth cervical
segments there may be contraction of the
flexors of the hand and fingers without
flexion and supination of the forearm. This
is called inversion of the radial reflex.
This occurs because there is exaggeration
of reflexes sub served by segments below
the fifth and sixth cervical segments. A tap
on the styloid process stimulates both the
contraction of the brachioradialis ( which
is served by CS-6 and hence abolished) and
long flexors of the fingers (served by C7-8
and hence brisk).
3.Clonus: Clonus is a rhythmical series of
contractions in response to the maintenance
of tension in a muscle, associated with
increased gamma efferent discharge. It is
elicitable when tendon reflexes are brisk
after a corticospinal lesion.
Patellar cl onus ( of quadriceps) is best elicited
by a sudden sharp downward displacement
of the patella. It is present in pyramidal
lesions above L-2. Ankle clonus is obtained
293 

294 by sharply dorsiflexing the ankle. It is 
present in pyramidal lesions above S-1.

B.Grasp

and index finger will cause grasping of
finger. Stroking the back of the hand may
release the grasp.
C.Pa/momenta/ Reflex: Stroking the palm will
cause 
ipsilateral contraction of the chin
(mentalis).
D.Glabel/ar Tap
: Repeated tapping of patient's
glabella with the index finger produces
2-3 blinks maximally in a normal person.
It is said to be positive (abnormal) when

response is continuous. Seen 
in Parkinsons disease and degenerative 
diseases of the brain e.g. Alzheimer's 
dementia. 
These are not normally present in adults but may 
be seen in Frontal Loss disorders. 
F.Urinary Bladder
Anatomy
The bladder consists of both smooth muscles
(the detrusor and the internal sphincter) and
striated muscles (the external sphincter). The
detrusor and the internal sphincter receive
nerve supply from sympathetic (L 2,3 and 4)
and parasympathetic (S, 2, 3 and 4) nerves. Both
nerves have afferent and efferent fibers.
The parasympathetic afferent fibers which sub
serve pain 
and stretch sensation from the bladder
pass up the spinal cord in the spinothalamic tract,
lying on its outer aspects. The parasympathetic
efferent fibers contract the detrusor and relax the
internal sphincter, thus stimulate emptying of the
bladder. The sympathetic efferent fibers on the
other hand relax the detrusor and contract the
sphincter, thus inhibit emptying of the bladder.
The external sphincter is supplied by the
pudenda! nerve (S2-3). Its afferent fibers
carry touch and pressure sensations from
the urethra to the posterior column of the
spinal cord, whilst its 
efferent fibers (which
are from the anterior horn 
cells) are under
the voluntary 
control so that it is possible to
inhibit spontaneous emptying of the bladder.
The supranudear fibers of the efferent nerves
lie close 
to the pyramidal tract. The paracentral
lobule is the cortical centre for the control of
voluntary activity of the bladder.
Physiology
The rise of intravesical pressure to about
25 ems of water sets off afferent impulses
from the bladder wall stretch receptors. At
the cortex they are recorded as "desire to
micturate." If the circumstances are favorable,
para-sympathetic efferents and pudenda!

·6 . Central Nervous System
nerves are stimulated. Voluntary relaxation 
of the external sphincter and the perinea! 
muscles initiate the act of micturition whereas 
contraction of the detrusor muscle and 
relaxation of 
the internal sphincter empty the 
bladder. If the circumstances are not favorable 
the sympathetic fibers are stimulated and 
parasympathetic inhibited which contracts 
the internal sphincter and relaxes the detrusor 
muscle. This increases the volume of the 
bladder and thus intravesical pressure falls 
and the urge to micturate disappears. 
When more urine accumulates again, the 
i ntravesical pressure rises and the same sequence 
of events recur until the bladder can no longer 
expand to reduce the intravesical pressure and 
the urge remains till the patient passes urine. 
Neurogenic Bladder vs Non 
Neurological Bladder 
In elderly patients commonly due to Benign 
Prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), they face urinary 
symptoms. When predominant symptoms are 
urgency, hesitancy, poor stream / interrupted 
stream, post void dribbing, they arise from BPH 
(non-neurogenic bladder). 
When Predominant symptoms are urgency, 
frequency, precipitancy, and episodes of 
involuntary passage of urine with a normal 
stream they indicate underlying neurolgical 
cause (neurogene bladder). 
Neurogenic Bladder

bladders

5. Type Lesion 
Uninhibited bladder .. Cortico regulatory tract 
Reflex bladder .. Spinal cord above S2 
Autonomous bladder .. At S2, S3 and S4 level 
Motor atonic bladder .. Motor efferents 
Sensory atonic bladder .. Sensory afferents 
A.Uninhibited Bladder
This 
occurs in cerebrovascular accidents,
head 
injuries, brain tumors, etc. Here,
since the lesion is in the cortico-regulatorytract, voluntary control of micturition 
is lost. Hence, when the circumstances 
are favorable and the patient wants to 
initiate micturition, he is not able to 
do so immediately. After sometime the 
micturition reflex arc is stimulated and the 
patient voids urine. This is called hesitancy. 
Again when the circumstances are 
not 
favorable, and the urge to mic turate occurs, 
patient is unable to hold back the urine 
(because the voluntary cortical inhibitory 
control is lost) and patient may soil his 
clothes. This is precipitancy. 
The treatment for precipitancy is to use a 
condom catheter and attach a bag to it. 
Diagnosis: A positive diagnosis is made 
by cystometry only. It shows voiding 
contractions. To differentiate uninhibited 
bladder from chronically inflamed bladder 
I 00 mg Banthine is given I. V. and 
cystometry repeated. In uninhibited 
bladder, the voiding contractions disappear 
as they are mediated via cholinergic fibers. 
In chronically inflamed bladder they persist 
as non-cholinergic fibers mediate it. 
B.Reflex Bladder
Etiology
l.Transverse myelitis
2.Trauma
3.Neoplasms
4.Meningitis
5.Disseminated sclerosis
Pathogenesis 
Acute transection of the 
cord causes 
retention of urine during the stage of 
spinal shock. If the urethral sphincter is 
unable to maintain the pressure of the 
urine in the bladder, it gives way and urine 
dribbles out causing retention of urine 
with overflow. Once a certain amount of 
urine has been passed, pressure within the 
bladder falls and the urethral sphincter 
tone prevents further evacuation of 
bladder. This leads to retention of residual 
urine. When more urine accumulates and 
295 

296 pressure builds up in the bladder, the 
urethral sphincter gives way and once 
again urine dribbles out. 
When the stage of spinal shock passes, as 
a result of unopposed descending spinal 
impulses, reflex bladder activity begins 
since the local reflex arc is intact. The 
bladder can be stimulated by cutaneous 
stimuli or pressure over the hypogastrium 
and a complete evacuation of bladder 
occurs. This is called automatic bladder. 
This facilitated activity may involve the 
rectum causing mass evacuation ofbladder 
and rectum. 
Slowly developing and partial lesions of 
the cord do not cause spinal shock so that 
the initial retention with overflow does 
not occur. These lesions cause automatic 
bladder activity with precipitancy of 
micturition. 
Diagnosis: Clinical examination will reveal 
spinal cord lesion and cystometry will show 
sudden and uncontrollable voiding. 
Treatment: 
l. Catheterization of the bladder must
be done when there is retention of
urine to prevent the bladder muscles
from being over stretched. Again
compression of the bladder wall by
urine leads to ischemic necrosis of
the bladder as the blood supply of the
bladder lies within the bladder wall.
2.Urinaryantibiotics: Urine examination
for pus cells and RBCs and urine
culture must be done. Usually urinary
infection is a rule oncecatheterization
is done and suitable antibiotics must
be given.
3.Aluminium hydroxide: This is
given once a catheter is put in the
bladder to prevent the formation
of phosphatic stones. Aluminium
hydroxide prevents the intestinal
phosphate absorption by combining
with it and forming aluminium
phosphate.PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
4.Bladder washes: In any patient with an
indwelling catheter, bladder washes
with antiseptic solutions like Candy's
lotion must be given twice a day.
5.Bladder exercise: Once the stage of 
spinal shock has passed, the bladder
muscles must be stretched, else they
will atrophy and lead to a small
capacity bladder. This is prevented
by bladder exercises. The catheter is 
clamped for a few hours every day
which is gradually increased so that
urine accu mutates in the bladder and
stretches it. It can be evacuated by
releasing the clamp once the sensation
of fullness occurs or after a few hours.
Once automatic bladder develops and
the patient is well trained, catheter
may be removed.
C.Autonomous Bladder
Etiology
l. Congenital: Spina bifida,
meningomyelocele
2.Trauma: Gunshot, auto accidents
3.Infective: Arachnoiditis, radiculitis
4.Neoplasms of the cord
S.Surgery: Combined perinea! and
abdominal resection
Clinical Features 
l.Loss of bladder sensation
2.Inability to initiate micturition
normally. Patient learns to void urine
by applying external force to the
bladder.
3.Stress incontinence may occur if
there is paralysis of periurethral
striated muscles, which can no longer
compress and elongate the urinary
sphincter when the intravesical
pressure is markedly elevated.
4.This is usually associated with
saddle shaped anesthesia and absent
bulbocavernous reflex.

D.Sensory Paralytic Bladder
Etiology
1.Tabes dorsalis
2.Pernicious anemia
3.Diabetes
4.Disseminated sclerosis
5.Syringomyelia
Pathogenesis: There is loss of bladder
sensation, 
which leads to overdistension of
bladder. Initially there is normal capacity
and complete emptying. Gradually the
bladder capacity increases and residual
urine appears.
Clinical Features: Initially these patients
are asymptomatic. Gradually there is
terminal dribbling, and later, overflow
incontinence.
Treatment: The patient must be advised
to void frequently even ifhe does not get
bladder sensation.
E.Motor Paralytic Bladder
Etiology
1.Poliomyelitis
2.Polyradiculopathy
3.Congenital anomalies
4. Tumor
5.Trauma
Pathogenesis: Since the sensory nerves are
intact, bladder if left alone, distends and
decompensates.
Clinical features
1.Painful distension of the bladder and
inability to initiate micturition.2.Decrease in size and force of stream
and interrupted stream.
3.Recurrent episodes of urinary
infections.
Diagnosis: Cystometry -Normal 
sensations. No involuntary contractions 
of detrusor. Urecholine sensitivity test is 
positive. 
Treatment 
1.Urethral drainage
2.Parasympathomimetic agents

In meningitis it is restricted due to spasm of the
hamstrings. (Fig. 6.48)

also flexes. It is present in meningitis.
C.Symphysissign: Pressureon symphysispubis
is followed by flexion of both lower limbs.
D.Cheek Sign: Pressure against the cheeks

IV.Bikele's Sign: The patient is seated with arms
elevated extended and externally rotated and
forearm flexed. The examiner attempts passive
extension of forearm at the elbow. Resistance
to extension occurs in brachia! neuralgia and
meningitis.
Straight Leg Raising Test (SLR) 
With the patient supine and both legs extended, one leg 
is passively flexed at the hip keeping the knee extended. 
Normally it can be lifted up to 90". It is restricted in 
meningitis and sciatica. 
Lasegue's Sign: 
Once the leg is raised at a particularlevel for theS.L.R. 
test and the patient gets pain at that level, the foot is 
dorsiflexed. If the pain worsens, it is due to Sciatica. 
3 Cranial Nerves 
Can be divided into: 
A.Pure Motor: III, IV, VI, XI, XII
B.Pure Sensory: I, II, VIII
C.Mixed : V, VII, IX, X
298 First (Olfactory) Nerve 
Anatomy: The olfactory receptors in the nasal septum 
and lateral wall of the nasalcavitygive central processes 
that form bundles, the filaments of the olfactory nerve 
which penetrates the cribriform plate of the ethmoid 
bone and enters the olfactory bulb and then to the 
olfactory tract in the sulcus on the orbital surface of 
the frontal lobe. Some of the fibers of the olfactory 
tract decussate with those from the opposite side and 
then they enter the piriform lobe of the temporal lobe 
(primary olfactory cortex) and then terminate in the 
amygdaloid nucleus, septal nuclei and hypothalamus. 
Testing: The sense of smell is tested by asking the 
patient to sniff various non-irritating substances (like 
tea, coffee, dove oil, peppermint oil etc.) separately in 
each nostril and identify the odor. Irritating substances 
like ammonia are avoided because they stimulate, in 
addition, the trigeminal nerve. Each nostril is to be 
tested separately.

Parosmia and Cacosmia 
Parosmia is perversion of smell and cacosmia is 
unplesant odors. These are rare phenomena and seen 
following head-injury or with psychiatric illness like 
depression. Cacosmia is seen in atrophic 
rhinitis. 
Second (Optic) Nerve 
Anatomy: The fibers of the optic nerve, from the 
retina, pass backwards to the optic chiasma, where 
the inner half decussate, whereas the outer halfremain 
on the same side, forming on optic tract. Each optic 
tract passes backwards to the superior colliculus, from 
where part of the fibers goes to the lateral geniculate 
body, optic radiation and finally the occipital cortex 
around the calcarine sukus (visual centre). 
Test: The optic nerve can be tested by testing the visual 
acuity, visual fields and color vision. 
1.Visual 
Acuity: The visual acuity is examined at
bedside with finger counting at a 
distance of l
meter. Detailed testing requires equipment not
available at the bedside and cooperation of the
patient, 
which is often lacking in patients with
brain disorders.
Visual acuity for distant vision can be measured
by Snellen's test types which are a series ofletters
of varying sizes so constructed that the top letter
is visible to the normal eye at 60 meters and
the subsequent lines at 36, 24, 18, 12, 9, 6 and 5
meters respectively. Visual acuity is expressed
as d/D. (d. distance at which the letters are
read -6 metres and D. -distance at which the
letters should be read). Each eye should be tested
separately. The patient reads down the chart as
far as he can. If only 
the top letter of the chart
is visible, the visual acuity is 6/60. A normal eye
should be able to read up to seventh line i.e. the
visual acuity is 6/6.2. Visual acuity for near vision is tested by Jaeger's 
chart. The test types are of varying sizes. The 
near vision is recorded as the smallest type that 
the patient can read comfortably. 
Significance: Visual acuity 
is most often impaired 
by changes in the shape of the globe and in the 
refractory characteristics of the transparent 
media of the eye. Once refractory errors are 
excluded, changes in visual acuity are secondary 
to lesions in the macular region or its projection. 
All compressive and most of the non-compressive 
lesions of the optic nerve reduce visual acuity 
even before a field defect can be detected. 
Visual acuity is unimpaired in unilateral lesion 
dorsal to the optic chiasma. 
Visual Field 
To test the field of vision by confrontation method, 
the examiner must sit opposite the patient at a 
distance of2 feet. To test the right eye, the left eye 
of the patient is closed. He is asked to look fixedly 
at the left eye of the examiner, which should be at 
the same level as that of the patient. The examiner 
holds a pencil between the patient's face and his 
own and keeps it moving from outside towards 
the patient's eye in all the four directions. The 
patient is asked to indicate as soon as the pencil 
is visible in a particular direction. It is presumed 
that the examiner's field of vision is normal. 
Hence if the patient sees the pencil at the same 
time as the examiner, his field of vision in that 
direction in that eye is normal. If the examiner 
sees the pencil before the patient, the patient is 
likely to have restriction of field of vision in that 
direction. When any abnormality is suspected 
in the field of vision, accurate charts should be 
prepared by perimetry.

300 Field Defects 
I.Concentric diminution: Vision is restricted
all round its periphery. It occurs in:
l.Hysteria
2.Papilledema
3.Lesions of the anterior part of the
cortical visual centres
4.Retinal lesions
II.Central scotoma: Vision is lost in the centre
of the visual field. It occurs in:
I.Optic or retrobulbar neuritis
2.Pressure on the optic nerves
3.Lesions of the posterior part of the
cortical visual centres
4.Choroidal macular lesion
III.Hemiano pia: Vision is lost in one half of
the visual field. It occurs as follows:
A.Homonymm1s: B!indnessoccursinone
half of both sides of the eyes due to
lesions of the optic tracts or radiations
on the opposite side.
B.Quadmntic: Blindness occurs in a

occurs in partial lesions of the optic

It occurs due to lesions of the nasal
halves of both the optic nerves as is
commonly seen in pituitary tumors.
D.Bi nasal: Blindness occurs in the nasal
halves of both the fields. It can only be
produced by bilateral lesions confined
to the uncrossed optic fibers on either
side. Hence it is rare.

3.Color Vision
Color vision is best tested by pseudoisochromatic
plates oflshihara. The plates are so constructed
that a person with normal color vision will be able
to read a number which a person with defective
color vision will not.
Significance: Color vision loss usually parallels
visual acuity loss, but in optic neuritis, color
vision is much worse. Again, patients with
bilateral lesions of the inferomedial occipital
region often has color blindness with normal
visual acuity.
The most common defect of color vision is
red-green deficiency, inherited as a sex-linked
recessive condition. Defect in color vision is not
disabling, but is important in certain occupations
like flying, driving etc.

Pupils 
The pupillary size is controlled by: 
1.Constrictor fibers innervated by parasympathetic
nervous system
2.Dilator fibers controlled by sympathetic nervous
system
Since pupillary changes do not affect vision, majority 
of pupillary abnormalities are asymptomatic. 
Parasympathetic Pathways 
Light falling on the retina is conveyed via optic nerve, 
optic chiasma and then through both optic tracks to 
both lateral geniculate bodies. Fibers subserving light 
reflex are relayed via peri aqueduct to both Edinger­
Westphal nuclei. Hence, light falling on either eye, 
constricts both pupils (basis of consensual light reflex) 
302 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
When both medial rectus muscles are activated 
to converge the eyes, Edinger-Westphal nuclei are 
activated and constrict the pupils (basis of accom­
modation reflex). 
The final relay of the pathway is in the ciliary ganglion 
in the posterior orbit from where it reaches the con­
strictor muscle of the pupil. This completes the light 
reflex pathway.

3. In a completely blind eye there is no direct light 
reaction, but the resting pupil size is the same 
in both the eyes. If both eyes are blind, both 
pupils will be dilated and fixed to light if the 
cause is anterior to the lateral geniculate bodies. 
If bilateral blindness is due to occipital cortex 
lesion, the light reflex pathway will be intact and 
light reflex is preserved in both eyes. 
Marcus Gunn Pupil: When the normal 
eye is stimulated by bright light, there is no 
abnormality. When the affected eye is stimulated, 
the reaction is slower, less complete and so brief 
that the pupil may start to dilate again (pupillary 
escape phenomenon). It is best seen if the light 
is rapidly alternated from one eye to the other. 
This reaction is due to the reduction in the 
number of fibers subserving the light reflex on 
the affected side. 
Parinaud Syndrome: Here pupils are dilated 4. 
5. and fixed to light with loss of upward gaze. 
Convergence retraction nystagmus is seen. 
"Setting -sun" sign is seen. The lesion is either 
compressing or infiltrating the tectum-the area of 
superior collicular bodies in the periaqueductal 
area. 
Bippus 
Definition: Hippus is alternate rhythmic 
dilatation and constriction of pupils. 
Mechanism: Hippus has been said to be associated 
with respiratory rhythm; but is probably an 
evidence of imbalance of sympathetic and 
parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic 
nervous system.

inhibition of the sympathetic activity and not

Light Reflex 
Afferent: Optic nerve 
Efferent: Oculomotor nerve 
Method: The patient should be asked to look at a distant 
object in order to eliminate contraction of the pupils 
on accommodation. The eye not being tested must be 
covered in order to eliminate consensual reaction. A 
direct source of bright light is focussed directly into

the eye. Normally there is constriction of both pupils. 
The response of the pupil of the eye upon which the 
light falls is direct light reflex and that of the opposite 
pupil is the consensual light reflex, which occurs due 
to decussation of fibers both in the optic chiasma and 
Edinger-Westphal nucleus. 
Significance: 
In lesions of the second nerve, direct light reflex on 
same side and consensual light reflex on the opposite 
side is absent due to lesion in the afferent pathway. 
In lesions of the third nerve, direct light reflex is absent 
on affected side but consensual light reflex is present. 
Accommodation Reflex 
Afferent: 
1.Optic nerve
2.Proprioc eptive fibers from extraocular
muscles
Centre: Nucleus of Perlia 
Efferent: Oculomotor nerve 
Method: The patient is asked to look at a distant object 
and then at the examiner's finger which is gradually 
brought within 5 ems of the eyes. When the gaze is 
directed from a distant to a near object, contraction 
of the medial recti brings about a convergence of the 
ocular axes and along with this, accommodation oc­
curs by contraction of the ciliary muscles and pupils 
constrict as a part of associated movement. 
Significance: Accommodation reflex is lost in: 
1.Diphtheria
2.Encephalitis
3.Reverse Argyll Robertson's pupils
4.Parkinsonism
5.Diabetes mellitus
Ciliospinal Reflex 
Afferent: Cervical nerves 
Efferent: Cervical portion of spinal cord 
Method: A painful stimulus is applied on the neck 
and in a dim light pupils are noted. Normally there is 
mild dilatation of pupils. 
Significance: This reflex is lost in lesions of the cervical 
sympathetic fibers. Ptosis 
Causes 
A.Muscle diseases:
1.Ocular myopathy
2.Myasthenia gravis
3.Myotonia dystrophica
B.Third nerve palsy
C.Sympathetic paralysis (Homer's syndrome)
D.Pseudoptosis due to eyelid tumors
Diagnosis 
A.The patient should be asked to close the
eyes (orbicularis oculi supplied by seventh
nerve). If he is unable to do so, it is due to a
muscle disease which would affect the muscles
supplied by the third and seventh nerves.
B.If the pupils are dilated it is third nerve palsy. If
they are constricted, it is Homer's syndrome.
C. In third nerve palsy, there will be ocular muscle
palsies. In Homer's syndrome, there will be
anhydrosis and enophthalmos.

Sympathetic Pathways 
There are 3 neurons on the sympathetic pathways: 
1.From hypothalamus to lateral grey mater in the
thoracic spinal cord.
2.From spinal cord to the superior cervical ganglia.
305 

3.From superior cervical ganglia to the pupils and
blood vessels of the eye.
a)Fibers carried in the third nerve innervate
the levator muscle of the eyelid.
b)Fibers in the nasociliary nerve traverse the
ciliary ganglion without synapse to supply
the blood vessels.
c)Other fibers branch from the nasociliary
nerve as the long ciliary nerves to innervate
the pupils by passing around the eyes.
Definition: Homer's syndrome occurs due to paralysis 
of the sympathetic fibers which results in ptosis, mio­
sis, anhydrosis, enophthalmos and absent ciliospinal 
reflexes. 
Causes 
I.Hemisphere lesion.
II.Brain-stem lesion: Since the sympathetic
pathways in the brain stem lie adjacent to the
spinothalamic tract. Homer's syndrome will be
associated with loss of pain and temperature on
the opposite side of the body.
Causes
A.Vasculitis
B.Encephalitis
C.Multiple sclerosis
D.Pontine glioma
III.Cervical cord lesion: Since the sympathetic
fibers are centrally situated there will be usually
bilateral Homer's syndrome with dissociate
anesthesia and loss of deep reflexes in the arms.

4. Central lesion affects sweating over the entire 
head, neck, arm and upper trunk on the same 
side. 
Lesions in the lower neck affect sweating over 
the entire face. 
Lesions above superior cervical ganglion may 
not affect sweating at all as the main outflow to 
the facial blood vessels and sweat glands is below 
the superior cervical ganglion. 
The presence of three neurons in the pathway 
leads to some useful pharmacological tests 
based on denervation hypersensitivity. Decrease 
in amine-oxidase due to lesion at or beyond 
superior cervical ganglion sensitizes the pupils 
to adrenaline 1: 1000, which has no effect on the 
normal pupils. Conversely the effect of cocaine 
on the pupil depends on its blocking effects on 
the amine oxidase. Therefore cocaine has no 
effect on distally denervated pupil. It will only 
dilate the pupil in the Homer's syndrome if the 
lesion is below the superior cervical ganglion 
and there is amine oxidase at the nerve endings 
for it to block.

Third, Fourth and Sixth Nerves 
The third, fourth and sixth cranial nerves are respon­
sible for movements of the eyeball and hence if they 
are affected singly or together they cause defective 
ocular movements. 
Anatomy of Ill, IV and VI Nerves 
THIRD NERVE: The third nerve arises from the mid­
brain. The fibers from vario·us nuclei course anteriorly, 
307 

traversing the red-nucleus, substantia nigra and the 
cerebral peduncle and exit from the anterior surface 
of midbrain. Various filaments of the third nerve 
unite to form the third nerve on each side. The third 
nerve emerges just above the pons and between the 
superior cerebellar and posterior cerebral arteries. It 
penetrates the dura anterior to the posterior clinoid 
processes and enters the cavernous sinus. It enters 
the orbit through the superior orbital fissure where 
it separates into superior and inferior divisions. The 
former supplies the superior rectus and levator pal­
pebrae superioris, while the latter supplies the medial 
and inferior recti and the inferior oblique muscles and 
sends a short root to the ciliary ganglion from which 
postganglionic fibers go as the short ciliary nerves to 
supply the ciliary muscles and the sphincter pupillae. 
The third nerve may also send some fibers to the 
orbicularis oculi and as a result some weakness of 
this muscle may be present in the third nerve lesions. 
A third nerve paralysis need not always be complete. If 
the lesion is in the midbrain where the nuclear centres 
are still separated, or within the orbit after the nerve 
has redivided, only certain portions or functions may 
be involved. However, if the lesion is along the course 
of the nerve between its emergence from the mid brain 
and its division within the orbit, there is apt to be 
paralysis of all functions. 
FOURTH NERVE: The nucleus of the fourth nerve 
lies in the midbrain just caudal to the lateral nucleus 
of the third nerve. The fibers curve posteriorly and 
caudally around the aqueduct and decussate in the 
anterior medullary velum. It is the only cranial nerve 
whose fibers emerge posteriorly. It encircles around 
the pons and cerebral peduncle. It penetrates the dura 
behind and lateral to posterior clinoid process, enters 
the cavernous sinus where it is lateral and inferior to the 
third nerve and enters the orbit through the superior 
orbital fissure. It terminates on the superior oblique 
muscle on the side opposite to the nucleus of origin. 
The Sixth Nerve: It arises in the pons posterior to the 
nucleus of the facial nerve and cro,sses the internal 
auditory artery. It has a long intracranial course. It 
passes between the pons and clivus and pierces the 
dura at dorsum sellae where it lies close to the gas­
serian ganglion. It enters the cavernous sinus where it 
lies below and medial to the third nerve. It enters the

orbit through the superior orbital fissure and supplies
the lateral rectus muscle.
Cortical Control 
The symmetrical and synchronous movements of the 
two eyes responsible for accurate binocular vision is 
called conjugate movement or gaze. It is controlled by 
centres in cerebral cortex and brainstem. 
Area 8 in the frontal lobe is responsible for voluntary 
conjugate movements on command. These are rapid 
and jerky which are elicited reflexly when a sudden

sound causes the eyes to move in the direction of

on the fovea. Ultimately all the pathways mediating 
rapid, pursuit and vestibulo-ocular movements con­
verge via the pyramidal tract to the pontine centres 
for horizontal gaze. The pontine centre accomplishes 
conjugate lateral gaze by simultaneous innervation 
of the ipsilateral external rectus and contralateral in­
ternal rectus. The latter two are connected by medial 
longitudinal fasciculus.

Clinical Features 
Infranuclear and Nuclear Lesions: 
309 

III Nerve: In infranuclear paralysis, there is paralysis 
of the medial, superior and inferior recti, inferior 
oblique, levator palpebrae superioris and ciliary 
muscles resulting in: 
I.Diplopia, squint and ptosis
2.Eyeballs deviated laterally (Lateral rectus action)
and downwards (Superior oblique action).
The normal downward movement of Superior
oblique cannot be tested because the paralyzed
Medial rectus does not allow the eye to adduct.
Secondary action of the muscle is seen. The
eyeball is depressed. If the patient makes a
further attempt to look downwards, the eye will
rotate inwards (Intorsion) because the Superior
oblique pull sideways across the eye when it is
in this position.
3.Inability to rotate the eye upwards or inwards
4.Dilated and fixed pupils.
In nuclear paralysis there is paralysis of individual 
extraocular muscles but without ptosis or internal 
ophthalmoplegia. 
IV Nerve: In infranuclear paralysis there is paralysis 
of the superior oblique muscle resulting in: 
l.Diplopia and squint.
2.Eyeballs deviated upwards and inwards on the
same side.
3.Difficulty in reading or going downstairs due to
inability to move eyes downwards and inwards.
4. 
310 As the patient tries to move the paretic eye
downwards, there is absence of intorsion. The
weakness of the muscle in primary position
(looking straight ahead) allows the eye to rotate
slightly outwards (Extortion).
Light 
F,g. 6 79: Right sided third nerve paralysis PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
5.A very slight slant of the image would make the
patient tilt his head slightly away from the side
of the affected eye to line up the image from
the normal eye. Hence the head is tilted to the
opposite shoulder (Bielschowsky's sign) which
causes compensatory intorsion of the normal
eye and ameliorates diplopia.
In nuclear paralysis, IV nerve is affected on the op­
posite side as the IV nerve decussates dorsally before 
leaving the brainstem. 
VI Nerve: In infranuclear paralysis there is paralysis 
of the lateral rectus resulting in: 
1.Diplopia and squint
2.Eyeballs deviated medially
In nuclear paralysis, in addition there is facial palsy 
and associated brainstem signs. 
Supranuclear Lesion: 
1.There is paresis of conjugate gaze rather than
individual muscle paralysis.
2.There is no squint, diplopia or ptosis, as the visual
axes remain parallel.
Conjugate Gaze Palsies 
A.Lesion of the Frontal Cortex: This leads to
paralysis of contralateral gaze. Hence the eyes
are deviated to the side of the cerebral lesion and
opposite to the side of hemiplegia.
B.Lesion of the Occipital Cortex: Voluntary
movements are not affected but there is loss of
follow and reflex movements.
C. 
D. Lesions of the Basal Ganglia:
1.Irritative: Causes oculogyric crisis.
2.Destructive: Attempted upward gaze causes
jerky, vertical nystagmus, Parkinsonism
and Huntington's chorea.

upward gaze with loss of accommodation 
reflex. 
2.Inferior colliculi: Paralysis of the conjugate
downward gaze with loss of convergence
reflex.
E.Lesions of Pons:
This leads to paralysis of ipsilateral gaze, hence
the eyes are deviated to the opposite side i.e.
same side as hemiplegia.
Oculogyric Crisis 
Definition: Attacks of involuntary conjugate upward 
deviation of the eyeballs. Sometimes the eyes are 
deviated to one side. 
Causes 
1. Post-encephalitis
2.Parkinsonism
3.Petit ma! epilepsy
4.Phenothiazine
5.Neurosyphilis
6.Head injury

3.Trauma
4.Vascular
Localizing of Lesion: 
I.Within the brainstem: There will be other
features of brainstem lesions e.g. contralateral
hemiplegia.
II.In the basilar area: There will be multiple or
bilateral cranial nerve palsy:
The third nerve lesion occurs due to: 
A.Compression by a posterior communicating
artery aneurysm: Here the onset is acute with
pain and dilated, fixed pupils.B.Progressive damage by the prolapsing temporal
lobe as in tentorial herniation. Here the patient
becomes drowsy, with dilated pupils, ptosis and
finally full third nerve palsy.
In third nerve lesion due to compression, pupils
are dilated early because the pupilloconstrictor
fibers are located peripherally.
The sixth nerve is usually involved in raised
intracranial tension, which leads to tentorial
herniation and pressure of sixth nerve against
the petrous tip. Hence sixth nerve palsy does
not have localizing value.
III.At the petrous tip:
A.Mastoiditis: This causes Gradenigo 's
syndrome -lesion of V, VI, VII and VIII
nerves.
B.Carcinoma of nasopharynx and paranasal
sinuses: It may infiltrate through the fissures
of the skull and present as sudden painless
sixth nerve palsy.
IV.Around the cavernous sinus:
A.Cavernous sinus thrombosis:
1.Pain and edema over the eyelids
2.Ophthalmoplegia with exophthal­
mos
B.Aneurysm of the intracranial portion of
the carotid artery:
1.Pain and edema over the eyelids
2.Blindness
3.Exophthalmos
4.Third nerve palsy
5.Ifat 
the posterior end of the cavernous
sinus, there is associated VI nerve
palsy and irritation of the ophthalmic
division of the V nerve causes pain
over the face.
V.At the superior orbital fissure:
A.Ophthalmoplegia without exophthalmos
B.Pain over the face and loss of corneal reflex
(V nerve)
VI.In orbit:
A.Ophthalmoplegia with exophthalmos
B.Pain and redness of the eyes of Tolosa Hunt
syndrome
311 

VII.General:
A.Diabetes: Painful or painless
ophthalmoplegia where pupils are
always spared because diabetes causes
infarction involving only the central
portion of the nerve sparing the peripheral
pupilloconstrictor fibers.
B.Syphilis and Atherosclerosis will produce
painless ophthalmoplegia.
Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia (INO) 
It occurs due to lesion in the Medial Longutidinal 
Fascicules (MLF). Normally, on voluntary conjugate 
gaze (looking to one side), the Ipsilateral eye abducts 
(ipsilateral VI1h nerve) and simultaneously, the contra­
lateral eye adducts (contralateral IIl'd nerve). This is 
possible because of the MLF which connects the IIl'd 
and Vl'h nerve nucleii (Fig. 6.81). 
Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) is characterized 
by (a) Failure of adduction on same side of lesion of 
MLF and (b) weakness of abduction with nystagmus 
of the other side (Figure 6.82). It is classically seen in 
Multiple sclerosis.

movement ipsilaterally due to loss of function
of ipsilateral III and VI nerves (PPRF). Contra­
lateral eye cannot adduct due to lesion in MLF.
The only movement possible is weak abduction
of contralateral eye.
5.Eight and Half Syndrome : 11/z syndrome plus
involvement of 7th nerve nucleus ipsilaterally.
Fifth Nerve 
Anatomy 
The motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve is situated 
in the pons medial to the sensory nucleus. The motor 
root emerges from the anterolateral aspect of the pons 
and passes in the posterior fossa. It overlies the apex of 
the petrous bone and leaves the skull via foramen ovale 
to join the mandibular division (mandibular nerve). 
This supplies temporalis, masseter, pterygoids, tensor 
tympani, tensor veli palati, mylohyoid and anterior 
belly of the digastric muscles. The sensory root takes 
origin from the nerve cells in the Gasserian ganglion 
and enters the lateral surface of the pons. Fibers for 

( 6 ) Central Nervous System 
light touch and proprioception terminate in pons 
while those for pain and temperature terminate in 
the bulbospinal root that extends as low as the sec­
ond cervical segment of the spinal cord. Distal to the 
Gasserian ganglion the nerve divides into 3 divisions. 
The Ophthalmic (first) division supplies the conjunc­
tiva (except that oflower lid), lacrimal glands, medial 
part of the skin of the nose, upper eyelids, forehead 
and scalp as far as the vertex. The maxillary (second) 
division supplies the cheek, front of temple, lower 
eyelid and its conjunctiva, side of the nose, upper lip, 
upper teeth, mucous membrane of the nose, upper 
pharynx, roof of the mouth, soft palate and tonsils. 
The mandibular (third) division supplies sensations 
to the lower part of the face, the lower lip, ear, tongue 
and lower teeth. 
Testing: 
1.The motor function can be tested by asking
the patient to clench the teeth. Normally the
masseters and temporalis on both sides stand
out with equal prominence. If there is paralysis
on one side, the muscles on that side do not
become prominent (This can be better tested
by palpating the muscles than on inspection).

3. The patient is asked to open the mouth. Normally 
the jaw is central. If there is paralysis on one side, 
the jaw will deviate to that side being pushed by 
the healthy lateral pterygoid muscle. 
Fig.6.84 Masseters 
The sensory function is tested in all the three 
divisions separately, comparing both sides. Pain, 
temperature and light touch are tested. 
Lesions of individual divisions distal to the 
gasserian ganglion result in sensory loss confined 
to the cutaneous supply of the division. Lesions 
at or proximal to the Gasserian ganglion results 
in ipsilateral sensory loss of the whole face. 
Lesions within the brain stem and upper cervical 
cord results in an onionskin distribution of 
sensory loss ( the lateral forehead, cheek and jaw 
are affected). Dissociation of anesthesia over the 
face (i.e. pain and temperature are affected and 
touch is spared) occurs with lesions affecting the 
spinal tract and nucleus of the trigeminal nerve. 
The cutaneous area over the angle of the mandible 
is supplied by the second and third cervical roots 
(greater auricular nerve) and not the trigeminal 
nerve. Hence, a hemifacial sensory loss that 
spares the angle of the jaw is organic, whereas 
one that includes this area may be hysterical. 
The importan t reflexes conveyed by the 
trigeminal nerve are the corneal, conjunctival 
and the jaw jerk. 
Conjunctiva/ and Corneal Reflexes 
Afferent: Ophthalmic division of Trigeminal nerve. 
Reflex centre: Pons 
Efferent: Facial nerve 
313 

Method 
The patient should turn his eyes to opposite direction. 
The examiner should touch the cornea or conjunctiva 
from the side with a wisp of cotton. In response to 
this stimulus, normally there is blinking or closing of 
the same eye (direct response) and the opposite eye 
(consensual response). 
Significance: 
1.In unilateral trigeminal nerve lesion resulting in
corneal or conjunctiva! anesthesia, stimulation
of these structures fails to produce either the
direct or consensual response, but stimulation
of the opposite side elicits both responses.

In unilateral facial palsy with weakness

side but does not occur on the affected side. 
Hence, on stimulating the cornea on the affected 
side, direct response is absent but consensual

Fig 6.87: Corneal Reflex 
response is present, whilst on stimulating the 
cornea on the unaffected side direct response 
is present but consensual response is absent. 
3.The conjunctiva! response is less important
clinically than corneal response as it may be
absent in a few normal individuals and also in
hysteria.
Lesions 
l.Supranuclear lesion: Lesions interrupting the
corticobulbar pathway on one side may cause
contralateral trigeminal paresis. Bilateral lesion
(pseudobulbar palsy) causes profound weakness
of muscles of mastication and exaggerated jaw
jerk. Thalamic lesion may cause contralateral
anesthesia of the face.
2.Nuclear lesion: This is characterized byipsilateral
atrophy, paresis and fasciculation of muscles
of mastication, ipsilateral hemianesthesia of
the face, ipsilateral tremor and contralateral
hemiplegia. Internuclear ophthalmoplegia and
ipsilateral Homer's syndrome may also occur.
3.Gasserian ganglion lesion: There is severe pain,
paresthesia and numbness on the face from the
upper lip and chin to the anterior part of the ear
with hemianesthesia of the face and weakness
of muscles of mastication.
4.Cerebello-pontine lesion: Usually the ophthalmic
division is commonly affected resulting in early
loss of corneal reflex. There would be, in addition,
lesion of the seventh, eighth and sixth cranial
nerves.

6 ) Central Nervous System 
5.Gradenigo's syndrome: The lesion is at the apex of
the temporal bone. The osteitis or leptomeningitis
may cause damage to the ophthalmic division of
the fifth nerve and the sixth nerve causing pain
and sensory disturbances in the ophthalmic
distribution with ipsilateral lateral rectus palsy.
There may be partial Homer's syndrome (ptosis
and miosis) sometimes.
6.Cavernous sinus syndrome: Lesions within the
cavernous sinus may damage the ophthalmic and
maxillary division of the fifth nerve, the sixth,
fourth and third nerves. Usually the mandibular
nerve is spared.
7.Superiororbitalfissure syndrome:Thereisaffection
of the sixth, fourth, third and ophthalmic branch
of the fifth nerve with exophthalmos due to 
blockade of ophthalmic veins. Sometimes partial
Homer's syndrome and blindness may also occur.
Jaw Jerk 
Afferent: Sensory portion of Trigeminal nerve 
Reflex centre: Pons 
Method: The examiner places his index finger over 
the middle of the patient's chin, holding the mouth 
slightly open. He then taps his finger with the hammer. 
The normal response is slight and consists of closure 
of the mouth. 
Significance 
1.Since the normal response is slight, an absent
jaw jerk is not always pathological.
2.Jaw jerk is absent in peripheral lesions of the
trigeminal nerve.
3.It is brisk in supranuclear lesions of the pyramidal
tracts above the nucleus of the trigeminal nerve.Seventh Nerve 
Anatomy: The corticobulbar fibers controlling the 
facial movements arise in the lower third of the 
precentral gyms and pass down through the corona 
radiata, the genu of the internal capsule and the medial 
cerebral peduncle to reach pons. In the pons, major­
ity of the fibers decussate, ending in the facial motor 
nucleus on the opposite side. The ventral part of the 
facial nucleus, which innervates the lower two-thirds 
of the face, has a predominantly crossed supranuclear 
control. The dorsal portion, which supplies the upper 
third of the face, has bilateral supranuclear control. 
A separate supranuclear pathway for the control of 
involuntary movements originates in the globus pal­
lidus, hypothalamus and thalamus and then descends 
through the internal capsule in their course to the 
facial motor nuclei. 
The facial nerve nucleus is situated in the pons lat­
eral to that of the sixth nerve. The facial nerve fibers 
wind around the sixth nerve nucleus and emerges out 
medial to the eighth nerve. It then enters the internal 
auditory meatus to the geniculate ganglion. Here it 
gives a branch, the greater superficial petrosal nerve 
which innervates the lacrimal glands. At the posterior 
aspect of the middle ear it gives a branch, the nerve 
to stapedius which supplies stapedius muscle, and 
another branch the chorda tympani which joins the 
lingual nerve and supplies taste fibers to the anterior 
two-thirds of the tongue. The facial nerve then exits 
through the stylomastoid foramen giving the posterior 
auricular nerve, cigastric branch and the stylohyoid 
branch. It then pierces the parotid gland and divides 
into temporo-facial (temporal, zygomatic and upper 
buccal) and cervicofacial (lower buccal, mandibular 
and cervical) branches. 
Test: The motor function can be tested by inspection 
of facial expression and tests of facial mobility. The 
patient is asked to raise the eyebrows (frontal head 
of occipitofrontalis), wrinkle the brow (nasociliary), 
close the eyes (orbicularis oculi), show the teeth and 
repeating a sentence with several labial consonants 
( orbicularis oris) blow out the cheek (buccinator) and 
retract the chin (platysma). Any asymmetry is noted. 
The stylohyoid, posterior belly of digastric, occipitalis 
and auricular muscles cannot be tested adequately. 
Weakness of stapedius may cause hyperacusis for

low tones (because it no longer adequately tightens 
the ossicular chain that protects the inner ear from 
loud noise). 
The sensory function to be tested is the taste sensation 
on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Each half of 
the tongue should be tested with the four fundamental 
tastes ( sweet, sour, bitter and salty) and any asymmetry 
should be noted. 
The reflexes to be tested are corneal, conjunctiva! and 
jaw jerk (Refer fifth nerve). 
Diagnosis of Facial Palsy 
A.Asymmetry of the face
B.Stasis of food in the mouth

auditory meatus and pharynx. LMN VII nerve palsy, 
loss of taste, salivation, lacrimation and hyperacusis 
are present. VIII nerve may also be involved. 
Mobius Syndrome 
Congenital absence of VII nerve. Nucleus presents

Melkersson Rosenthal Syndrome 
Recurrence unilateral LMN VII Nerve Palsy with facial 
edema and fissured tongue. 
Eighth Nerve 
Anatomy: The eighth nerve consists of two parts-the 
cochlear (hearing) and the vestibular (equilibrium). 
The auditory fibers from the cochlear ganglion are 
distributed to the dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei 
in the pons. The vestibular fibers from vestibular gan­
glion terminate in a group of nuclei in the pons and 
medulla. The secondary auditory tract after partial 
decussation terminates in the inferior colliculi and 
medial geniculate bodies and then proceeds to the 
internal capsule and cortical centre for hearing. The 
vestibular nerve is connected with the cerebellum and 
then cerebrum. 
Tests: The eighth nerve should be tested for both the 
auditory as well as the vestibular functions. 
1.Auditory Function: Before testing the auditory
function, wax, if present, must be removed from
the ears. Hearing of slight sound in each ear must
be tested either with the watch ( tick of the watch)
or rubbing fingers. If there is impairment of 
hearing the following tests are done to determine
whether the disease is of the cochleovestibular
system or of the middle ear.A)Rinne's test: A vibrating tuning fork is
placed in front of the ear (air conduction)
and then on the 
mastoid bone (bone
conduction). Normally air conduction is
better than the bone conduction. In middle
ear disease, bone conduction is better
than air conduction. In nerve deafness air
conduction is better than bone conduction
but both are depressed.

vibrations are heard equally on both the 
sides. In middle ear disease, it is better 
heard on the affected side because external 
sound interfering with the vibration is less 
on the affected side. In nerve deafness, the 
vibrations are heard better on the healthy 
side. 
Vestibular Function: Derangement of vestibular 
function usually causes vertigo, dizziness, nausea 
and unsteady gait. Calorie and rotational tests are 
employed to produce change in the endolymph 
current in the semicircular canals. This results 
in nausea, dizziness and horizontal nystagmus 
when the vestibular apparatus is intact. These 
will be absent when vestibular function is lost. 
Ninth, Tenth and Eleventh Nerves 
Anatomy: The ninth, tenth and eleventh nerves arise 
in that order from above downwards, in an elongated 
nucleus in the floor of the fourth ventricle. They 
emerge along the lateral aspect of the medulla. The 
spinal part of the eleventh nerve (accessory) from the 
lateral columns of the spinal cord passes up through 
the foramen magnum and joins the cranial part of 
the accessory nerve and emerges with it through the 
jugular foramen. 
The ninth (glossopharyngeal) nerve supplies the 
sensations including the taste sensation to the pos­
terior one-third of the pharynx. It also supplies the 
middle constrictor of the pharynx and stylopharyn­
geus muscle. 
320 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
The tenth ( vagus) nerve is motor for soft palate ( except 
tensor palati), pharynx and larynx. It is sensory and 
motor for the respiratory passages, the heart and the 
abdo.minal viscera. 
The eleventh (accessory) nerve is a pure motor nerve 
for innervation of the larynx, pharynx, sternomastoid 
and trapezius muscles. 
Tests: 
1.The sensory part can be tested by testing the
superficial as well as the taste sensations over
the posterior one third of the tongue.
2.The motor function is tested as follows:
3. a)The patient is asked to open the mouth
and say "ah" and palatal movements on
both the sides are noted. Normally they
are equal and uvula is in the centre. In
unilateral palatal palsy, the median raphe
is pulled to the normal side, as palatal
movements on the affected side are absent.
In bilateral paralysis, the whole palate
remains motionless.
b)The trapezius muscle is tested by asking
the patient to shrug his shoulders against
downward resistance. Normally both the
sides are equal. In unilateral paralysis, there
will be weakness on the affected side.
c)The sternomastoid muscle is tested by
asking the patient to rotate his chin to the
opposite side. In unilateral paralysis, the
chin is deviated to the affected side and
there is impairment of rotation of the chin
to the opposite side.
The reflex function is tested by examining the 
gag reflex.

Gag Reflex 
Reflex centre: Medulla 
Efferent: Vagus 
Method: 
Stimulation of the posterior pharyngeal wall by a 
tongue blade or a cotton applicator results in eleva­
tion and constriction of the pharyngeal musculature 
accompanied by retraction of the tongue 
Significance 
1.The reflex may be absent or brisk in hysteria
2.The reflex is lost in lesions of the IX and X nerves.
Twelfth Nerve 
Anatomy: The twelfth (hypoglossal) nerve arises 
from the hypoglossal nucleus in the floor of the 
fourth ventricle in medulla oblongata. The fibers 
of hypoglossal nerve emerge medial to the fibers of 
glossopharyngeal nerve and unite into two bundles 
that pass separately through the dura mater and the 
hypoglossal canal of the skull. After leaving the skull 
the two bundles unite and pass in the neck and then 
to the tongue to which it supplies the motor branches. 
The supranuclear control is through the corticobulbar 
fibers. The genioglossus is controlled by contralateral 
corticobulbar tracts whereas the other muscles have a 
bilateral supranuclear control. 
Tests: The tongue should be observed at rest and on 
protrusion and various movements are noted. Uni­
lateral lesion may cause paresis, atrophy, furrowing, 
fibrillations and fasciculations on the affected half 
of the tongue. On protrusion, the tongue deviates to 
the paralyzed side due to unopposed action of the 
contralateral genioglossus. Bilateral weakness in ad-dition, causes dysphagia and dyspnea when the flaccid 
tongue falls back and obstructs the pharynx. Dysarthria 
especially ford and t phonemes occur. 
4 Bulbar Palsy 
Definition: Bulbar palsy refers to weakness of the 
lower cranial nerves with or without the affection of 
pyramidal, spinothalamic, proprioceptive and sym­
pathetic fibers due to lesion in the medulla oblongata. 
When the supranuclear fibers of these lower cranial 
nerves are affected due to a lesion in the pons, mid­
brain, internal capsule, corona radiata, basal ganglia or 
cerebral peduncles, the resultant weakness is referred 
to as pseudobulbar palsy. 
Causes 
I.Trauma: Basal skull fractures
II.Infections: Meningitis, encephalitis, bulbar,
polio, diphtheria, syphilis, tuberculosis
III. Vascular: Thrombosis, embolism, aneurysm and
hemorrhage
IV.Raised intracranial tension leading to
herniation of the medulla and cerebellar
tonsils:
Tumors, gumma, tuberculoma
V.Degenerative: Syringobulbia, Motor neurone
disease
VI. Demyelinating: Multiple sclerosis
VII.Congenital: Craniovertebral anomaly
VIII.Conditions mimicking bulbar palsy:
1.Myasthenia gravis
2.Tetanus
3.Rabies
Clinical Features 
I.Due to lesions of cranial nerve nuclei:
A.IX, X cranial nerves: Nasal twang, nasal
regurgitation, hoarse voice, dysphagia, loss
of sensations over the posterior one-third
of the tongue, weak cough and absent gag
reflex, weak cough reflex. In unilateral
lesion, there is never a complete paralysis
of deglutition or of articulation, but in
321 

II. extensive or bilateral lesions there may be 
profound impairment of these functions. 
B.XI cranial nerve: Weakness of trapezius and 
sternomastoid muscles.
C.XII cranial nerve: Dysarthria, wasting and
weakness of tongue muscles and sometimes
fibrillations over the tongue.
Due to damage to fiber tracts: 
A.Pyramidal tracts: Since pyramidal tracts
cross at the lower level of medulla, unilateral
lesion causes crossed hemiplegia. Due to
proximity of the two pyramidal tracts there
may be paraplegia or decerebrate type of
rigidity.
B.Spinothalamictrac ts:Sincethespinothalamic
tracts are crossed tracts, unilateral lesion
of these tracts lead to loss of touch,
temperature
C.Descending tract and nucleus of the
trigeminal nerve: This causes loss of touch,
temperature and pain on the same side of
the face.
D.Spinovestibular and vestibulospinal tracts:
Ipsilateral nystagmus and other cerebellar
signs.
E.Spinovestibular and vestibulospinal tracts:
Vertigo.
F. Sympathetic tract: Ipsilateral Homer's
syndrome.
G.Medial lemniscus: Ipsilateral loss of
proprioceptive sensations.
H.Medial longitudinal fasciculus: Ipsilateral
abducting nystagmus with weakness of
adduction in the opposite eye.
III.Vital functions:
Involvement of the dorsal efferent nuclei ofboth
vagus 
nerves or pressure on the medullary centres
may lead to:
1.Bradycardia and hypotension.
2.Respiratory failure.
3.Disturbance in gastrointestinal function.
4.Hyperglycemia
Differential Diagnosis 
1.Supranuclear lesions: Unilateral supranuclear
322 2. 
3. 
4. PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
lesions usually do not cause any neurological 
deficit because of bilateral corticobulbar input. 
However, bilateral lesions (pseudobulbar 
palsy) may cause severe dysphagia, explosive 
dysarthria, pathological laughter and crying, 
spastic tongue, severe retching and vomiting 
and exaggerated jaw jerk. The cough reflex is 
intact. 
Nuclear or Intramedullary lesions: This may 
lead to involvement of ninth, tenth, eleventh and 
sometimes twelfth nerve damage with pyramidal 
signs and other brain-stem signs as mentioned 
above. The common causes are syringobulbia, 
motor neurone disease, demyelinating disease, 
vascular lesion, malignancy and bulbar polio. 
In bulbar polio, often the long tract signs are 
absent. 
Jugular foramen syndrome: This consists of 
affection of the ninth, tenth and eleventh nerves. 
The common causes are glomus tumors and basal 
skull fracture. 
Retropharyngeal and retroparotid space 
lesions: The lesions in this area may affect 
the ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth nerves 
with or without affection of the sympathetic 
chain and seventh nerve. The common causes 
are retrophar yngeal carcinoma, abscess, 
lymphadenopathy, aneurysm, trauma or surgical 
procedures. 
5 > Hemi�leg_ ia __
Definition: Hemiplegia is paralysis of one half of the 
body i.e. upper and lower limbs of the same side. It 
may be associated with weakness of facial muscles 
on the same side (ipsilateral hemiplegia) or opposite 
side (contralateral hemiplegia). Hemiparesis signifies 
weakness.

hemiplegia is absent. 
Hoover's sign: The patient whilst lying on his back 
is asked to raise his leg against resistance. In a 
normal individual and in organic hemiplegia 
the back of the heel of the contralateral leg is 
pressed firmly down. This is absent in hysteria. 
Babinski's combined leg flexion test: The patient 
with organic hemiplegia when asked to sit up 
without using his arms, involuntarily flexes the

Todd's Post-epileptic Hemiplegia: 
Transient paralysis following convulsions. Recovery 
occurs within 24-48 hours. 
Determination of the Site of Lesion in 
Hemiplegia 
If the hemiplegia is associated with cranial nerve af­
fection on the same side (ipsilateral) then the lesion 
is above the brain stem. 
If the hemiplegia is associated with cranial nerve 
involvement but associated with loss of vibration and 
joint sense on the same side and pain, temperature 
and touch on the opposite side (Brown-Sequard syn­
drome), then the lesion is in the spinal cord between 
Cl and C4 segments. lpsilateral Hemiplegia 
A.Cortical lesion. If the patient has any one of the
following features, cortical lesion is suspected:
1.Mild hemiparesis or monoplegia
2.Convulsions
3.Cortical sensory loss -loss of tactile
localization tactile discrimination and
tactile extinction
4.Astereognosis
5.Aphasia (if dominant cortex is involved)
B.Internal capsule: This is the commonest cause
of ipsilateral hemiplegia and in the absence of
features suggesting cortical lesion, the lesion is
localized at the internal capsule. Hemiplegia is
always dense or complete because all the motor
fibers are condensed in a small area. There may
or may not be associated hemianesthesia or
hemianopia on the same side as hemiplegia.
C.Subcortical lesion: Hemiplegia is incomplete or
not dense and there are no features to suggest
cortical involvement.
Contralateral Hemiplegia 
A.Midbrain lesion:
B. 1.Webers syndrome: lpsilateral 3rd nerve
paralysis with contralateral hemiplegia.
2.Benedikts syndrome (red nucleus affected):
Third nerve affection on the same side with
tremors, rigidity and ataxia on the opposite
side.
Pontine lesion: 
l.Millard -Gubler syndrome: Nuclear type of
facial palsy with contralateral hemiplegia.
2.Fovilles syndrome: Facial palsy, sixth nerve
palsy and contralateral hemiplegia.
3.If in addition, the tegmentum is also
involved, there may be Homer's syndrome
due to paralysis of the ocular sympathetic
fibers.
C.Medullary lesion:
Jacksons syndrome: Twelfth nerve paralysis with
contralateral hemiplegia.

Lesions of the Spinal Cord 
Transverse Myelopathy: ( Complete spinal cord tran­
section): When there is complete transection, all the 
motor and sensory functions below the level of spinal 
cord damage are disturbed. 
1. 
2. Sensory: All sensations ( touch, pain, temperature, 
vibration and position) are impaired below the 
level of the lesion. Root pains or segmental 
paresthesia may occur at the level of the 
lesion. Localized vertebral pain (with tumors 
and infections) may be present and may be of 
localizing value. 
Motor: Paraplegia (paralysis ofboth lower limbs) 
329 

3. 
4. or quadriplegia (paralysis of all the four limbs) 
occurs below the level of the lesion. Initially, the 
weakness is flaccid and areflexic due to spinal 
shock, later, hypertonic hyperreflexic paralysis 
occurs. 
At the level of the lesion, lower motor neurone 
signs ( wasting, weakness, areflexia and paralysis) 
occur due to damage to the anterior horn cells 
or their ventral roots. 
Reflexes: Below the level of the lesion there is 
loss is superficial reflexes, extensor plantar and 
brisk deep reflexes. 
Autonomic disturbances: Anhydrosis, trophic 
skin changes, impaired temperature control, 
vasomotor instability, impotence and bladder 
disturbances may occur.

7. 
330 Traumatic spinal cord injuries: There is sudden 
onset of transverse myelopathyfollowing trauma. 
Recovery is usually uncommon. Electric shock, 
lightening or radiation expsoure may cause 
spinal cord transection immediately or after 
many years. 
Viral transverse myelitis: There is an acute or 
subacute onset of transverse myelopathy with 
tingling and numbness to start with. Recovery 
often occurs. 
Tuberculous transverse myelitis: Refer 
Tuberculosis of CNS. 
Anterior spinal artery thrombosis: There is an 
acute onset of transverse myelopathy but the 
posterior columns are not affected because they 
are supplied by the posterior spinal artery. 
Multiple sclerosis: This is common in young 
females between 20-40 years in age. There are 
characteristically relapses and remissions of 
primary optic atrophy, paraplegia and Charcot's 
triad (staccato speech, intention tremors and 
nystagmus). 
Post Infectious demyelination : This is 
characterized by paraplegia after viral infections 
with neurotropic viruses like mumps, measles, 
rubella, chicken pox, small pox. Complete 
recovery usually occurs. 
Post-vaccinial demyelination: This is 8. 
9. PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
characterized by paraplegia following 
vaccination. Recovery may occur. 
Compression myelitis: This is characterized 
by subacute or gradual onset of one or more 
features of transverse myelopathy . There is 
usually presence of root pains due to irritation 
of the nerve roots at the level and sometimes 
pain, tenderness, rigidity and deformity of the 
vertebral column. 
Neoplasms: The spinal neoplasms may be 
intramedullary, extramedullary or extradural. 
Differences between intramedullary and 
extramedullary tumors are as follows: 
Multiple Transverse Levels 
Multiple transverse levels may occur in the following: 
1.Arachnoiditis
2.Multiple secondaries
3.Multiple neurofibromatosis
4.Spinal angiomas
5.Disseminated sclerosis
Hemisection of the Spinal Cord 
1.Sensory: Loss of pain and temperature on the
opposite side and loss of position and vibration
sense on the same side below the level oflesion.
Hyperaesthethic band at level of lesion.
2.Motor: Spastic monoplegia of lower limb or
hemiplegia may occur below the level of the
lesion on the same side. Segmental lower motor
neurone signs occur at the level of the lesion.
3.Reflexes: Below the level of the lesion on the same
side, superficial reflexes are lost, deep reflexes
are brisk and plantars are extensor.
Causes: Extramedullary lesion 
Lesions Affecting Spinal Cord 
Centrally 
1.Sensory: The decussating fibers of the
spinothalamic tract conveying pain and
temperature sensations are affected initially
causing analgesia and thermoanesthesia in a
suspended bilateral distribution. Touch, position
and vibration sensations are normal (dissociate
anesthesia). Affection of the spinothalamic and

Motor: When the forward extension affects the 
anterior born cells, segmental atrophic weakness 
occurs. Dorsomedian and ventromedian motor 
nuclei causing scoliosis. Pyramidal tract affection 
causes spastic weakness below the level of the 
lesion. 
Reflexes: The deep reflexes at the level of the 
lesion are lost. Below the level, deep reflexes 
are brisk, superficial reflexes lost and plantar 
extensor. 
4.Autonomic disturbances: Affection of the
ciliospinal centre of Budge with C3 -T2 lesion
may cause Homer's syndrome.
Causes 
1.Syringomyelia: This is a chronic progressive
disorder in which cavitation occurs in the
central gray matter of the spinal cord usually
cervical, and sometimes extends into the lower2. brain-stem (syringobulb ia). It is common in 
males between 25-40 years age. There is gradual 
onset of the above signs. In addition, trophic 
changes, kyphoscoliosis and pes cavus occur. 
If syringobulbia occurs, there is affection of 
ninth, tenth, and eleventh cranial nerves, 
nystagmus and Horner's syndrome. 
Hematomyelia: This resembles syringomyelia 
but the onset is acute following injury and there 
is involvement of all the four limbs. 
3.Intramedullary tumors: This resembles
syringomyelia in presentation and is often
difficult to differentiate clinically.
N .B: In acute central cord syndrome, after hyper exten­
sion injury of the neck, the patient becomes quadriplegic 
due to cervical trauma but within a few hours regains 
strength in the legs. However severe motor impairment 
in the arms remains (man in a barrel syndrome) due 
to damage to the gray matter at the cervical spinal cord 
enlargement. 
Lesions of Posterior Column 
1. 
2. 
3. Sensory: There is loss of touch, position 
and vibration sense. With demyelination in 
the cervical region, neck flexion may elicit a 
sensation of electric discharges that spreads 
inferiorly throughout the spine and lower limbs 
(Lhermitte's sign). Other conditions when this 
sign is positive : Multiple Sclerosis, Cervical 
Spondylosis, Syrinyx, SACD, Cervical Tumours, 
Early radiation myelitis. 
Motor: There is hypotonia but normal power. 
Gait is high stamping and Romberg's sign is 
positive. 
Reflexes: Deep reflexes especially the ankle jerk 
may be lost. 
Causes: Tabes dorsalis, Diabetic pseudotabes 
Lesions of Posterolateral Columns 
1.Sensory: Loss of touch, position and vibration
sense, especially of the lower limbs. If there is
associated peripheral neuropathy, in addition,
there will be glove and stocking type of anesthesia
and calf tenderness.
2.Motor: There is spastic paraparesis with
Romberg's sign positive.
331 

3.Reflexes: Deep reflexes in the lower limbs may be
brisk. Ankle jerk may be lost if there is associated
peripheral neuropathy. The superficial reflexes
are usually lost and plantar reflex is extensor.
Causes: 
1.Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal
cord: This occurs due to deficiency of vitamin B 12
usually after the fourth decade. There is usually
associated pernicious anemia and histamine-fast
achlorhydria. Neurological features are as below:
2. Sub-acute myelo-optic neuropathy (SMON):
This commonly occurs in the elderly patients who
are habituated to take large doses of enteroquinol
for long periods. In addition to the above features,
there is optic atrophy.
3.Pellagra: This is characterized by diarrhea,
dementia and dermatitis in addition to the above
features.
4.Taboparesis: This is common in younger patient
with history of exposure. There are always mental
changes and often Argyll Robertson pupils
present.
5.Friedreich's ataxia: This is a heredofamilial
autosomal recessive disorder of early onset
involving, in addition to the pyramidal tracts and 
posterior columns, spinocerebellar tracts ( which 
causes truncal ataxia, titubation, nystagmus and 
slurred speech), optic atrophy, kyphoscoliosis, pes 
cavus and cardiac abnormalities ( cardiac failure,
heart block, bundle branch block, Twave changes). 
This is a steadily progressive disorder ultimately 
leading to death due to intercurrent infection, 
cardiac failure and complications of associated 
diabetes. 
6.Nutritional myelopathy: This is due to protein
calorie malnutrition and resembles subacute
combined degeneration of the spinal cord.
Skin changes of vitamin deficiencies are usually
evident.

There is difficulty in walking and unsteadiness 
of gait which is more pronounced in darkness. 
There is ataxia and spastic weakness oflegs with 
profound distal loss of postural and vibration 
sense with bilateral extensor plantars. 
L'Hermitte's sign is positive (due to posterior 
column involvement) 
Concurrent peripheral neuropathy is 
evidenced by loss of ankle jerks impairment 
of superficial sensations in glove and stocking 
pattern. 
Mild impairment of memory called 
"megaloblastic maddness".

3. Spinomuscular atrophy: This is characterized 
by bilateral affection of the proximal group of 
muscles usually in the first or second decade. 
The disease has a slow progressive course. 
Diabetic amyotrophy: There is asymmetrical 
wasting and weakness of proximal muscles in 
uncontrolled diabetes. 
4.Syphiliticamyotrophy: There is asymmetrical
wasting and weakness of proximal muscles in
a patient with history of exposure and positive
VDRL tests.
Combined Anterior Horn and 
Pyramidal Tract Disease 
This is seen in motor neurone disease as below: 
Motor Neurone Disease 
The disease process affects the motor neurones of the 
CNS, which are the Betz cells, cranial nerve nuclei and 
anterior horn cells. There is associated involvement of 
the pyramidal tracts. 
Types: 
1.Progressive muscular atrophy -affection of the
anterior horn cells.
2.Primary lateral sclerosis -predominant affection
of the pyramidal tracts in the spinal cord.3. 
4. 
5. 
6. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -affection of both 
the pyramidal tracts and anterior horn cells. 
Progressive bulbar paralysis -affection of the 
cranial nerve nuclei in the medulla. 
Pseudobulbar palsy -affection of the pyramidal 
tract in the brain stem. 
Combination of 4 and 5. 
Motor neurone disease has a gradual onset, 
and although there are 6 varieties, they merge 
into each other and, in a given patient various 
combinations may be found. Hence they are 
grouped under the common name of motor 
neurone disease. 
Progressive muscle atrophy is the most benign 
of them, survival being over 10 years. However, 
once bulbar palsy sets in, prognosis is poor. The 
clinical features are shown in the table above. 
Variants of Motor Neurone Disease

8 > M_1-asthenia Gravis __ 
Is a neuromuscular disorder characterised by weak-
340 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
ness and fatiguability of skeletal muscles due to 
decrease in number of Acetylcholine receptors at the 
neuromuscular junction due to antibodies. It is an 
autoimmune disorder. 
A. Incidence : Common in men in 50s and 60s;
women 20s and 30s; women more frequently
affected than men.
B.Clinical features
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. Onset is insidious or subacute, rarely acute 
External ocular movements are weak. There 
may be unilateral or bilateral ptosis. 
Pupils are always Spared 
Facial: Weakness of orbicularis oculi is 
quite constant. Retractors of the angles 
of the mouth suffer more than elevators 
resulting in snarling smile. 
Other cranial nerves: There is palatal palsy. 
Involvement of the masseters prevents 
closure of mouth (hanging jaw sign). 
There may be nasal speech and ultimately 
respiratory paralysis. 
5.Limbs: Proximal weakness initially in the
shoulder girdle, later on may be generalized
6.The weakness is more in the evening and
disappears after a night's rest. Usually there
is no wasting or loss of deep reflexes.
7.Muscle groups commonly involved in
decreasing order are bulbar, neck, limb
girdle, distal limb and trunk.
8.If respiratory muscles are affected,
mechanical ventillation may be required
and patient is said to be in a "Myasthenia
crisis".
C.Diagnosis
1.Clinically :
a.Breath Holding Time : Breath
counting are done to assess vital
capacity,
b.Forward arm abduction (> 5 mins),
c.On sustained upward gaze increased
ptosis may occur,
d.Single breath count
2.ACH receptor Antibodies : Generalised :
90% positive. Occular : 50% positive
-

( 6 ) Central Nervous System 
3.Anti MUSK Antibodies (muscle specific
kinase) positive is 40% of negative cases.
4.Tensilon test: Edrophonium 2 mg is given
IV.If muscle power is improved within 30
seconds and sustained improvement for 2-3
mintues test is positive. It can be repeated
with 8 mg if required.
5.CT scan (To look for thymoma) Thymus is
enlarged in 70% of MG cases.
6.Electrophysiological study.
a.Repetitive nerve stimulation -
decremental pattern.
b.Single fibre EMG -Increased
variability of interpotential interval.
D.Treatment
1.Pyridostigmine Orally 30 -120 mg every
4-8 hours, titrated individually for each
patient.
2.Corticosteroids : IV or oral
3.Plasma Exchange : Removes antibodies,
used in crisis.
4.Immunomodulators : Azathioprine,
cyclophosphamide, mycophendlate
mofetil, tacrolimus
5.Thymectomy : In patients under 60 years,
improves symptoms.
E.Drugs contraindicated in MG :
Antibiotics : Aminoglycosides, Quinolones,
Muscle relaxants: pancuronium, D Tubocuan,
Betablockers, local anaesthetics, quinine, as
these worsen the muscle weakness.
9 > Cerebellum 
Cerebellum is an infratentorial structure in the pos­
terior cranial fossa, attached to the brain stem by the 
superior, middle and inferior peduncles through which 
nerve fibers enter and leave. It has two lateral lobes 
and a central vermis. 
There are four nuclei in the cerebellum: 
Dentiform, Emboliformis, Fastigious and Globosus. 
Functionally it can be classified as : 
1.Archicerebellum: This is connected to the
vestibular nuclei for maintaining equilibrium.2.Paleocerebellum: This is connected to the spinal
cord, for maintaining posture.
3.Neocerebellum: This is connected to the cerebral
cortex by pontine and olivary connections for
voluntary movements.
Connections 
Through the superior peduncle ( connects cerebellum 
and midbrain): 
A.Afferent: Ventral Spinocerebellar tract-It arises
from the nuclei on the medial side of the Clark's
column, crosses on the opposite side, ascends up
to the midbrain and then again crosses, entering
the anterior lobe of the cerebellum on the same
side. It receives impulses from the Golgi tendon
type IB. lt sends inhibitory impulses to the motor
neurones.
B.Efferent: Cortico-pontocerebellar tract -It
arises from the lateral lobes and via the superior
peduncle crosses to the opposite red nucleus.
From the red nucleus it goes to the ventrolateral
nucleus of the thalamus from where it goes to
the cerebral cortex.
Through the middle peduncle ( connects cerebellum 
and pons): 
Efferent: Cortico-pontocerebellar tract -Fibers from 
the cerebral cortex along the corticospinal tract pass 
to the cerebellum with a relay in the nuclei of the pons. 
Through the inferior peduncle ( connects cerebellum 
and medulla): 
A.Afferent:
B. 1.Dorsal-spinocerebellar tract: From the
Clark's column situated deep in the
posterior horn, it enters the anterior lobe of
the cerebellum via the inferior peduncle. It
receives afferents from the muscle spindle
type IA.
2.Olivocerebellar tract: From the
extrapyramidal system to the lateral lobes
of the opposite cerebellum.
3.Vestibulocerebellar tract: From the vestibular
nucleus to the flocculonodular lobe.
4.Cuneocerebellar tract.
Efferent: 
1.Fastigiobulbar tract: To the reticular area
for the control of tone
341 

1.Fastigiovestibular tract: To the vestibular
nucleus for maintenance of equilibrium

Clinical Features of Cerebellar Lesions 
I.Of Localizing Value
A.Disorders of postural fixation
(Paleocerebellum)
1.Hypotonia
2.Weakness
3.Pendular Knee Jerk: If the patellar
tendon is stimulated while the feet
are hanging free, there is a series of
jerky to and fro movements of the leg
1 Yi times back & fourth before the leg
finally comes to rest. This response
is normally prevented by the 'after­
shortening' of the quadriceps femoris.
Pendular knee-jerk is caused by the
hypotonicity of flexor and extensor
muscles of the knee and the lack of
restraining effect which they normally
exert upon each other.
4.Past pointing.
5.Barany's test: Slow fall of the
outstretched arm on the side of the
lesion, when the patient, with his eyes
closed and one arm outstretched, is
asked to move the limb and bring it
back to its original position.
B.Disorders of movements (Neocerebellum)
1.Intention tremors : Increased
irregularity of the movements as the

< 6 > Central Nervous System 
finger approaches the nose in the 
finger nose test. This results from the 
involvement of the cerebellar afferent 
pathways in their connection with the 
red nucleus and thalamus. 
2.Dysmetria: Inability to arrest the
movements at desired points due to
loss of ability to gauge the distance,
speed and power of movement.
3.Dyssynergy: Defective coordination
of various muscles and muscle
groups participating in a movement.
Therefore there is decomposition of
movements and the act is broken
down into its component parts.
4.Dysdiadochoki nesia: There is
disturbance of reciprocal innervation
of agonists and antagonists. Hence,
there is loss of ability to stop one
act and follow it immediately by
a diametrically opposite act. This
is seen when the patient attempts
alternate successive pronation and
supination of the hand, rapid tapping
of the fingers or alternate opening and
closing of fists.
5.Rebound phenomenon: Failure of
antagonist to counter overshoot
movements totally.
C.Disorders of Gait
1.Broad base
2.Reeling gait
3.Deviation to the side of the lesion
4.Truncal ataxia
5.Titubation
II.Of No Localizing Value
1.Static tremors: Tremors at rest due to
hypotonia. 
2.Skew deviation: Homolateral eye turns
downward and inward and contralateral
eye turns upwards and outwards.
3.Nystagmus: With the hemisphere lesion,
the eyes at rest are deviated towards the
unaffected side. When the patient attemptsto focus his vision elsewhere, the eyes move 
towards the point of fixation with quick 
jerks and there are slow return movements 
to the resting point. The movements are 
more marked and of greater amplitude 
when the patient looks towards the affected 
side. 
4.Vertigo: Objects move away from the side
of the lesion. Sense of rotation of the body
in same direction with intra cerebellar
lesion and in opposite direction with extra
cerebellar lesion.
5.Speech disturbance: Staccato, scanning or
explosive 
speech. Sometimes dysarthria.
Differential Diagnosis 
Trauma: History of trauma prior to the onset of cer­
ebellar disorders. 
Encephalitis: Usually causes acute cerebellar signs. 
Disturbance of external ocular movements including 
nystagmus, are more prominent.

10 > Tuberculosis of 
Nervous S stem -----------
Tuberculosis can affect the nervous system in the 
following ways: 
I.Meningitis
II.Tuberculoma
III.Vasculitis causing infarcts
IV.Tuberculosis of the spine causing Pott's paraplegia
V.Intraspinal granulomas
VI. Arachnoiditis 
I.Tuberculous Meningitis (TBM)
A.Pathology
1.Meninges: At the base of the

( 6 Central Nervous System 
brain, a mass of gelatinous exudate 
obliterates the cisterna pontis and 
cisterna interpeduncularis and 
extends anteriorly along the floor of 
the third ventricle to cover the optic 
chiasma and distal ends of the internal 
carotid arteries. The meninges over 
the convexity of hemispheres are less 
involved. 
2.Brain: Diffuse brain involvement
commonly occurs due to:
a)Edema in the absence ofinfarction
b)Infarction more common in the
middle carotid territory
c)Tuberculoma
B.Relation of pathological lesions to signs
and symptoms
1.Meningeal exudate:
a)Hydrocephalous.
b)Cranial nerve palsy.
c)Meningeal sign.
2.Infection of brain substance:
a)Clouding of consciousness.
b)Convulsions.
c)Hypothalamic and brain stem
signs.
3.Arteritis and vascular obstruction:

5.In children: Progressive spasticity,
decerebrate state, convulsions, coma.
There is a greater incidence of
hydrocephalous, convulsions and
brainstem signs with decerebration
in children.
6.Of complications
D.Clinical Stages

sensorium.
3.Meningeal signs with neurological
involvement and impaired sensorium.
E.Effect of Treatment
Antituberculous treatment modify the
course of the illness. If the treatment
is started early, prompt and complete
remission occurs. If it is started late is not
of much avail. Although the patient may
recover, he may be left with sequelae.
F.Sequelae
1.Due to basal exudates:
a)Hydrocephalous
b)Cranial nerve palsy: Deafness,
blindness and ophthalmoplegia
2.Due to spinal block: Paraplegia,
quadriplegia
3.Due to arteritis: Hemiplegia
4.Miscellaneous:
a)Mental disturbances
b)Convulsions
c)Endocrine disturbances
d)Ectopic ossification of the hip joint
G.Treatment
1.Antituberculous Drugs:
Those that diffuse freely through
345 

the blood-brain barrier are INH, 
rifampicin, pyrazinamide, cycloserine 
and ethionamide. Drugs that diffuse 
only in the presence of meningeal 
inflammation are streptomycin and 
ethambutol. A combination therapy 
is given for at least 1-1/2 years total 
of 18 months with two or three of 
the following: Streptomycin, Isonex, 
Ethambutol, Rifampicin, Cycloserine, 
Pyrazinamide and Ethionamide. 
2.Steroids:

c)Deroofing the fourth ventricle
4.Spinal Block:
a)Oral steroids.
b)Intrathecal 50 mg
hydrocortisone.
c)Intrathecal streptodornase and
streptokinase.
d)Surgical decompression
arachnoiditis.
II.Tuberculoma
346 A.Definition: Single or multiple lesions
or tumor-like masses of characteristic
granulation tissue which produces
symptoms of a space-occupying lesion.
B.Pathogenesis: Tuberculomas result from
hematogenous spread of infection from
lungs, lymph nodes, peritoneum, kidney,
bone, skin, etc. The early lesion appears in
the cortex or the subcortical region and
consists of a central area of incipient or
frank necrosis surrounded by epithelioid
or giant cells. In some, polymorphs may
be seen.
Initially microscopic foci are multiple
and around the perivascular area. The
lesion enlarges through expansion of thePRACTICAL MEDICINE 
individual foci and later by means of their 
conglomeration. Thus, tuberculomas are 
formed which remain isolated or merge 
together to form a solid mass. 
The ultimate evolution depends on hyper­
sensitivity and immune responses. Healing 
occurs by fibrosis and calcification which 
impairs the oxygen supply to the organisms 
by obliterating their vascular channels. 
There is little participation of fibroblasts 
till the lesion reaches the surface meninges.

ataxia account for 10% of the cases, 60-70%
return to normal life.
III.Tuberculosis of The Spine: Pott's Paraplegia
A.Mechanisms of Paraplegia
1.Fluid abscess in the spinal canal
2.Paraspinal abscess invading the spinal
cord
3.Granulation tissue encircling the dura
4.Sequestrated bone
5.Dislocation of the vertebra

B.Clinical Picture
1.Paraplegia in a 
known case of spinal
tuberculosis: It may begin at any
time and during any phase or stage
of the vertebral disease, even after
apparently sound healing. It is the
commonest mode of presentation
and easy to diagnose.
2.Paraplegia as a presenting symptom
a)Pain and tenderness in the affected
partb)Muscle spasm
c)Restricted spinal movements
d)Deformity -Gibbus
e)Palpable cold abscess

a)Deformity
b)Diminished joint space
c)Calcification
d)Cold abscess
3.Spinal tumor syndrome
There is evidence of spinal cord
compression without any clinical or
radiological evidence of the disease
of the spine. An X-ray usually
reveals abnormality in majority of
the cases but usually it is detected
retrospectively.
4.ParaplegiaduetoTB oftheposterior

lamina
b)Clinically there may be local pain
with progressive paraplegia
c)X-ray

tissue
ii)Destruction of the affected
part
C.Treatment
1.Medical: Refer TB meningitis
2.Surgical
a)Indications:
i)Paraplegia whilst patient is
under adequate conservative
treatment for spinal
tuberculosis.
ii)Paraplegia is deteriorating
despite conservative treatment
iii) Paraplegia is of rapid onset
iv)Paraplegia is complete or
severe
v)Paraplegia is recurrent
347 

vi)Paraplegia is due to disease of
the posterior neural arch
vii) Spinal tumor syndrome
viii) When conservative treatment
is usually hazardous or
impossible e.g. Bed sores,
spasms spasticity make
immobilization hazardous
or in old age, where
immobilization is dangerous.
b)Methods
i)Anterolateral decompression:
The spinal canal is exposed
through thelateralextra pleural 
approach and intraspinal
abscess, granulation tissues
or debris anterior to the spinal
cord are removed.
ii)Casto-transverse section: This
is useful in a poor risk patient.
It is not useful for intraspinal
tumors as the abscess is
evacuated without exposing
the spinal canal.
iii)Anterior approach: Full
visualization of the lesion is
allowed by a wider anterior
exposure, tofacilitatecomplete
excision of all the diseased and
devitalized tissues and to
provide for immediate fusion
by strut graft when there is
compression between two
adjacent healthy vertebral
bodies.
iv) Laminectomy: It is contra­
indicated in TB of the
vertebral body. However, it
is the only correct approach
in spinal tumor syndrome
and posterior neural arch
involvement.

11 > Cerebrovascular 
Diseases 
Blood Supply of Cerebral Hemispheres 
Cerebral hemispheres 
receive blood supply from Carotids and Vertebral arteries. Right carotid arises 
from the arch of the aorta and left carotid arises from 
brachiocephalic which arises from the aortic arch. 
Vertebrals arise from the subclavian arteries and the 
two vertebrals join to form the basilar artery which 
then bifurcates into two terminal branches-right and 
left posterior cerebral arteries. The carotid and vertebral 
artery system join at the base of the brain to form the 
circle of Willis. 
The Anterior Cerebral Artery (ACA) 
ACA runs anteriomedially to the interhemispheric 
fissure, where it joins the opposite ACA by anterior

communicating artery (anterior portion of Circle of 
Willis -Fig. 6.71). ACA gives origin to 
1.Medial lenticular branches which supply dorsal
aspect of the optic chiasma and hypothalamus,
and the medial striate artery (Heubner's artery)
which supplies blood to the anteroinferior limb
of the internal capsule and anterior aspects of
putamen and caudate nuclei.
2.Callosal branches which supply the septum
pellucidum and the fornix.
3.Hemispheric branches which supply the medial
surface of the hemisphere and upper border of
frontal and parietal lobes.
The Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) 
MCA supplies most of the lateral surface of the ce­
rebral hemisphere and deep structures of the frontal 
and parietal lobes. It gives lenticulostriate arteries, 
which nourishes the adjacent corona radiata, external 
capsule, claustrum, putamen, part of globus pallidus, 
body of the caudate nucleus and superior portion of 
the anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule. 
Other branches are orbitofrontal and anterior temporal 
arteries. The main trunk then divides into proximal 
and distal group of arteries. 
The Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA) 
PCA are the terminal branches of the Basilar artery 
and supplies the occipital lobes, the inferomedial 
portions of the temporal lobes, medial ventral, lateral 
ventral, posterior and superior thalamus, hippocampus 
fornices and psalterium. 
Cerebrovascular Syndromes 
Stroke: It is a relatively abrupt onset of focal neurologi­
cal deficit resulting from diseases of arteries or veins 
that serve the central nervous system. 
Types 
1. 
2. 
350 Completed stroke: It is the term applied to the 
temporal profile of the stroke syndrome in which 
the deficit is prolonged and often permanent. 
Most of them reach the maximum of neurological 
dysfunction within an hour of onset. 
Stroke in Evolution: It is the term applied to 
the temporal profile in which the neurological 
deficit occurs in a step wise or progressive 
fashion, culminating in a major deficit in the PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
absent of treatment. In carotid territory if the 
progression has stopped for 24 hours, it is not 
likely to progress. However in vertebro-basila r 
territory the deficit may progress for up to 72 
hours. 
Transient lschemic Attacks (TIA) 
TIAs are sudden episodes of focal non-convulsive 
neurologic dysfunction that completely resolves within 
24 hours but mostly by 1 hr. They are vascular in etiol­
ogy and commonly last 2-15 mins and are followed 
by complete recovery. 
1.TIA in Carotid system: This is characterized by
one or more of: 
a)Ipsilateral amaurosis fugax
b)Contralateral hemiplegia
c)Contralateral hemianesthesia
d)Contralateral homonymous hemianopia
e)Aphasia
2.TIA in Vertebrobasilar system: This is
characterized by one or more of the following:
a)Bilateral or shifting motor or sensory
dysfunction
b)Bilateral homonymous hemianopia
c)Diplopia, dysphagia or dysarthria by
itself are not considered TIAs, however
in combination with (a) or (b) should be
considered as vertebrobasilar TIAs.
Causes 
I.Cerebral Infarction (85%): This may be due to
a)Thrombosis: Due to atherosclerosis, syphilis
or TB 
b) Embolism: This involves predominantly
MCA and PCA. ACA and Basilar arteries
are not commonly involved. Embolus may
arise from
1.Heart: Myocardial infarction,
mural thrombus arrhythmias,
valvular heart diseases, mitral valve
prolapse, prosthetic valves, infective
endocarditis, marantic endocarditis,
congenital heart disease, cardiac
tumors.
2.Extracranial Vasculature

{ 6 ) Central Nervous System 
c)Lacunarinfarction is related to hypertension
and affects small penetrating vessels ofbasal
ganglia or brainstem.
II.Hemorrhage ( 15%): This could be subarachnoid
intra-cerebral or intraventricular, and may be
due to:
1.Hypertension
2.Saccular aneurysms
3.Arteriovenous Malformations

I.Carotid Artery Syndrome
Occlusion of the ICA in the neck may be
asymptomatic in the presence of adequate

Lacunar Infarctions 
Lacunae are small ischemic infarcts that range in 
diameter from 30 -300 µm and result from occlu­
sion of the penetrating arteries, chiefly from anterior 
choroidal, middle cerebral, posterior cerebral or basilar 
arteries. The most frequent sites are putamen, bases 
pontis, thalamus, posterior limb of internal capsule 
and caudate nucleus. The primary pathology is lipo­
hyalinosis of the arteries. 
Long-standing hypertension and atherosclerosis are 
common predisposing factors. TIAs shortly before 
the onset of a lacunar stroke is frequent, but head-ache is infrequent. Although they usually carry good 
prognosis, multiple lacunae may cause pseudobulbar 
palsy and dementia. 
Clinical Syndromes 
1. 
2. 
3. Pure motor hemiparesis: Lacunae in internal 
capsule or basis pontis causes opposite face 
and arm weakness more than leg. There is no 
aphasia, apractagnosia, sensory, cortical or visual 
disturbances. 
Pure Sensory stroke: Lacunae in ventral lateral 
nucleus of thalamus causes paresthesias and 
hemi-sensory loss on opposite side. Subjective 
symptoms are much more than objective sensory 
loss. 
Ataxic Hemiparesis: Lacunae in posterior limb 
ofinternal capsule or basis pontis cause weakness 
predominantly in the legs and incoordination of 
the arm and legs without dysarthria and facial 
involvement. 
4.Dysarthria -Clumsy hand syndrome: Lacunae
deep in basis pontis causes supranuclear facial
palsy, dysarthria, deviation of the tongue and
loss of fine motor control of the hand.
Treatment of Acute lschemic Stroke and 
Transient lschemic Attack (TIA) 
1.Anti-hypertensive drugs: BP should not be
lowered precipitously. BP must be lowered only in
severe cases (systolic BP> 200 mmHg). Usually
Calcium antagonists are preferred. Nimodipine,
a cerebroselective calcium channel blocker, can
be used.
2.Intravascular volume must be maintained
3.Osmotic therapy with mannitol may be given
to control edema of large infarcts, but isotonic
volume must be replaced to avoid hypovolemia.
4.Anticoagulants: Initially with heparin, including
low molecular weight heparins.
Thrombolysis 
Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator (rtPA) is 
approved for thrombolysis in acute stroke. 
Dosage: 0.9 mg/kg -(10% as bolus, remaining over 
60 minutes) maximum of90 mg.

E.Subcortical white mater (10-15% of cases)
The first four hemorrhages described
above are commonly due to hypertension.
However, subcortical white mater or
lobar hemorrhages are due to other
causes. The clinical syndrome produced
by lobar hemorrhage resembles occlusive
cerebrovascular diseases.
Mechanism of Neurological deficits in 
Hemorrhage 
The blood that escapes from the blood vessels into the 
cerebral tissue directly injures the axons, cell bodies, 
glia and arterioles and venules, which may contribute 
to continued bleeding. 
Hemorrhage in the periventricular brain is likely to 
rupture through the ependyma into the ventricular 
system with immediate impairment of consciousness 
and potential for delayed development of obstructive 
hydrocephalus. 
As the escaped blood clots, vasogenic brain edema 
develops because blood brain barrier is disrupted. 
The zone of vasogenic edema surrounds the clot. 
Breakdown of constituents within the clot may create 
an osmotically active region that draws water into the 
clot from surrounding edematous brain. The combined Table 6.30 : Differences between

effects of blood clot and vasogenic edema acts as a

syndromes. 
Cerebral Berry Aneurysms 
Cerebral aneurysms are more common in females and 
increase with age. Aneurysms under 1 cm diameter 
are not likely to rupture. 
They are characterized by absence of one layer of 
the vascular wall (muscular media) and absence or 
fragmentation of elastic lamina. Anterior circulation 
has 85% and posterior circulation 15% of aneurysms. 
Fifteen to twenty percent have multiple aneurysms. 
Congenital factors are responsible for the defects of the 
vessel wall, but since it increases with age, degenerative 
processes also may be responsible. 
The three common sites of aneurysm are: 
1. 
2. 
3. Junction of anterior communicating with 
anterior cerebral artery 
Junction of internal carotid and posterior 
communicating artery 
Main division of middle cerebral artery .

Causes 
I.Primary
1.Saccular aneurysm
2.Arteriovenous malformation
3.Vasculitis
4.Cortical thrombophlebitis
5.Blood dyscrasias
6.Spontaneous
II.Secondary: Intracerebral hemorrhage leaking
into the ventricular system.
Clinical Features 
I.Symptoms of raised intracranial pressure: There is
a sudden onset of severe, excruciating headache
which radiates to the neck and is increased by
neck flexion, Valsalva's maneuver and head
movements. It is associated with vomiting
papilledema and altered consciousness. Rarely
syncope, convulsions, confusion and low back­
pain may occur.
II.Signs of Meningeal irritation: Once blood has
leaked into subarachnoid space there is usually 
neck stiffness, positive Kernig's sign and positive
Brudzinski's sign.
III.Associated Signs of aneurysm: Ocular pain due
to mass effect or paralysis of oculomotor cranial
nerve may be present.
IV.Focal Signs: Focal signs are usually absent.
However they may occur due to spasm of the
surrounding artery, intracerebral extension,
cerebral edema or mass effect from extra­
parenchymal hematoma. The focal signs may
be sudden visual loss, hemiparesis, aphasia and
sensory loss.
Clinical Grades (Hunt 1967) 
Complications 
I.Neurological
1.Rebleeding: Bleeding may recur within
3 days and peaks at 7-10 days after the
initial bleed. It declines after 30 days and
long-term recurrence of bleeding occurs
in 3.5%
2.Vasospasm: This may occur in 30% of cases
... 

( 6 ) Central Nervous System 
due to release ofvasoactive substances from 
blood into the subarachnoid space. Spasm 
induced ischemia may lead to hemiparesis, 
cortical sensory loss, hemianopia, altered 
consciousness and urinary incontinence. 
3.Others: Hydrocephalus, cerebral edema
and convulsions, hyponatremia cerebral
salt wating syndrome.
JI. Medical 
l.Pulmonary: Neurogenic pulmonary edema
pneumonia, atelectasis, etc.
2.Cardiac: Cardiac arrhythmias like
premature beats, ventricular tachycardia,
ventricular fibrillation, etc. These are due to
stimulation of autonomic nervous system
by subarachnoid blood.
3.Others: Urinary tract infection, vaginitis,
gastrointestinal hemorrhage, thrombo­
phlebitis and SIADH
Management 
I.Medical
l.Measures to reduce the raised intracranial
tension: Mannitol 350 mg. intravenously
daily for 3-4 days, furosemide 40 mg orally
or glycerol 50-200 ml. orally daily are useful.
Dexamethasone 4 mg 6 hourly parenterally
also helps to lower the intracranial tension.
2. General Measures: Bed-rest (for atleast 3
weeks and about 6 weeks if surgery is not
contemplated), analgesics, stool softeners.
3.Antihypertensive drugs: If BP is high, it
should be lowered with appropriate drugs.
BP should be lowered very gradually and
not abruptly, as it will disrupt cerebral
autoregulatory reflexes.
4. Nifedipine 10 mg sublingual is useful to
immediately lower the blood pressure, it
could be repeated after 10 to 15 minutes
up to 40-60 mg. Diazoxide and Sodium
nitroprusside are other useful drugs.
However they have to be given IV and are
hence not used nowadays.
5.Nimodipine 30 mg, tds, is the drug of choice
as it is a specific cerebrovascular Calcium
channel antagonist. It is available IV also.6.Antiplatelet agents: Low dose Aspirin (75 to
325 mg) and Ticlopidine have been used.
7.Anticoagulants: Warfarin when indicated.
8. Epsilon amino caproic acid (EACA) 24-48
gm/day protects against recurrence of
hemorrhage by preserving the clot that
ultimately seals the bleeding point.
9.Management of unconscious patient: See
Coma
10.Symptomatic treatment: Analgesics like
dextro propoxyphene or paracetamol are
useful for severe headache.
II.Surgical
1.Aneurysmectomy: If the berry aneurysm
is on the surface of the brain, it must be
removed or ligated because there is a high
incidence of recurrence of the bleeding in
the second and third week.

12 Parkinsonism 
Parkinsonism is a disorder of the extrapyramidal 
system, characterized by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia 
and postural disturbances. 
Parkinson's Disease (Paralysis Agitans) 
Parkinson's disease (PD) most commonly affects 
persons over the age of 55 years, and is characterized 
by : bradykinesia, rest tremor, rigidity and postural 
instability. (Atleast two of these and a response to 
levodopa should be usually present to make the di­
agnosis). The substantia nigra has two parts, the pars 
reticulata (made up of nonpigmented cells) and the 
pars compacta (made of pigmented neurons). 
Pathophysiology: The disease is uncommon before the 
357 

age of 40 years and there is a slight male preponderance. 
The Parsi community in Bombay had an age-adjusted 
prevalence ratio of 192/100,000, which is higher than 
that in most other studies. The incidence of PD is less 
in smokers but the cause of this is not known. 
The corpus striatum has a rich concentration of ace­
tylcholine (Ach). Ach is synthesized and released by 
small striatal neurons, upon which it has an excitatory 
effect. Dopamine is synthesized by the pigmented 
neurons (pars compacta) of the substantia nigra and is 
transported via the nigrostriatal pathway to the corpus 
striatum, where it has an inhibitory effect on striatal 
neurons. It is thought that a functional equilibrium 
exists in the striatum between acetylcholine (which 
is excitatory) and dopamine (which is inhibitory). 
In PD, there is a loss of pigmented neurons in the 
substantia nigra in the midbrain and locus ceruleus 
in the pons, with characteristic intracytoplasmic, 
eosino-philic inclusion bodies (Lewy bodies) in the 
surviving neurons. As a result, the dopamine content 
in the corpus striatum is markedly decreased. At 
least 80% of the pigmented neurons in other parts of 
the CNS and also of certain nonpigmented neurons, 
especially in the nucleus basalis of Meynert (in the 
substantia innominata). 
There may also be a decrease in other neurotransmit­
ters like noradrenaline, 5 hydroxy-tryptamine (5 HT), 
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), enkephalins and 
substance P. 
The concentration of acetylcholine in the striatum is 
preserved but in those with dementia, acetylcholine 
content in the cerebral cortex is decreased, probably as 
a result ofloss of neurons in the substantia innominata. 
Moreover, demented patients with PD, like those with 
Alzheimer's disease, also have a loss of somatostatin 
neurons in the cortex. Low 5 HT concentrations in the 
brain, may contribute to the depression commonly 
seen in patients with PD.

Clinical Features 
The progression of 
the disease is usually gradual over 
many years but occasionally it may be more rapid 
over a few months. 
1.The initial symptom is usually tremor involving
one hand, which then spreads to involve the leg
on the same side before becoming bilateral. It
may also involve the head and jaw. The tremor
is present at rest at a rate of 4-6 per second. It
is absent during sleep. It is partially relieved
by complete relaxation, when the patient is in
a relaxed state of mind and during action. It is
aggravated by anxiety. In some patients, there is
also a faster, postural tremor at a rate of 7-8 per
second. Other characteristics of parkinsonian
tremor are supination -pronation of the forearm,
adduction-abduction of the thumb and flexion -
extension of the fingers ( which gives rise to the
'pill rolling' tremor commonly seen).

-----� ·--· - -
2.Rigidity manifests symptomatically as stiffness of
the muscles and mainly involves the neck, trunk
and proximal parts of the limbs. It is described as
'lead pipe' rigidity because the increase in muscle
tone is present throughout the range of movement.
When tremor is super-imposed on the rigidity,
there is a 'cog wheel' effect, which is most easily
elicited at the wrist and elbow.
3.Bradykinesia implies a difficulty in initiating
voluntary movement (such as getting up from
a chair) and a slowness of movement which
results in a progressive increase in the time taken
to perform daily activities. This is probably the
most disabling feature of Parkinson's disease.
Moreover, spontaneous movements like arm
swing while walking are absent.
4.Postural abnormalities manifest as a flexed
posture of the trunk and limbs together with a
difficulty in maintaining one's balance when that
posture is disturbed by an external force.
5.Face: The combination of these four cardinal
features gives rise to characteristic signs and
symptoms. The face has a mask like appearance
with few spontaneous movements of expression
and a staring appearance because of decreased
blinking of the eyes. On tapping the glabella, the
patient continues to blink with each tap ( unlike
in normal individuals where the blinking stops
after a few taps).6.Eye movements are usually normal except
for difficulty in convergence. There may be
some limitation of upward gaze and minimal
disturbances of saccadic and pursuit eye
movements.
7.The voice is slow, monotonous and oflowvolume.
8.Increased sweating and seborrhea is often noted
on the face. There is difficulty in swallowing,
especially later in the disease course, with
consequent dribbling 
of saliva.
9.The handwriting becomes small (micrographia)
and untidy.
10.Movements: Because ofbradykinesia the patient
often sits still in one posture with little movement
for a long time. He may have difficulty in getting
up from the chair or bed and in the later stages
even rolling over in the bed may not be possible.
Voluntary movements become slow and the
patient takes a progressively longer time to
perform everyday activities like dressing and
bathing. Repetitive movements like supination
-pronation of the forearm or tapping the floor
with the feet are slow and of low amplitude.
But sometimes, when the patient is agitated or
startled, he is capable of rapid movement but
this is only temporary.
11.Constipation is very common and urinary
frequency and incontinence may also be present.
12.Gait: One of the earliest signs of Parkinson's disease
is loss of arm swing while walking. The gait has
other characteristic features. 'Freezing' implies a
difficulty in starting to walk (start hesitation) and
also an inability to maneuver through narrow
passages such as through a doorway or around
an obstacle (gait hesitation). The gait is usually
shuffling and slow. Some patients have a festinant
gait in that progressive steps become faster, as
though the patient is chasing his centre of gravity.
This may end in a fall.
The posture is stooped with flexion of the neck,
trunk and limbs. The arms are adducted, flexed
at the elbow and wrist; there is ulnar deviation of
the hand and flexion of the metacarpophalangeal
joints with extension at the interphalangeal
joints. When the patient is standing, a slight
push forwards or backwards may make the
359 

patient take a few steps in that direction to 
keep his balance propulsion and retropulsion 
respectively) and the patient may even fall. This 
is because the patient is unable to make the slight 
postural adjustments normally required to keep 
one's balance. Spontaneous falls are not frequent 
early in the disease. Postural hypotension may 
be present in a few patients. 
There are no objective sensory impairments 
( other than an impairment of olfactory sensation 
in some patients). Both the deep and superficial 
reflexes are normal and there is no significant 
decrease in muscle power. 
13.Cognitive and psychiatric complaints are common.
Some of them may be side effects of drugs
(e.g., confusional states, hallucinations and
psychosis). About 40% of patients suffer from
depression even early in the disease. The patient
may also have difficulty in making decisions
and may become dependent on others. There is
thought to be a premorbid personality type in
PD (introspective, rigid, diffident). The intellect
is usually well preserved but late in the disease
course about 15% of patient will develop frank
dementia ( when dementia is defined by DSM-III
criteria).
Progress and Mode of Death 
In most patients the disease progresses gradually over 
about 10 years until they become wheelchair-bound 
or bed ridden because of severe bradykinesia, rigid­
ity and postural instability. Death may occur from 
aspiration pneumonia, septicemia from urinary tract 
infection, decubitus ulcers or from secondary causes 
like vascular disease or neoplasia. 
Diagnosis 
The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is based on the 
clinical symptoms and signs and by excluding other 
causes of Parkinsonism ( secondary Parkinsonism and 
Parkinsonism -plus syndromes). 
Conditions which may initially be confused with PD 
are essential tremor and depression, which are far 
commoner conditions. 
Essential tremor is often inherited as an autosomal 
dominant trait. It may appear at any age. It is mainly 
360 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
a postural tremor at a frequency of 5-8 per second, 
there usually being no tremor at rest. Other signs and 
symptoms of Parkinson's diseases are absent. Charac­
teristically, alcohol reduces or abolishes the tremor and 
beta blockers and primidone are also useful. 
Patients with depression often have an expressionless 
face, stooped posture and relative immobility and these 
may be confused with PD. Moreover, depression is a 
common accompaniment of Parkinson's disease and 
some who ultimately develop PD have depression as 
their presenting symptom. But in such cases, other 
features of PD will become manifest within a period 
of one year. 
Other causes of psychomotor retardation should be 
considered and these include the normal aging pro­
cess, drug intoxication, systemic illness, frontal lobe 
syndromes, akinetic mutism, catatonia, subcortical 
dementia, normal pressure hydrocephalus and other 
movement disorders. 
Blood and CSF examination and cerebral imaging stud­
ies such as CT and MRI scans are non contributory in 
making the diagnosis of PD but may be of use when 
there is a suspicion of other causes of Parkinsonism. 
Positron emission tomography (PET) scans, when 
available, will show a decreased uptake in the striatum 
in patients with PD. 
Staging 
The Hoehn and Yahr Scale can be of use in assessing 
the severity of the disease and to decide the line of 
management. 
Table 6.31 : Staging : Hoehn and Yahr 
Scale 
Stage I Unilateral involvement 
Stage II Bilateral involvement but no postural abnor­
malities. 
Stage Ill Bilateral involvement with mild postural imbal­
ance; the patient leads an independent life. 
Stage IV : Bilateral involvement with postural instability; 
the patient requires substantial help 
Stage V : Severe, fully developed disease; the patient is 
restricted to bed and chair. 
I.Anti-Parkinsonism Drugs
Drugs used in the treatment of PD (with the
possible exception of deprenyl), do not alter the
progression of the disease but they do enable the
patient to remain independent and functional
for a longer period.

( 6 ) Central Nervous System 
The decision as to when to start treatment and 
with what drugs depends on the predominant 
symptoms at that time, the functional capacity 
of the patient and whether the patient is able 
to carry out his occupation and activities of 
daily life with reasonable efficiency. The staging 
system of Hoehn and Yahr can be of use in 
making this decision but the decision should 
be individualized for each patient. 
Drug treatment should be delayed as long as 
possible, and when started, the dose of the 
drug should be gradually increased until the 
required benefit is achieved. The goal should 
be to relieve the symptoms to manageable levels 
and not necessarily to give complete relief from 
symptoms. This is because all the drugs have 
got side effects, both short term and long term, 
which are minimized by using smaller doses of 
the drugs. 
A.Patients in stages I and II of the Hoehn and
Yahr scale either require no treatment
or may be treated with anticholinergics,
amantadine or deprenyl.
1.The anticholinergics are mainly useful
in decreasing the rest tremor. These
drugs attempt to maintain the ratio
between dopamine and acetylcholine
in the striatum. Commonly used
drugs are trihexyphenidyl (1 to 2 mg
qid), benztropine (0.5 to 1.0 mg tid),
benzhexol hydrochloride (2 to 5 mg
qid) and orphenadrine (50 mg qid),
starting with a small dose. Frequent
side effects are dryness of the mouth,
constipation and slight blurring
of vision which are not harmful in
themselves. They should be used
with caution in the elderly, as they
can cause acute urinary retention and
confusion. They are contraindicated
in patients with glaucoma as they may
precipitate an acute rise in the intra
ocular tension.
2.Amantadine is more effective than
anticholinergics and is also useful
in decreasing the tremor. It is anantiviral drug but in addition itreleases stored dopamine frompresynapt ic terminals. Therefore it isonly useful in the early stages of the
disease. The usual dose is 100 mg bid.
Side effects include ankle edema and
livido reticularis (a reddish mottling
of the skin of the lower extremities),
both of which are not harmful) but
in higher doses it may cause an acute 
confusional state. 
3.Deprenyl (selegiline) is a monoamine
oxidase B inhibitor which inhibits the
catabolism of dopamine in the brain
(unlike MAO-A inhibitors which
inhibit the catabolism of dopamine in
the peripheral tissues). It could retard
the progression of PD as judged by
the duration of disease after which it
becomes necessary to start levodopa.
When used in conjunction with
levodopa, it decreases the amount
of levodopa required. Moreover, it
is also useful in the management of
the long term side effects oflevodopa.
Because of these properties, there is
a trend to use deprenyl early in the
course of PD. The average dose is 5
to 15 mg/day given in divided doses
twice a day.
B.Patients in stage III, IV and V of the Hoehn
and Yahr scale usually require levodopa.
Anti-cholinergics or amantadine may
be used in conjunction with levodopa
to increase its efficacy or relieve specific
symptoms like rest tremor.
l.Levodopa is the cornerstone of drug
therapy for Parkinson's disease. A
good response to the drug is seen
in at least 75% of patients. The most
beneficial effect is on bradykinesia
and postural instability.
Dopamine does not cross the blood
brain barrier but its precursor
levodopa does. In the brain, levodopa
is converted to dopamine by dopa­
decarboxylase, thereby replenishing
361 

362 the dopamine loss in the striatum. 
When given alone, it is converted to 
dopamine by dopa-decarboxylase 
present in peripheral tissues and 
only about 5% of the dose enters the 
brain. To prevent this, a peripheral 
decarboxylase present in peripheral 
tissues and only about 5% of the 
dose enters the brain. To prevent 
this, a peripheral decarboxylase 
present in peripheral tissues and 
only about 5% of the dose enters the 
brain. To prevent this, a peripheral 
decarboxylase inhibitor (either 
carbidopa or benserazide) is used in 
combination with levodopa. Such a 
combination markedly decreases (by 
about 80%) the amount oflevodopa 
required. 
Plain levodopa tablets are available 
but most patients receive levodopa­
carbidopa combinations (L-C). These 
combination tablets are available 
as L-C 275 (250 mg levodopa; 
25 mg carbidopa), L-C 110 (100 
mg levodopa; 10 mg carbidopa and 
L-C Plus (100 mg levodopa; 25 mg
carbidopa). The combination of
levodopa and benserazide (in a ratio
of 4: 1) is not widely available.
L-C is started in small dose (e.g.
half a tablet of L-C Plus tid or qid)
and gradually increased every few
days to achieve the required benefit.
Even though the maximum dose of
L-C 275 is about 6 to 8 tablets/day,
there is a strong indication to use
dopamine agonists or deprenyl in
patients whose symptoms are not
adequately controlled by smaller
doses oflevodopa. If a patient who is
on plain levodopa is to be started on
L-C, there should be at least a 12-hour
gap between the discontinuation of
levodopa and the starting of L-C.
Early side effects of levodopa are 
nausea, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmias 
and orthostatic hypotension. These 
are due to peripheral conversion to PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
dopamine and are usually relieved by 
the addition ofcarbidopa. In addition, 
domperidone and taking the drug after 
meals are also effective in relieving 
the gastrointestinal side effects. An 
overdosage of levodopa can result in 
psychiatric and cognitive symptoms 
(such as delirium, hallucination and 
psychoses) and dyskinesias. 
MAO-A inhibitors (used as 
antidepressants) are contraindicated 
and sympathomimetics should be 
used with caution as these can cause 
an acute rise in the blood pressure. 
Levodopa is contra-indicated in 
patients with malignant melanoma 
since levodopa is a precursor of 
melanin and may thus induce a 
recurrence of melanoma. 
At least 65% receiving plain levodopa 
or L-C (without dopamine agonists 
or deprenyl) develop long term side 
effects in varying severity after 2-5 
years: 
a.Some patients, especially those
with dementia, show a decreased
response to the drug. Increasing
the drug dose often results in an
acute confusional state.
b.In the 'wearing-off' effect, the
duration during which the drug
is effective becomes progressively
less. In such cases, the total daily
dose should be given at more
frequent intervals (sometimes
every 1 to 2 hours) with a conco­
mitant decrease in the amount of
each dose.
c.In the 'on-off' effect, the patient
fluctuates between 'on' periods
with activity (and often also
dyskinesias) and 'off' periods
with akinesia and rigidity. These
fluctuations are unpredictable,
sudden and not related to the
timing of drug intake.

( 6 > Central Nervous System 
Both the 'wearing-off' and 'on-off' 
effects are often associated with 
dyskinesias which take the form 
of choreoathetotic movements. 
These side effects may be due to 
defective absorption oflevodopa 
because IV administration of the 
drug often results in a more stable 
clinical state. 
These late onset side effects of 
levodopa are difficult to treat. 
The addition of deprenyl or 
dopamine agonists together with 
a decrease in the dose oflevodopa 
may be of help and, the early 
introduction of either of these 
drugs may delay and minimize 
these side effects. Omitting 
levodopa completely has not 
been found to be useful and may 
even be harmful because of severe 
akinesia postural disturbances 
and rigidity which may result. 
Experimenta lly, sustained-release 
forms of L-C and subcutaneous 
administration of a dopamine 
receptors agonist (e.g. lisuride) 
via an infusion pump, are being 
tried to minimize these long term 
side effects. 
2.The dopamine receptor agonists are
bromocriptine, pergolide and lisuride.
There are two known dopamine
receptors in the brain-D1 and D2• 
Stimulation ofD, receptors increase
intracellular cyclic AMP but the
same is not true on stimulation
of D2 receptors. D2 receptors are
more important in alleviating the
motor symptoms of Parkinsonism
but stimulation of D1 receptors
may produce additional benefit.
Bromocriptine acts only on D2 
receptors. The usual dose is 15 to
30 mg/day given in divided doses
(tid or qid), starting with a small
dose (2.5 mg HS). Pergolide (1 to4 mg/day) given tid or qid acts 
both on D, and D2 receptors and 
therefore may be more powerful 
with a longer duration of action 
than bromocriptine. The side effects 
are similar to those of levodopa 
except that abnormal involuntary 
movements are less prominent and 
neuropsychiatric side effects may 
be more marked. 
II.Other drugs:
1.Since depression is a common
accompaniment, it should be identified and
treated with tricyclic antidepressants and/
or ECT when required. MAO-A inhibitors
are contraindicated in patients receiving
levodopa as they may cause an acute rise
in the blood pressure.
Psychiatric and cognitive symptoms such
as confusional states, hallucinations and
psychoses are more common in elderly
patients who may also be demented. These
symptoms are often caused or aggravated by
the antiparkinsonian medication. In such
cases, decreasing the dosage of the drug
can be of use and, if necessary, psychosis
can be treated with clozapine ( which does
not have significant extrapyramidal side
effects).
2.Patients in whom a faster postural tremor
predominates will benefit from beta
blockers (propranolol -40 to 80 mg tid;
metoprolol) or primidone (50 mg HS,
increased gradually to a maximum of 250
mg/day).
III.Regular exercise Program
Parkinson's disease is usually a slowly progressive
disease and this should be impressed upon the
patient and his relatives so that the patient is
encouraged to live an independent life for as
long as possible. A regular exercise program
and accessory aids, when necessary, will help
in achieving this objective. In the later stages,
the help of a physiotherapist will be of value.
IV.Prevention of precipitating factors
Patients with PD have an aggravation of
363 

symptoms if ther� is any super added illness and 
therefore infections should be promptly treated 
and surgery avoided unless absolutely necessary. 
V.SurgeryPRACTICAL MEDICINE 
and metoclopramide block the dopamine 
receptors) but anticholinergics are effective. The 
parkinsonian symptoms usually subside within 
a few months after discontinuation of the drug. 
Small surgical lesions of the globus pallidus
or ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus using
steriotaxic techniques reduces or abolishes
the tremor and rigidity in the contralateral
limbs but does not benefit the bradykinesia
and postural instability. At present it is rarely
resorted to because of more effective drugs and
the morbidity associated with the procedure.
But it may be used in exceptional cases where
the patient is young and has incapacitating
tremor and rigidity on one side of the body
which are resistant to drugs. Adrenal medullary
transplant to the corpus striatum was initially
thought to be helpful but its value has not been
substantiated. At present, trials are on to the
assess the usefulness of transplantation of fetal
substantia nigra neurons.2. 
3. Infections: The patients with post encephalitic 
Parkinsonism tend to be of a younger age 
group than those with idiopathic PD and the 
Parkinsonism symptoms are usually milder and 
progression is slow. Moreover, other features such 
as oculogyric crisis, dyskinesias, tics, diplopia or 
other focal neurological deficits are frequently 
present. Response to levodopa is usually good. 
Vascular: Parkinsonism resulting from multiple 
small infarcts have long standing, poorly 
controlled hypertension and also other features 
of multi-infarct dementia such as pseudobulbar 
palsy, exaggerated tendon reflexes, extensor 
plantars and a short stepped gait, apart from 
impairment of cognition. Response to levodopa 
is poor. 
Secondary Parkinsonism 4.Toxins: MPTP is converted in the glial
cells of the brain to MPP+ by the action of
monoamine oxidase B. MPP+ is then taken up
into dopaminergic neurons via the dopamine1.Drugs: Reserpine (especially in large doses)

re-uptake system. Once in the dopaminergic 
neurons, MPP+ combines with neuromelanin, 
releases toxic free radicals and thus destroys the 
dopaminergic neurons. Experimentally, it has 
been found that MPTP toxicity can be prevented 
by deprenyl ( a monoamine oxidase B inhibitor), 
mazindol (a dopamine re-uptake blocker) and 
vitamins C and E (which are antioxidants and 
free radical scavengers). 
MPTP induced Parkinsonism is very similar to 
idiopathic PD both clinically and pathologically 
and also in its response to levodopa. 
5.Metabolic: Post anoxic Parkinsonism is often
accompanied by dystonic postures and athetoid
movements. Levodopa may be helpful.
This term includes other neurodegenerative conditions 
of unknown etiology, which have other characteristic 
features in addition to Parkinsonism. 
The following features should suggest that the patient 
may not have Parkinson's disease but rather one of the 
other causes of Parkinsonism:-
a.Early onset of Parkinsonism
b.Early loss of postural reflexes with frequent falls

13 > Coma 
Definition: "Coma" is derived from the Greek "Koma" 
meaning deep sleep. Coma has been defined as absence 
of any psychologically understandable response to 
external stimuli or inner need. 
Signs of Coma 
The signs in a comatose patient may be due to: 
I.Altered physiological functionII.Raised intracranial tension
III.Herniations syndromes.
I.Altered physiological function
In a comatose patient five parameters may be altered 
which are assessed. 
1.State of consciousness: This is the level of the
individual awareness and the responsiveness of
his mind to himself, the environment and the
impressions made by his senses. Various terms
used in the past to define different degrees of
coma are:
a.Coma: There is a complete loss of
consciousness from which the patient
cannot be aroused by painful stimuli, all
reflexes are lost including corneal, light
cough, swallowing, etc.
b.Stupor: This is astateofpartiallossofresponse
to the environment. The patient is difficult to 
arouse and though he can be briefly aroused,
it is slow and inadequate. The patient is
otherwise not aware ofhis environment and
falls back into the stuporous state.
c.Lethargy or hypersomnia: This is morbid
drowsiness or prolonged sleep from which
the patient can be aroused or awakened. He
appears to be in complete possession of his
senses but goes back to sleep as soon as the
stimulation is removed.
d.Syncope: This is transient, partial or
complete suspension of consciousness with
impaired circulation and respiration, pallor,
perspiration and cold skin.
e.Fugue state: This is a disturbance of
consciousness, lasting hours or days, in
which the patient performs purposeful acts,
but later, consciously fails to remember
actions carried out during that period.
f.Confusion: This is a mild lowering of the
level of consciousness. There is impaired,
capacity to thinkclearlyand with customary
rapidity, and to perceive, respond to and
remember questions or directions.
g.Delirium: This is characteri zed by
confusion, disordered perception and loss
365 

of attention. There is marked disorientation 
in time, excitement and hyperkinesia.

ness and predicts the outcome. The scale comprises 
three tests: eye, verbal and motor responses. The sum 
of the three values is calculated. The minimum GCS 
is 3 (deep coma or death), while the maximum is 15 
(fully awake person). GCS 11-15 has a good prognosis, 
5-10 intermediate and 3-4 poor prognosis.
2.Respiratory patterns: Comatose patients
often have characteristic respiratory pattern
depending upon the site oflesion and its etiology.

5 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
a.Hyperventilation: This is present with
hypoxia, acidosis, salicylate poisoning,
severe infections, brain compression and
psychogenic causes.
b.Hypoventilation: This is present with
respiratory failure, sedative-narcotic
overdosage and brain-stem compression.
c.Cheyne-Stokes respiration: This is
characterized by alternate periods of
hyperpnea and apnea. It is present with
bilateral cerebral hemisphere dysfunction
as in hypertensive or metabolic diseases. It
also occurs with impending transtentorial
herniation.
d.Central Neurogenic Hyperventilation
( CNH): This is characterized by a sustained,
rapid, regular and deep hyperpnea. It is
seen in lesions of Ascending Reticular
Activating System (ARAS) and often
suggests transtentorial herniation with
mid-brain compression.
e.Apneustic breathing: This is characterized
by a pause at full inspiration indicating
lesion oflower pons.
f. Ataxic or cluster breathing: This is
characterized by irregularly irregular
breathing pattern and is seen with
compression of medulla oblongata.
It must be noted that CNH, apneustic and 
ataxic breathings are common in patients with 
structural lesion in brain. Hence if they are present 
in a patient with metabolic coma, it suggests 
herniation. 
3.Pupils: Equal and normally reactive pupils suggest
that the oculomotor nerve and the upper brain­
stem are intact. Full and conjugate eye movements
suggest that midbrain and pontine tegmentum
are intact.
a.Pupillary reaction helps to differentiate
structural from metabolic causes of coma.
Pupillary pathways are relatively resistant
to metabolic insult and hence in metabolic
disorders, pupils are reactive to light. Absence of 
light reflex suggests structural lesion, asphyxia,
hypothermia and drugs like barbiturates,
atropine and glutethimide.
b.Fixed and dilated pupils suggest instillation of

( 6 > Central Nervous System 
mydriatic drops or direct trauma to the orbit 
or oculomotor nerve. 
C. Hippus: This is spontaneous, rhythmic
constriction and dilatation of pupils which
suggest mid-brain damage.
e.Irregular pupils: 1-2 mm irregularity may be
normally present or may occur with early
oculomotor nerve palsy, trauma or mydriatic
eye drops.
4.Eye movements and Ocular reflexes:
a.Conjugate gaze to one side suggests ipsilateral
frontal lobe lesion or contralateral pontine
lesion.
b.Sundown deviation is seen with mid-brain
compression.
C. Ocular bobbing occurs with primary pontine
hemorrhage.
d.Horizontal eye roving is seen with mild
metabolic coma.
e.Doll's eye movements or oculocephalic reflex:
On vertical or horizontal rotation of the head,
conjugate deviation of the eyeballs occur on the
opposite side ifbrainstem is intact. Ifbrainstem
is damaged the eyes follow the direction
of the head rotation. In hypoglycemia and
hepatic encephalopathy this response is brisk.
However, as the metabolic coma progresses,
the abnormal response eventually ensues. This
reflex must not be attempted if there is doubt
about trauma to the cervical spine.
f.Caloric response or oculovestibular reflex: After
the external auditory canal is cleared of wax,
the patient is put in supine position with head
elevated to 30° and the external canal is then
irrigated with cold water (7°F below body
temperature). This will result in horizontal
nystagmus with fast component to the opposite
side ifvetibulo-oculomotor brainstem pathways
are intact. In metabolic or structural brain-stem
lesion, there is dysconjugate ocular movement.
In sedative-hypnotic overdose, a forced
asymmetrical downward deflection may be
present.
g.Cilio-spinal reflex: A noxious stimulus over
the skin of neck, face or upper trunk causes
bilateral pupillary dilatation if the sympathetic
pathways are intact.
h.Corneal reflex: On touching the cornea with5. 
II. 
Ill. a wisp of cotton, there is blinking of both the 
eyelids if fifth and seventh cranial nerves are 
intact. This reflex is absent early in posterior 
fossa or brainstem lesion. 
Motor response: Distinct motor response 
can occur in various levels and types of coma. 
Application of noxious stimuli leads to various 
postures: 
a.Decorticate posture: Flexion of any or all the
limbs suggests lesion in the descending motor
pathways above rostral mid-brain.
b.Decerebrate posture: Extension of the limbs
suggests lesion in the midbrain and upper
pons due to herniation or toxic or metabolic
disorder.
c.Triple flexion: Decerebrate upper extremities
with lower limb flexion is triple flexion
response which results from the spinal reflex
secondary to damaged descending . motor
tracts.
d.Cortical response: When there is lesion of
the cerebral hemispheres, several motor
and behavioral patterns, similar to those of
a normal infant functioning at the thalamic
level appear. They are bilateral symmetrical
such as sucking, snorting, grasping, motor
perseveration and gegenhalten (increased
muscle tone to passive movements).
Raised lntracranial Pressure (ICP) 
The normal ICP is 2-15 mm of Hg. It is raised 
with any space-occupying lesion in the brain. 
The symptoms and signs of raised ICP are 
headache, vomiting, papilledema, bradycardia, 
hypertension, Cheynes-Stokes respiration, 
yawning and hiccuping. 
Herniation Syndromes 
There are two herniation syndromes-uncal 
and transtentorial-which can rapidly cause 
irreversible brain-stem damage if untreated at an 
early stage. A third type infra ten to rial herniation 
is not common. 
1.Uncal herniation: This results from an
expanding intracranial lesion in the
temporal lobe or lateral cranial vault. Uncus
and the hippocampal gyrus compresses the
adjacent midbrain the oculomotor nerve
and the posterior cerebral artery. Initially

there is ipsilateral pupillary dilatation with 
contralateral hemiplegia. Later, there is 
decorticate and decerebrate posturing 
and loss of ocular reflexes. As the pons is 
compressed, the corneal reflex is lost and 
when medulla is involved there may be 
apnea, hypotension and cardiac arrest. 
2.Transtentorial or central herniation: This is
associated with lesions in frontal, parietal or
temporallobes. Diencephalon or midbrain
is displaced. The signs are given in the table.
3.Infratentorial: The signs and symptoms
are due to herniation of the cerebellum
and mesencephalon upward through the
transtentorial notch, obstructing CSF and
venous return or a downward herniation
through the foramen magnum causing fatal
cardio-respiratory failure.
Causes of Coma 
I. 
368 Coma is a late development of diseases, 
the nature of which is suggested by other 
symptoms: 
l.Severe systemic infections: Septicemia,
typhoid, cholera, pneumonia, malaria,
Weil's disease
2. Infections of nervous system: Meningitis,
encephalitis, cerebral abscess, G PI,
trypanosomiasis
3.Cerebral tumorsPRACTICAL MEDICINE 
4.Metabolic: Diabetes, hypoglycemia, uremia,
hepatic encephalopathy, electrolyte disturb­
ances, Addison's disease, hypothyroidism,
hypothermia.
5.Toxic: Arsenic, lead, milk alkali syndrome,
drugs.
6.Cerebral anemia: Cardiac failure, hypo­
tension, hypoxia, etc.
II.Coma comes early and is the most prominent
feature of the illness:
A.Supratentorial
1.Extracerebral:
a.Head injury: Concussion,
confusion, epidural or subdural
hematoma
b.Subarachnoid hemorrhage
c.Meningitis
2.Intracerebral
a.Cerebro-vascular accidents:
thrombosis, embolism,
hemorrhage, venous thrombo­
phlebitis
b. Encephalitis
c. SOL: Neoplasm, abscess
d.Pituitary apoplexy
B.Subtentorial
1.Pontine, midbrain or cerebellar
hemorrhage.
2.Basilar artery occlusion
C.Cardiac: Stokes-Adams syndrome, hyper-
tensive encephalopathy.
D.Post-epileptic
E.Metabolic: As above
F.Toxic: Barbiturates, alcohol, opium, heroin,
kerosene etc.
G.Miscellaneous: Heat stroke, Caisson's
disease, extreme cold
Mechanism 
1.Supratentori allesions: These produce alteration
in consciousness through the herniation
syndromes. In intracerebral lesions local or
generalized hemispheric deficits occur before
the onset of coma.

{ 6 > Central Nervous System 
In extracerebral lesions altered consciousness 
may be the earliest manifestation. 
2.Subtentorial lesions: Coma can occur with
intrinsic brainstem lesions like cerebrovascular
accident by destruction of ARAS. Extrinsic
lesions cause compression either by the neuronal
tissue damage or through herniation syndrome
leading to asymmetrical motor signs, cranial
nerve palsies, and vomiting.
3.Extra-cranial disorders: Normal brain
requires oxygen and glucose for its metabolism.
Only 2 gm of glucose exists as reserve in
brain. Cerebral cortex and hippocampus are
most sensitive to glucose depletion. Thiamine
and pyridoxine are required for glucose
metabolism 3.3 cc of oxygen per 100 gm
brain tissue per min is required for normal
metabolism in brain. Mental changes occur
when less than 2.5 cc of oxygen per 100 gm.
brain tissue per minute is available and coma
occurs when it falls to 0.2 cc.
The characteristic features of endogenous
disorders leading to coma are:
a.Decreasing level of consciousness precedes
motor signs.
b.Motor abnormalities: There are three types
of motor abnormalities.
i.Tremors -Coarse and irregular.
ii.Asterixis -sudden asynchronous
palmar flapping at the wrist which
are absent at rest and maximum
with sustained posture. These occur
probably because of the electrical
lapses in the controlling muscles.
iii.Multifocal myoclonus -Unpatterned
movements of the facial and proximal
muscles of the limbs.
Treatment 
I.Management of the unconscious patient:
l.Respiration: A clear airway must be
maintained so that oxygenation of blood
and brain do not suffer. This is done by
pulling the tongue forward and doing throat
suction as often as required. Humidified
oxygen may be administered if hypoxia issuspected. If there is respiratory depression, 
stimulants like nikethamide (Coramine) 
may be given round the clock. Endo tracheal 
intubation may be required if secretions 
cannot be adequately removed and if this 
is required for more than 48-72 hours, 
tracheostomy may be required. 
2.Circulation: Patients with raised intracranial
tension are usually hypertensives.
Sometimes, the patient may be unconscious
and in shock. He must be adequately
hydrated with intravenous fluids. If
hypotension persists after adequate
hydration, venous cutdown and a CVP
(central venous pressure) line must be
maintained. If it is normal or high in
presence of hypotension, vasopressors
like mephentermine or dopamine
hydrochloride may be given.
3.Nutrition: An unconscious patient can be
adequately nourished orally through the
Ryle's tube. Whilst feeding, the patient
must be propped up, either by raising the
head end of the bed or using 2-3 pillows,
to prevent aspiration. Daily 2000-2500
ml of fluids and about 1500-2000 calories
are given with combination of milk, fruit
juices, vegetable soups, rice kanji, aerated
waters and sugar. In uremia, fruit juices
and coconut which contain large amounts
of potassium are restricted unless urine
output is adequate and serum electrolytes
do not show hyperkalemia. Similarly milk
is also restricted in uremia.
4.Oral cavity: The mouth must be regularly
cleaned especially with glycerine borax
preferably 2-3 times a day. Oral infections
and parotitis are very common if this care
is neglected. Secretions, if any, must be
regularly sucked with the help of suction
machine.
5.Urinary care: The patient 
usually passes
urine in bed which would require repeated
changing of bedsheets. If this is not done,
bedsores and infections occur. Hence, in a
male patient a condom catheter is passed
which would prevent bed soiling. However,
369 

370 this is not possible in females. Again in some 
unconscious patients there is retention of 
urine. In such cases, a self retaining Foley's 
catheter is put. Once a patient is put on a 
self retaining catheter, various measures to 
prevent and treat urinary tract infection are 
undertaken as follows: 
a.Catheter dressing must be done daily.
b. Bladder washes may be given if there
is pyuria.
c.Bladder exercises must be given after
a few days to prevent loss of tone
of bladder muscles by periodically
clamping the catheter for few hours.
d.Urine must be sent regularly for
routine and culture examination. If
urinary infection is present, urinary
antibiotic syrup like co-trimoxazole,
nitrofurantoin, chloram-phenicol
or ampicillin may be given through
the Ryle's tube. Injectable gentamicin
may be required for Pseudomonas
infection.
6.Bowel: Comatose patients are often
constipated. This can be prevented or
treated by regular simple or saline enemas
on alternate days. Ifthe patient has diarrhea,
it must be promptly controlled with binding
mixtures, metronidazole, antibiotics
or antimotility agents like loperamide.
Bedsores develop rapidly if patient remains
dirty in fecal matter. Nursing care to keep
perianal and genital region clean is of
utmost importance.
7.Skin: The bed must be regularly made.
Bedsheets must be dry and whilst preparing
the bed, creases should be avoided. If the
bed is wet, skin may become sodden and
later bedsores develop. To prevent this,
the patient must be regularly turned and
kept on each side alternately and sometime
prone. Special care must be taken of the
pressure points. Alcohol and spirit must
be used to clean the skin. This is followed
by liberal powdering.
In spite of good care of skin, however, if the PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
bedsore does develop, it must be dressed 
regularly with hydrogen peroxide and 
antibiotic dressings must be applied. The 
affected part must be kept free from pressure. 
8.Eyes: If the eyes of the comatose patient
remains open, exposure keratitis and
ulcerations may occur which can be
prevented by putting antibiotic eyedrops
in the daytime and ointment at night. The
eyes must be closed and if required padded
and bandaged.
If the eyes remain closed, the chance of
exposure keratitis is not present but even
then the eyes must be cleaned 3-4 times
with plain clean water.
9.Passive physiotherapy: An immobile patient
often develops stiff joints. To prevent this,
the limbs must be regularly moved at all
joints for a few times through its complete
range. This may be repeated 2-3 times a day. 
II.Removal of the cause: Removal of the cause is
most important in therapeutics. They may not
be often obvious. However, if it is obvious and
treatable it must be treated. A few examples are
as follows:
1.Gastric lavage, analeptics and naloxone for
narcotic poisons.
2.Atropine and oximes for organo
phosphorous poisoning.
3.Forced alkaline diuresis for barbiturate
poisoning.
4.Ice-baths in heat stroke.
5.Removalofthepatientfromtheco ntaminated 
atmosphere and administration of oxygen
and carbon dioxide in carbon monoxide
poisoning.
14 > Syphilis of Nervous 
Srstem ----
Syphilis usually affects the nervous system in the 
tertiary stage. However, it may show affection even 
in the secondary stage. 
Neurosyphilis usually occurs 10-30 years after the 
primary infection, hence it is more common between 
the age of 30 and 60 years. 

( 6 ) Central Nervous System 
Males are affected more than females. 
Neurosyphillis is rare but with the epidemic of HIV, 
its incidence is increasing.

General Paralysis of Insane (GPI) 
Site of Lesion: Diffuse involvement of the cerebral 
cortex 
Clinical Features 
I.Mental Changes: These are the earliest symptoms
and the earliest change is usually impairment of
intellectual efficiency. There is loss of power to
concentrate, impairment of judgment, memory
defects }ability of mood leading to imbecility.
This is the simply dementic form.
In the grandiose type there is a sense of euphoria
and delusions of grandeur.
The other emotional states commonly seen are
mania, 
depression, paranoid and schizophrenia.In the terminal stages there may be incontinence 
of urine and stools and the patient may become 
bedridden. 
II.Disturbance of Speech and Writing: Usually the
patient has slurred speech. Grammar is affected
due to mental changes. Words and sentences
may be wrongly used or omitted. There may be
nominal aphasia and echolalia. Patient may be
unable to write in a straight line and there may
be micrographia. The writing often depicts the
mental state of the person. Spasticity and tremors
also affect the writing.
III.Progressive Spastic Paraplegia: There is gradual
onset of weakness of both lower limbs due to
involvement of the motor cortex.
IV.Disturbance in Reflexes: Due to spastic paraplegia,
there is loss of abdominal reflex, brisk ankle and
knee jerks and extensor plantar reflex.
V.Disturbance in Pupils: The patient may have small,
unequal or irregular pupils. There may be Argyll
Robertson or reverse Argyll Robertson pupils.
VI.Tremors: Tremors in GPI are conspicuous on
voluntary movements. They are coarse tremors
best seen in the facial muscles, especially lips
and tongue, and in the outstretched hand.
VII.Congestive Attacks of GPI: Also called
apoplectiform episodes, these are characterized
by sudden focal neurological deficit. Hemiplegia
is the commonest. There may be hemianopia,
aphasia, apraxia, monoplegia, paraplegia or
quadriplegia. There may also be transient loss
of consciousness.
Recovery is usually complete within a week. 
CSF Picture: Increased proteins with moderate pleo­
cytosis: 15-100 cells. Colloidal gold curve is paretic. 
CSF VDRL is positive. 
Treatment 
I.Penicillin: Benzathine penicillin 2.4 mega units
intramuscular, per week for 4 weeks. It may be
repeated after 4 to 6 months.
II.Convulsive shock therapy for psychiatric
symptoms.
III.Fever or malarial therapy used commonly in the
past, and for some resistant cases in the recent
past is no longer advocated.
371 

Tabes Dorsalis 
Site of Lesion: Nerve root distal to the posterior root 
ganglion which may be followed by ascending degen­
eration of the posterior columns. 
Clinical Features 
I.Subjective Sensory Disturbances: The patient
may complain of one or more of the following:
A.Lightening pains: These are pains which
come suddenly and go suddenly, like
lightening, and at different sites during
each episode. These occur classically in
tabes dorsalis.
B.Fixed pains: These pains are dull aching
and constant at a particular site.
C.Root pains: These are root pains in the
lower thoracic i.e. in the girdle area.
D.Girdle pains: These are root pains in the
lower thoracic i.e. in the girdle area.
E.Pains of tabetic crisis: Paroxysmal painful
disorder of the function of various viscera
e.g. gastric, rectal, nasal, laryngeal, renal,
urethral, etc.
F.Patient may have the feeling of walking on
cotton wool due to affection of the posterior
columns.
II.Objective Sensory Loss:
A.There is loss of position and vibration sense
almost always involving the lower limbs
and sometimes involving the upper limbs
due to affection of posterior column.
B.Pain, temperature and touch are affected
late. The common area of affection are -
butterfly area of the face, inner side of the
arms, saddle shaped area around the anus
and over tendo Achillis (Abadie's sign).
C.Loss of testicular sense.
III.Hypotonia: Being a lower motor neurone disease
due to affection of the nerve root distal to the
posterior root ganglion, there is hypotonia.
IV.Ataxia: Due to the posterior column affection
there is loss of position and vibration sense which
leads to sensory ataxia. Hence the Romberg's
sign is positive.
V.Disturbance In Reflexes: The deep reflexes are lost
especially the ankle and knee jerks which must
372 PRACTICAL MEDICIN E 
always be lost in a case of tabes dorsalis. Plantar 
response is flexor, unless there is associated GPI 
(Taboparesis) when it may be extensor. 
VI.Disturbance In Pupils: Same as in GPI
VII.Attitude and GAIT:
A.The patient stands on a wide base with eyes
fixed to the ground.
B.When he wishes to walk, due to hypotonia
the limb is lifted to a greater extent
than normal and because the position
sense is affected, it is brought down with
a stamp (high stamping gait).
VIII.Sphincter Disturbances:
A.Impotence is sometimes an early symptom.
B.There may be incontinence of urine and
feces.
C.The classical disturbance is a loss ofbladder
sense. Hence the bladder accumulates urine
with the patient unaware. This gives a false
impression of retention of urine. However,
in tabes dorsalis the patient can voluntarily
evacuate his bladder.
IX.Trophic Changes:
A.Perforating ulcers occur usually on the pad
of the great toe.
B.Charcot's joints: Painless swelling of the
knee joints.
X.Crisis: As described in sensory disturbances
above.
CSP Picture: The proteins may be raised,
especially gamma globulins. There may be
mononuclear cells, usuallynotmorethan 100/c.c.
Colloidal gold curve is tabetic or luetic.

irrespective of the sense of fullness. If there
is dribbling, the patient must be advised to
carry a portable receptacle.
5.Charcot's joints: Rest, physiotherapy and
arthrodesis
Primary Optic Atrophy 
Primary optic atrophy is characterized by: 
I.Chalky white disc
II.Clear cut margins
III.Normal arteries and veins
IV.No exudates or hemorrhages
The patient may come with blindness and his fundus
may show the above changes and therefore syphilis has
to be considered in the differential diagnosis.
Meningovascular Syphilis 
Due to the affection of meninges and vessels, various 
parts of the CNS can be affected. Hence meningo­
vascular syphilis is classified as cerebral and spinal. 
I.Cerebral Syndromes
A.Cerebral thrombosis: Patient presents like
a typical cerebrovascular accident and his
CSF and blood VDRL is positive.
B.Vertical meningitis: There is involvement
of the part of the cerebrum over the vertex.
Hence there is:
l.Pain and tenderness over the vertex.
2.Focal neurological deficits e.g.
hemiplegia, aphasia, etc.
C.Gummatous basal meningitis: There is
affection at the base of the skull where there
are cranial nerves and hence the patient
presents with multiple cranial nerve palsies.

limbs and lower motor neurone type of
paralysis in the upper limbs. This remains

E.Amyotrophy: This resembles progressive
muscular atrophy.
F.Caries of spine: This resembles TB spine.
G.Radiculitis: This resembles neuralgic
amyotrophy.

1 > Cardiac Arrest 
Cardiac arrest is a sudden stoppage of the heart result­
ing in an inadequate cerebral circulation which leads 
to coma within one minute, but recovery would be 
complete if hypoxia is relieved within 3 minutes. If 
hypoxia exceeds 4-5 minutes severe and permanent 
brain damage occurs. Immediately call for help. 
Management 
I.Basic Life Support/ Basic Cardiac Life
Support (BCLS)
The airway, breathing and circulation are
maintained simultaneously as rapidly as possible
as follows:
A.Airway: The airway must be patent. If
foreign body is suspected, the patient must
be rolled on one side and 4-5 forceful blows
must be delivered rapidly between the
shoulder blades with the heel of the hand.
The patient is then put in supine position
and abdominal thrusts in an upward
direction are given to the patient just below
thexiphisternum. Presence of foreign body
can be checked in the pharynx by sweeping
deeply across the posterior pharynx with
the index finger.
After the foreign body is excluded, the
patient should be kept in supine position
as he may require external cardiac massage
and artificial respiration. The patient's head
must be lifted with one hand under the neck
and the other hand pressing the forehead
so that the head is tilted backwards to keep
the upper airway patent
B.Breathing: Once the airway patencyis maintained and if the breathing is 
inadequate, artificial ventilation must 
be given. With the above position, the 
patient's nostrils must be sealed with thumb 
and index finger and mouth-to-mouth 
respiration must be given to the patient. 
This is done by taking a deep inspiration and 
exhaling in the patient's mouth and then 
the patient is allowed to exhale passively. 
This procedure is continued at the rate of 
16-18/min. In hospitals, an Ambu bag is
used.
C.Circulation: With the patient in supine
position, neck extended and legs elevated,
a sudden sharp thrust is given on the chest
wall. This may restore the effective beating
of the heart especially if the cardiac arrest
is due to cardiac standstill. In absence of
response, external cardiac massage is given.
External cardiac massage: The heel of both
the hands, one above the other, the arms
straight and extended and in the kneeling
position, the lower sternum of the patient is
compressed firmly to depress it for at least 4-5
cm.for about half a second. This is carried
out with a rocking movement, regularly and
rhythmically at the rate ofabout 60/min. This
aids cardiac emptying and perfusion of the
vital organs.
II.Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS)
Once the basic life support is maintained an
ECG must be taken to determine whether the 
cause of cardiac arrest is ventricular asystole or 
ventricular fibrillation.

cardiac pacemaker are made available, the 
following drugs are given: 
1.Epinephrine (Adrenaline): 1 ml
of 1: 1000 epinephrine is given
intravenous followed by a bolus of
dextrose. Epinephrine may restart
the heart if cardiac arrest is due
to _ventricular asystole. In case of
ventricular fibrillation epinephrine
makes the heart more amenable
to electrical therapy. It makes the
myocardium more responsive
and crude ventricular fibrillation
is converted to fine ventricular
fibrillation.i Fig. 7.4: External Cardiac Massage ------�-----�----·--------
2.Calcium: 10 ml calcium gluconate
10% is injected I.V. or sometimes
intra-cardiac. It improves the
contractility of the heart and hence
is given to patients requiring repeated
epinephrine injection. It is rarely used.
3.Sodium bicarbonate: 10 ml of 7.5%
sodium bicarbonate is infused slowly
intravenously to correct metabolic
acidosis. Calcium should not be
mixed with sodium bicarbonate in
the drip as a precipitate of calcium
carbonate occurs. This is also rarely
used.
4.Vasopressors: Nor-epinephrine 1: 1000
is initially given in the dose of 2 ml
and later repeated if hypotension
persists. Dopamine may be given in
the dose of 100 mcg/ml (by adding
50 mg of dopamine in 500 ml of
saline) intravenously slowly. The rate
of the drip is adjusted according to
the response. Low dose dopamine or
dobutamine is the drug of choice.
B.Ifit is ventricular fibrillation the following
drugs are used in addition:
1.Lignocaine: 50-100 mg is injected
intravenously as a bolus and may be
repeated after 15-20 min. It raises the
fibrillation threshold and prevents the
recurrence of ventricular fibrillation.
2.Propranolol 5-10 mg may be given
intravenously as an antiarrhythmic

agent. Newer ultrashort -acting 
betablockers like esmolol are now 
being used. 
Bretylium tosylate 5-IOmg/kgl.V. may 
be given. It increases the efficacy of 
DC shock. 
4.Adenosine is used for SVT.
III.Specific measures
A.For ventricular asystole: If cardiac arrest
persists in spite of the above measures,
external cardiac pacing is done. If this is
negative or required for a long period,
internal cardiac pacemaker is inserted.
B.For ventricular fibrillation: If the above
drugs do not immediately revert the cardiac
rhythm or if ventricular fibrillation is
recurrent inspite of the above measures a
Direct Current (DC) shock is given to the
heart with 200 joules. It should be repeated
if required after a few minutes with 300
Joules and then up to 400 Joules.
Recurrent ventricular fibrillation can be
prevented by the use ofIV Lignocainein a drip 
of 500 ml of glucose. Alternatively, Bretylium,
Quinine or Procainamide can be given IM.
Resistant ventricular fibrillation may be 
due to hyperkalemia and hypomagnesemia.
Hence these electrolyte abnormalities
should be corrected with glucose-insulin
drip and 10-20 ml ofKCl or 10-15 ml of
20% magnesium sulfate IV respectively. If 
these measures also fail, open-chest cardiac
resuscitation should be done.
IV.Management After Successful Resuscitation
but Unconscious Patient
1.Endotracheal Intubation with controlled
ventilation should be continued with the
help of a ventilator to keep the p02 at 100
mm Hg and pC02 at 30-40 mm Hg.
2.Blood pressure must be maintained at 100
mm Hg systolic, if required with the help
of vasopressors like dopamine.
3.Acid-base and fluid electrolyte balance
should be maintained.

< 7 ) Medical Emergencies 
4.Mannitol 350-500 ml l.V. ordexamethasone
4 mg 6-8 hourly I. V. should be given if there
is cerebral edema.
5.Phenytoin sodium, diazepam or pheno­
barbitone should be given if there are
convulsions.
6.Aspiration pneumonia should be prevented
by appropriate antibiotics.
If the patient 
recovers consciousness within 
12 hours, there is a good chance for complete 
neurological recovery. If after 12 hours, pupils 
are fixed, corneal reflexes absent and deep tendon 
reflexes also absent, prognosis is poor. 
Termination of Cardiopulmonary 
Resuscitation 
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be continued 
till there is cerebral death. Cerebral death is presumed 
if deep coma, absent spontaneous respiration and heart 
beat and fixed dilated pupils persists for more than 
20 mins. EEG would be flat in case of cerebral death.

3 > lschemic Heart Disease 
Acute Coronary Syndrome I Acute 
Myocardial Infarction I Unstable Angina 
(Refer Ch. 5) 
4 > Stokes Adams S ndrome 
Stokes Adams syndrome is a transient syncope or 
unconsciousness due to cerebral ischemia because of 
poor or absent ventricular output. 
Management 
1.Immediate measures: Immediate measures must
be taken to resuscitate the heart. A sharp blow
over the precordium may be enough to start it.
External cardiac massage with mouth-to-mouth
respiration may be required.
2.Ifthe ECG shows ventricular fibrillation, external3. electric shock with a DC defibrillator may start 
the heartbeat. 
Temporary pacemaker should be introduced 
and external pacing should be done till a 
permanent pacemaker is inserted. 
4.Drugs: Till the pacemaker is inserted, in case of
ventricular asystole the following can be given:
a.Isoprenaline: 0.1-0.4 mg injected intra­
venously directly or 1 mg in a drip of 200
ml of 5% glucose.
b. Ephedrine or epinephrine: 0.2-0.5 ml of
1: 1000 solution can be given intracardiac,
intra-venously or intramuscularly.
c.Sodium bicarbonate: 100 ml of7.5% solution
may be given intravenously to combat
acidosis.
d.Steroids: Injection hydrocortisone 100
mg intravenously may be given to relieve
edema, if any, around the AV node.
e.Hydrochlorothiazi de, sodium lactate,
atropine and aminophylline can be used.
5 > H1-eertensive Crisis 
Refer to JN C VII criteria for hypertensive urgency and 
emergency (Refer Pg. 48). 
Management 
I.The patient must be preferably hospitalized and
given complete bed rest and tranquilizers like
diazepam 5-10 mg or alprazolam 0.25 mg three
times a day. 
II. Anti-hypertensive drugs
l.Nifedipine: In a hypertensive cns1s,
nifedipine (5-10 mg) capsule can be cut to
allow the liquid to come out. It is absorbed
sublingually and lowers the BP in 15-20
min. The effect lasts for 3-6 hours. It can
be repeated every 5-10 min up to 60 mg/
day. Sudden lowering ofBP may precipitate
stroke and therefore must be avoided.
2. Sodium nitroprusside: It causes vascular
smooth muscle relaxation equally affecting
both the arterioles and venules resulting in
decreased peripheral resistance and venous
377 

378 tone. Thus, it reduces both the preload and 
afterload resulting in reduced myocardial 
oxygen consumption. It is given as 50 
mg dissolved in 500 ml of dextrose ( 100 
mcg/ml) and given in the dose of20 mcg/ 
min. It has to be protected from light as 
it can decompose to toxic thiocyanate on 
exposure to light. The anti-hypertensive 
effect appears in 30 sec and lasts for 
only 2 minutes after stopping the drip. 
It thus produces a smooth lowering of 
blood pressure and is thus useful in acute 
myocardial infarction and low cardiac 
output states. 
3.Nitroglycerine: It is given in the dose of 5-10
mg/min IV It is a venodilator which acts
within 2-5 min.
4.Esmolol: It is a short-acting beta-blocker.
It is given in the dose of 500 mg/kg/min
for 4 min and then 150-300 mg/kg/min.
5.Nicardipine: Causes vasodilation in the dose
of 5-10 mg/hr IV after about 10 min.
6.Labetalol: It is an alpha as well as beta­
blocker given as 20-80 mg IV every 10 min.
7.Enalapril: It is given in the dose of 2.5
-5 mg IV 6 hourly. It acts in about 10-15
min.
8.Diazoxide: It directly acts on the arterioles
and dilates them. It is given in the dose
of 5 mg (250-300 mg) over 1-5 minutes
slowly intravenous ly. There is a rapid
lowering ofblood pressure over 1-3 mins
and the effect lasts for about 24 hours.
It causes sodium retention. Hence it has
to be combined with 40 mg furosemide.
Since there is a precipitous fall in BP,
it is contra-indi cated in coronary
and cerebral vascular diseases. It also
causes hyperglycemia and hence is also
contraindicated in diabetes mellitus.
9.Hydralazine: It is given in the dose of 30-40
mg intramuscularly every 8 hourly. It is a
peripheral vasodilator.
10.Phentolamine: It is very useful in
hypertensive crisis due to pheochromo-PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
cytoma. It is given in the dose of 5-15 mg 
IV.It acts within 1-2 min.
III.Treatment of the cause whenever possible:
e.g. surgical removal of tumor in pheochromo­
cytoma.
6 > Hypertensive 
Encephalopathy ------
Hypertensive encephalopathy is acute transient 
cerebral dysfunction associated with a rapid rise of 
diastolic blood pressure due to constriction of the 
central arterioles leading to cerebral edema and clini­
cally characterized by headache, vomiting, convulsions, 
unconsciousness and focal neurological deficits like 
hemiplegia, blindness, aphasia, etc, in an hypertensive 
patient. 
Management 
I.Anticonvulsants:
1.Diazepam: Diazepam lOmgshouldbegiven
intravenously. It can be repeated after 10 
min. till convulsions stop.
2.Phenytoin: Loading dose of phenytoin
sodium is given, followed by maintenance
dose.
3.Barbiturates: Phenobarbitone 100-200
mg. intramuscularly or diluted in 50 ml
of saline, intravenously over 10 mins. Now
rarely used.
4.Diazepam and barbiturates may cause
serious hypo-tension and respiratory
failure if given intravenously. Paraldehyde
5 ml intra-muscular is another useful drug
to control convulsions.
II.Antihypertensive drugs:
1.Nifedipine: See hypertensive crisis.
2.Diazoxide: See hypertensive crisis.
3.Sodium nitroprusside: See hypertensive
crisis.
4.Chlorpromazine: It has antihypertensive,
anti-emetic and tranquilizing effects. It is
useful in toxemia of pregnancy. It is given
as 50-100 mg intramuscularly or slowly
intravenously 2.5 mg every 2-5 mins till
the blood pressure falls.

{ 7 > Medical Emergencies 
5.Magnesium sulphate IV is also useful in
toxemia of pregnancy and is drug of choice.
III.Measures to reduce raised intracranial tension:
Mannitol 350 ml and furosemide 40 mg
intravenously with glycerol orally is helpful.
IV.Management of unconscious patient.
V.Treatment of the cause.
7 > Shock 
Shock is a state of inadequate tissue perfusion of the 
vital organs like brain, liver, kidneys etc. due to a 
reduction in the cardiac output. 
Management 
I.Emergency Management: The following
measures should be carried out in all patients
with shock because if promptly treated, shock
is initially reversible.
1.Head-low position: The patient must be
given head low position to increase the
filling pressure of the right ventricle and
raise the cardiac output.
2.Respiration: A clear airway must be
ensured either by pulling the tongue out
or by keeping a metal airway. If required
endotracheal intubation may be carried
out to ensure adequate ventilation. High
concentration of oxygen should be given.
3.Fluids: An intravenous drip should be
started using a large bore needle. The
IV fluid used depends upon the type
of shock. In hemorrhagic shock-blood
transfusions, in burns-plasma or saline
and in cardiogenic shock-dextran is given.
Transfusion of fluids should be slowed
down when central venous pressure is about
5 cm above the sternal angle.
4.Acid-base balance: Metabolic acidosis which 
accompanies shock should be treated with
50-100 cc. of7.5% sodium bicarbonate. The
dose of sodium bicarbonate may have to be
repeated till acidosis is corrected because
acidosis may depress the myocardial
contractibility and cause resistance to the
action of catecholamines.II.Specific treatment
1.Vasopressors and inotropes are useful
because they have a positive inotropic effect
(increaseincontractilityofthem yocardium)
and peripheral vasoconstricting action.
They are useful in cardiogenic shock due
to myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
Usually there is hypotension and raised
CVP. However, it is important to ensure
adequate blood volume (central venous
pressure more than 5 cm) before using
these drugs, otherwise the peripheral
vasoconstrictive effect may further reduce
the circulation to the vital organs. The
commonly used drugs are:-
a.Dopamine: 500 mcg in 500 ml of
dextrose is given slowly through a
microdrip to ensure 5-15 µg/kg/min.
The dose has to be adjusted depending
upon blood pressure. This is especially
useful in cardiogenic shock.
It affects both p1 and a -receptors
with a predominance of beta effect. It
therefore causes an increase in cardiac
output and in blood pressure.
b.Dobutamine: It is given in the dose
of 2-30 µg/kg/min IV. It acts on
beta-receptors and improves cardiac
output. However, blood-pressure
may not rise and in fact may fall.
The combined use of dobutamine
and dopamine produces greater
increases in arterial pressure and
cardiac output than either agent
alone.
c.Nor-epinephrine: 2-4 mg in 500 ml.
of dextrose, adjusted to administer
20-30 drops/min. Usually 1-25 µg/
min is required. Now rarely used.
d.Mephentermine: 30-60 mg given IM
or in a 5% glucose drip till the blood
pressure is maintained. Now rarely
used.
e.Epinephrine (for anaphylactic shock),
dopexamine, amrinone and milrinone
can also be used.
2.Corticosteroids: 100-500 mg. of hydro­
cortisone hemisuccinate is often given
379 

immediately intravenously. It is especially 
useful in anaphylactic, cardiogenic, septic 
shock, neurogenic shock and adrenal crisis. 
3.Antibiotics: Antibiotics like gentamicin,
1-1.5 mg/kg IV as loading dose plus third
generation cephalosporins like ceftazidime
1 gm 4-6 hourly and metronidazole 500mg 8
hourlyare used in gram negative septicemia.
Cloxacillin, nafcillin or oxacillin are useful
if staphylococcal infection is present. If
the source of sepsis is not identified or the
patient is neutropenic, broad-spectrum
coverage with an aminoglycoside (loading
IV dose of gentamycin 1.0-1.5 mg/kg or
tobramycin) and a semisynthetic penicillin
or cephalo-sporin can be used.
4.Miscellaneous:
a.Chlorpromazine: 25-30 mg has been
found useful in septic shock. It acts
by alpha-adrenergic action on the
arterioles resulting in diminished
pooling of the blood in the periphery .
b. Heparin: This may prevent
intravascular clotting in septic shock.
Heparin 2000-5000 units are given
every 6 hourly.
c.Intra Aortic Balloon Counterpulsation
(IABP) is useful in cardiogenic
shock. It reduces left ventricular
diastolic volume by reduction of
aortic impedance in end-diastole
and it increases systemic, cerebral
and coronary perfusion pressures in
early diastole. Pulmonary congestion
is reduced and myocardial pump
performance and oxygenation
improves.
8 > Anaph}'lactic Shock 
Anaphylactic shock is a relatively uncommon emer­
gencywhich requires prompt and vigorous treatment. 
Management 
1.Epinephrine: 0.5-1.0 mlofl:1000 epinephrine is
given SC or IV and repeated every 15 min. until
improvement. Its alpha adrenoceptor agonist
380 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
activity causes peripheral vaso-constriction 
whereas its beta-adrenoceptor agonist activity is 
useful as a bronchodilator. It also imparts further 
release of chemical mediators concerned in the 
pathogenesis of the reaction. 
2.Histamine (HI) antagonists: 10-20 mg
chlorpheniramine may be given slowly
intravenously and repeated if required for 24
hours. It counteracts the effects of histamine,
which is one of the most important mediators
concerned in anaphylaxis and correlates well
with the degree ofhypotension. It is particularly
effective in the management of angioedema,
pruritus and urticaria.
3.Corticosteroids: 200 mg of hydrocortisone
hemisuccinate may be given intravenously but it
has little place in the immediate management of 
anaphylaxis since its beneficial effects are delayed 
for several hours. However, early administration
may help prevent deterioration after the primary
treatment has been given.
4.Volume replacement: It is required in patients
with circulatory collapse. Intravenous fluids
should be given and monitored by central
venous pressure line. Large volumes of electrolyte
solutions may be necessary because plasma loss
may be very high in severe anaphylaxis. Colloid
solutions like plasma protein fraction or dextran
are preferable.
5.Miscellaneous:
a.Bronchodilators: Aminophylline, salbu­
tamol or terbutaline may be given for
bronchospasm.
b.Oxygen with assisted ventilation.
c.Emergency tracheostomy for laryngeal
edema or respiratory obstruction.
9 > Pulmonary Embolism & 
Deep Vein Thrombosis 
Pulmonary embolism (PE) is blockage of the pulmo­
nary vasculature by blood clots, venous thrombi, fat, 
air, foreign bodies or fragments of malignant tumors. 
The majority of PEs arise from deep vein thrombosis 
(DVT) of the iliofemoral system. 

< 7 > Medical Emergencies 
Investigations 
1.Baseline CBC and coagulation studies and for
hypercoagulable state -factor V Leiden and
lupus anticoagulant/anticardiolipin antibody
are carried out immediately. Protein C, Sand
antithrombin III should be tested 4-6 weeks
after discontinuation of oral anticoagulants.
2.Guaiac test for stool occult blood should be
negative and there should be no other risks for
bleeding (tumor, bleeding diathesis, etc).
3.Ventilation-perfusion (V!Q) lung scan and
pulmonary angiography are useful for PE.
4.LE duplex doppler study is important. ECHO and 
venogram can be done.
Management 
I.Medical
1.Relief of pain: Severe pain can be relieved
by opiates like injection pethidine 100 mg
IV or morphine 15 mg IV.
2.Heparins: Bolus 80-150 units/kg heparin
(unless contra-indications) is followed by
IV 15-18 units/kg/ !hr titrated individually
so that aPTT is two times therapeutic
range (aim for 60-90 secs). The patients'
previous trends and clinical history should
be considered while adjusting dosage.
Heparin is continued for 5-10 days.

Low molecular weight heparins have equal or 
greater antithrombotic effect and should be 
considered in certain clinical situations. 
Platelet count should be done at least QOD 
while on heparin since there is a risk ofheparin­
associated-thrombocytopen ia or thrombosis. 3.Warfarin:
Heparin is simultaneously given with
warfarin until PT /INR (International
Normalised Ratio) is therapeutic for 48 hrs
and then heparin is discontinued. Warfarin
is started at 10 mg po Q HS for 2 days, then
5 mg po for 1 day and adjusted according
to therapeutic goals given below:
Table 7.2 : Therapeutic Goals 
Indication INR 
FirstDVT 2-3 
Second DVT 3-4 
PE 3-4 
Atrial Fibrillation 2-3 
Prosthetic Valve-Tissue 2-3
Prosthetic Valve-Mechanical 2.5-3.5 
Antiphospholipid Antibody 3-4 
It is continued for 3 months or indefinitely 
if risk factors are still present or there is 
recurrent thromboembolism. 
4.Thrombolytic agents: Streptokinase or
urokinase or recombinant tissue plasmino­
gen activator (rt-PA). Streptokinase:
IV bolus 2,50,000 units over 30 mins is
followed by 1,00,000 units/hr IV for 24
hours. The clot usually lyses in 3-5 days. A
venepuncture or venesection is done prior
to the therapy, because if venous puncture
is required after the administration of
streptokinase, uncontrollable bleeding may
occur.
5.Digitalis: Usually digoxin 0.5 mg is rapidly
given IV to increase the output of failing
right ventricle.
6.Vasopressors like Jsoprenaline: This is given
in the dose of 0.5-1.0 mg IV and repeated
if required. It increases the cardiac output
and heart rate in case they are low.
7.Antibiotics: Ampicillin 500 mg 6 hourly
should be given to control infection in case
of pulmonary infarction.
8.Oxygen: This should be given through the
Wolfe's bottle.
381 

II.Surgery: Emergency pulmonary embolectomy
can be done before the clots become fragmented,
disseminated or organized in selective cases.
III.Preventive: Pulmonary embolism or DVT is
often precipitated by various factors, which
should be controlled.
1.Prolonged immobilization in bed should
be avoided especially in the elderly.
2. The posture should be frequently changed.
3.Active and passive movements of the lower
limbs should be carried out.
4.Respiratory exercises should be taught.
5.Dehydration should be prevented and
anemia, obesity and infections treated.
6.Low dose heparin: In critically ill patients
& those in whom it is likely to occur,
heparin 5000 units 12 hourly or LMW
heparin can be given. In this small dose,
heparin reduces the rate of combination
of antithrombin III with activated factor
X and thrombin. This enhances the body's
anti-thrombotic processes and prevents
thrombus formation.
7.IVC Filters can be used to prevent PE in
patients with DVT who cannot be anti­
coagulated or in those with persistent PE
inspite of anticoagulation.
10 > Hemoptis _i_s __ 
Hemoptysis is expectoration of blood. 
TYPES: There are two types of hemoptysis. 
1.True hemoptysis: Hemorrhage from the lungs,
the bronchial tree and trachea.
2.Pseudo hemoptysis: Hemorrhage from the nose,
mouth, pharynx and larynx.
Causes 
I. 
382 True hemoptysis: 
A.Cardiac: Mitra! stenosis, aneurysm of
aorta, left ventricular failure and primary
pulmonary hypertension.
B.Respiratory: Pneumonia, tuberculosis,PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
bronchogenic carcinoma and adenoma, 
pulmonary embolism, lung abscess, 
bronchiectasis and other infections oflung 
and bronchi, trauma to the airways and 
lung and A-V malformations. 
C.Immunological: Goodpasture's syndrome
Wegener's granulomatosis and Polyarteritis
nodosa.
D.Bleeding disorders: Thrombocytopenic
purpura, agranulocytosis, leukemia,
hemophilia and anticoagulant therapy.
E. Iatrogenic: Following bronchoscopy, lung
biopsy, endotracheal intubation and
anticoagulant therapy.
II.Pseudo hemoptysis:
1.Trauma of mouth, pharynx and larynx.
2.Tuberculosis, syphilis orpyogenic infection
of mouth, pharynx and larynx.
3.Malignancy of mouth, pharynx and larynx.
4.Bleeding spongy gums in scurvy.

Usually hemoptysis is scanty and stops spontaneo usly. 
However, since it is an alarming symptom, physicians 
tend to over-treat it. Ifhemoptysis is massive, the fol­
lowing treatment should be given. 
I.Reassurance: Patient must be reassured.
II.Treatment of shock: If there is massive

( 7 ) Medical Emergencies 
hemoptysis and patient is likely to have bled 
profusely, management for shock must be carried 
out in the following way: 
1.Blood must be collected for the estimation
of hemoglobin (Hb ), packed cell volume
(PCV) and grouping and cross matching.
2.Intravenous normal saline must be started.
3.Blood transfusion may be required if Hb
and PCV are falling and tachycardia and
hypotension occur.
4.Head-low position and intermittent oxygen
may be given.
Ill. To Stop Bleeding: 
1.Fogarty Catheter: Massive hemoptysis
is treated with tamponade technique. A
balloon tipped Fogarty catheter is passed
through the bronchoscope and it is inflated
proximal to the bleeding site. The pressure
is maintained for a few hours or even days,
especially if the patient is a poor surgical
risk.
2.Bronchial artery embolisation: Bronchial
artery angiogram is done and the affected
bronchial artery is embolised with
sclerosing liquid. This would stop bleeding.
3.Surgery: The affected bronchial artery can be
tied by a surgical operation or the affected
lung can be removed.
4.Antitussives: Linctus codeine must be
given to suppress cough because coughing
prevents normal clotting after hemorrhage.
5.Posture: The patient should be given bed
rest in a semi-reclining position and
leaning on the elbow of the affected side to
minimize aspiration of blood and spread
to the unaffected bronchi.
IV.Treatment of the cause: The cause ofhemoptysis
-Tuberculosis , aspergillosis, pneumonia or
pulmonary edema should be appropriately
treated.
1.Percutaneous intracavitary infusion of
amphoter icin can be given in cases of
massive hemoptysis due to pulmonary
aspergillosis.
2.Radiotherapy can be utilized to stop massive
uncontrolled hemoptysis from bronchial
carcinoma.V.Prevent Aspiration:
1.Bronchial aspiration may be required
frequently to prevent atelectasis of the
unaffected lung.
2.Endotracheal tube: The functional airway
can be protected by insertion of a special
endotracheal tube with an inflatable cuff
through the main stem bronchus into the
non-bleeding lung.
3.Rigid bronchoscopy: This may be needed in
massive hemoptysis to remove blood clots.
4.Avoid sedatives. 
11 > Bronchial Asthma 
Bronchial asthma consists ofincreased responsiveness 
of bronchial tree, which is characterized by frequent 
attacks of dyspnea due to generalized bronchial con­
striction. 
Management 
I.Acute Bronchial Asthma: Acute attack of
bronchial asthma requires urgent medical
treatment. Following measures should be taken:
l.Oxygen: Hypoxia should be corrected by
oxygen inhalation. Oxygen should be given
intermittently and humidified. Usually
high concentration of oxygen (6-8L/min)
is required as there is no danger of CO2 
retention.
2.Bronchodilation: Bronchospasm can be
treated with one or more of following:
a.Inhaled nebulised beta agonists
High dose ofinhaled beta agonist like
Salbutamol 2.5-5 mg or terbutaline
5-10 mg nebulized through oxygen or
20-50 puffs into a large space devise
should be given and repeated every
4 hours.
b. Intravenous Betaagonists: Salbutamol
200 mg or Terbutaline 200 mg should
be given over 10 min or infusion of
3-20mg/minor Aminophylline 0.25-
383 

0.5 mg. diluted up to 20 ml. with 5% 
glucose intravenously. 
c.Injection Epinephrine 0.5 ml ( 1: 1000)
can be given subcutaneously.
3.Steroids if the attack is severe, intravenous
glucose saline infusion along with 100
mg of soluble hydrocortisone should be
administered. IV methyl prednisolone is
used now as an agent of choice. It should not
be given rapidly as it can cause arrythmias.
4.Hydration: If dehydration is present,
5% glucose saline should be given till
dehydration is corrected.
5.Antibiotics: Penicillin or cephalosporins or
ciprofloxacin or tetracycline may be given
to check respiratory infection.
6.Ipratropium bromide 2.5 mg nebulized and
given 8 hourly may be useful, especially for
smokers.
7.Mechanical Ventilator: This maybe needed if 
the patient develops hypoxia, hypercapnea,
unconsciousness, drowsiness or respiratory
arrest.
8.Bronchoalveolar Lavage: This is useful to
wash act mucus plugs.
9.Follow-up: After acute attack subsides,
steroids must be continued for 6 weeks.
Future management depends on the type
of asthma. Sedatives and vigorous chest
physiotherapy should not be given.
II.Chronic Bronchial Asthma:
384 After an acute attack subsides, the patient may
require long term treatment to prevent relapse.
I.Bronchod ilators: These drugs may be
required to treat bronchospasm. Often long
term treatment is required.
a.Beta-2 stimulants: Salbutamol 2-4 mg
three times a day or terbutaline 2.5-5
mg three times orally are the other
available bronchodilators. The action
is physiological and hence these are
commonly used nowadays.PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
b. Aminophylline: This drug is a
very popular oral bronchodilator.
However, it is erratically absorbed
orally and hence its effect on oral
administration is variable. However,
it is effective rectally.
c.Ephedrine 30 mg in divided doses
three times a day is the oldest and
yet the most effective bronchodilator.
However, it is contraindicated in
cardiac patients.
d.Isoprena line 20 mg sub-lingual
or by inhalation helps to relieve
bronchospasm. It should be avoided
in presence of cardiac diseases. Rarely
used now.
2.Corticosteroids: In few cases when the
above drugs fail to get effective response,
oral prednisolone should be considered. It
should be given in the dose of 5-15 mg daily
for 4-6 weeks and then gradually tapered
off.
3.Atropine compounds: Ipratropium bromide
an atropine derivative decreases the amount
of cyclic guanosine monophosphate
(cGMP) in respiratory muscles and
mast cells by blocking cholinergic input.
Increased levels of cGMP cause mast
cell degranulation and bronchial smooth
muscle contraction.
4.Antibiotics: Doxycycli neortetracyclinewith
or without macrolides like roxithromycin
or azithromycin are used if infection is
present.
5.Allergy: If the responsible allergen is
detected the patient should be put into
an environment free of the allergen. If
skin tests show hypersensitivity to certain
allergens, desensitization should be carried
out by serum administration.
6.Ketotifen: This drug acts by. stabilizing
the mast cell membrane and preventing
the release of intracellular mediators like
histamine, SRS etc. It is given in the dose
of 1 mg three times a day orally for at least
1 month. It is useful in young patients with
extrinsic asthma.

( 7 ) Medical Emergencies 
12 Respiratory Failure 
Respiratory failure is said to exist when partial pres­
sure of oxygen in blood at rest is below 60 mm of Hg 
or that of CO2 is above 45 mm of Hg. 
Management 
I.Maintenance of dear airways: This is one of the
most important points to be borne in mind while
treating the patient with respiratory failure.
1.Supervised coughing in a conscious patient
and changing the patient's position
frequently from side to side may help
clear up the airway. Cough may be limited
by exhaustion, muscular weakness, air
trapping or pain due to rib fracture or
pleurisy.
2.Oral cavity should be cleared of thick
secretions by a rolled gauze piece held in
an artery forceps. Secretions at the back
of the throat or in the trachea should be
removed by frequent suction.
3.Mucolytic agents: Mucolytic agents like
bromhexine orally are helpful to liquefy
secretion. Acetylcysteine 1-2 ml of 20%
solution may be instilled through the
tracheostomy tube (if tracheostomy is
done). This should be immediately followed
by mechanical suction.
4.Bronchoscopic aspiration: If the cough is
ineffective and the airway needs to be
cleared, bronchoscopic aspiration may have
to be repeated once or even twice over the
first few hours.
5.Endotracheal intubation: If the secretions
are reaccumulating rapidly or if aspiration
from the esophagus or upper respiratory
tract seems likely, a cuffed endotracheal
tube may be passed and repeated aspirations
may be carried out.
6.Tracheostomy: Tracheostomy may be a life
saving procedure for some patients but it
has got its own limitations, which must
be considered. It is especially helpful if
the open 
airway has to be maintained for
over 72 hours and when there is profoundrespiratory insufficiency because it reduces 
the physiological dead space. 
II.Bronchodilators: Respiratory failure is often
associated with obstructive airway disease
and obstructive airways worsen an existing
respiratory failure. Bronchodilators help to
oxygenate the airways and subsequently blood.
Various bronchodilators used are as follows:
1.Aminophylline: This is a very potent
bronchodilator. It acts by inhibiting the
phosphodiesterase and thus preventing the
breakdown of cyclic AMP. It is given in the
dose of0.25 gm intravenously diluted in l 0
ml of l 0-25% dextrose and injected slowly.
Alternately it may be given in 500 ml of 5%
glucose with 0.5-1.0 gm of aminophylline
in a drip. It also has a central respiratory
stimulant action.
2.Beta-2 (sympathomimetic) drugs:
Orciprena-line, salbutamol or terbutaline
act synergistically with aminophylline and
achieve maximum bronchodilatation. They
stimulate adenyl cyclase which converts
ATP to 3-5' cyclic AMP. The average dose
required for salbutamol is 8-24 mg and
terbutaline is 10-30 mg in divided doses
orally, IM or IV in a drip. Nebulized
solutions ofSalbutamol 2.5-5 mg 4 hourly
or Terbutaline 5-10 mg may also be given.
3.Corticosteroids: If there is marked
bronchospasm not responding to the above
drugs prednisolone 20-40 mg orally or
dexamethasone 4-16 mg/ day parenterally
may be given.
III.Oxygen therapy: Oxygen is a double-eged
sword and should be used with great caution.
Oxygen therapy is useful because it corrects
hypoxia-one of the major consequences of
respiratory failure. However, in a patient of
chronic obstructive lung disease, hypoxia is the
only stimulus to the respiratory centre because
prolonged hypercapnia decreases the ventilatory
response to carbon dioxide and acidosis.
Administration of oxygen would theoretically
decrease the respiratory stimulus and aggravate
hypercapnia. However, in practice, if continuous
385 

oxygen is given at low flow rates these problems 
are not so common and on the contrary depriving 
a patient in hypoxia of oxygen causes more 
problems. Oxygen must be well humidified and 
administered through nasal catheter or mask. 
IV.Respiratory stimulants may be used when the
patient has impaired consciousness. Usually
Nikethamide (2-4 ml. of a 25% solution IV)
is used but its effect is transient. Vanillic acid
diethylamide (3-24 gm. in 540 ml.) by IV drip
gives a more prolonged respiratory stimulation.
V.Mechanical Ventilation: If adequate respiratory
effort cannot be maintained by endotracheal
intubation and alveolar hypoventilation becomes
a critical factor for survival, the use of assisted
ventilation becomes necessary. Initially this
may be given via a cuffed endotracheal tube
even when the patient is conscious but sedated.
Endotracheal tubes can be tolerated for 48
hours and sometimes even up to a week. Later
tracheostomy may be needed.
VI.Treatment of cause
1.Precipitating factors like smoking or
allergens must be avoided.
2.Patients with industrial disease of lung
causing respiratory failure may benefit by
change of occupation or residence.
3.Diuretics and digitalis are helpful in
pulmonary edema and cor pulmonale.
4.Anticoagulants may be required for
pulmonary embolism.
5.ACTH and corticosteroids are useful in
respiratory centre paralysis in certain
disorders like acute infective polyneuritis
and may have to be given in large doses.
6.Antibiotics may be required if respiratory
inf�ction is the cause or an aggravating
factor.
7.Long-term bronchodilators, salbutamol,
aminophylline, ephedrine or epinephrine
may be required in bronchial asthma.
8.Massive pleural effusion or pneumothorax
may require drainage.
386 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
13 Tension Pneumothorax 
Tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency which 
may result in death if left untreated. The air leaks 
from the lungs into the pleural cavity, but a ball valve 
leak prevents this air from leaving the pleural cavity. 
This results in a marked rise in intrapleural pressure 
which completely collapses the lung, markedly shifts 
the mediastinum to opposite side, prevents cardiac 
filling and results in a fall in cardiac output. 
Management 
1.Emergency insertion of needle: A large bore
needle (17-18 gauge BD needle) first passed
through a sterilized flat piece of rubber or cork
(to form a hilt), is inserted into the second
right intercostal space (if right sided) in the
middavicular line or fifth left intercostal space
(if left sided) in the axillary line, preferably
after local infiltration with 2% procaine
hydrochloride.
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. As soon as the needle enters the pleural space,
air escapes, intrapleural pressure falls and the
patient feels comfortable. As soon as possible
the needle should be connected via a sterilized
rubber tube to an underwater seal, which should
be connected to an electric suction pump that
would provide a negative pressure of 20-30 cm
of water.
Oxygen: Proper administration of humidified
oxygen at a high flow rate of 8-10 liters/min
helps to relieve anoxemia and cyanosis.
Treatment of shock: Lowering of intrapleural
pressure itself relieves shock because ventilation
improves, anoxemia is corrected, venous
return increases and so does cardiac output.
However, if the medullary centres have been
affected by anoxemia, it may take some time to
recover. These patients may require intravenous
fluids, vasopressors like mephentermine and
respiratory stimulants like nikethamide.
For associated hemothorax or pyothorax:
Removal of the respective fluid must be done
through an incision in the lower intercostal
spaces.
Treatment of cause: Tuberculosis if present must
be appropriately treated.

Management 
I.Conservative Treatment
1. Maintenance of adequate blood volume: A
patient with massive bleeding, who is in
shock, requires immediate measures to
rapidly restore blood volume, even before
a proper history is taken or examination
is done. An intravenous drip of dextran,
saline, plasma or glucose is started whilst
waiting for blood. Manyblood transfusions
may be required and should be given.
2.Gastric Lavage: Distension of the stomach
by blood clots prevents an atonic stomach
from arresting bleeding by contraction
of the stomach wall. Hence, a Ryle's tube
must be passed and the stomach 
must be
lavaged with ice-cold water or saline until
the returning fluid is clear and free ofblood
clots. This not only helps to control bleeding
but also minimizes vomiting and helps to
monitor the activity of bleeding.
3.H2-receptor antagonist: IV Ranitidine 50
mg 12 hourly may be helpful in arresting4. 
5. 
6. 
7. 
8. 
9. 
10. bleeding as it inhibits the secretion of acid. 
Once bleeding has stopped and oral feeds 
are started, ranitidine 150 mg or famotidine 
20 mg may be given twice a day orally. 
Antacids: When peptic ulcer is the cause 
of bleeding, aluminium hydroxide or 
magnesium trisilicate are useful and may 
be given. If pains are severe, ice-cold milk 
and antacids may be given as an intragastric 
drip. 
Sucraifate: Sucralfate 1 gm 6 hourly is useful 
in peptic ulcer disease. It coats the ulcer 
and prevents the action of acid on the ulcer, 
thus aiding in healing. 
Proton pump inhibitors: IV Pentaprazole 
or omaprazol can be given. Unlike H2 
blockers, they have no drug interactions. 
Vasoconstrictor drugs: When bleeding is 
due to esophageal varices, pitressin 20 
units diluted in 500 ml. of isotonic saline 
or dextrose is given over 4-6 hours and 
repeated till bleeding stops. The dose is 
gradually tapered over the next 12-24 hours. 
It causes abdominal cramps and should be 
used with ECG control. 
Esophageal tamponade with Sengstaken 
Blakemore tube may be tried in a case 
of variceal bleeding if pitressin drip fails 
to stop bleeding. This stops bleeding by 
mechanical compression of bleeding 
varices. Complications are esophageal 
erosions or rupture, aspiration and 
asphyxia from tracheal obstruction by the 
balloon. 
Diet: While there is bleeding, nothing is 
given orally except ice pieces. Once bleeding 
has stopped, bland diet may be given. The 
food given must be oflow residue and the 
patient must be encouraged to chew it well. 
Gastric irritants like tea, coffee, alcohol, 
smoking, aerated water, chillies are avoided. 
Vitamins and Hematinics: Vitamin C and 
A are often given in a bleeding patient 
usefulness is doubtful. Once bleeding stops, 
if iron deficiency anemia is detected, iron 
may be given. 
387 

II.Surgical
I.Endoscopic intervention is treatment of
choice.
2.For peptic ulcer: If there is massive,
continuous and uncontrolled bleeding,
the following surgical procedures may be
tried: Under-running of bleeder, excision
of ulcer, partial gastrectomy, pyloroplasty
and vagotomy. Now rarely done.
3.For portal hypertension: Emergency
sclerotherapy, Varix ligation or porto­
caval anasto-mosis can be done, but
mortality and morbidity are high. Hence,
patient must be carefully selected with the
following criteria:. serum albumin above
3 mg%, bilirubin < 
3 gm%, prothrombin
time not more than 4 sec. above control,
absence of ascites and encephalopathy.
15 > Acute Gastroenteritis / 
Food Poisoning __ _ 
Acute gastroenteritis is characterized by vomiting, 
diarrhea and abdominal cramps following ingestion of 
some irritant or infected food. It is caused by ingestion 
of Salmonella organisms or toxin of Staphylococci, 
E.coli, Cl. welchii and even normal intestinal flora.
Fungi like Candida albicans and enteroviruses may
also cause gastroenteritis.
Management 
I. 
2. 
388 Diet: The patient should be given a bland diet 
with added salt and sour lime. If there is no 
vomiting, over 2000 ml of fluid should be given 
in the form of soup, coconut water, fruit juices, 
kanji, dal water or barley water. Milk and milk 
products should be avoided. Soft foods like 
bananas, mashed potatoes, soft rice, toast and 
biscuits are given if the patient tolerates them. 
Fluids and electrolytes: The patient is encouraged 
to take oral fluids. If vomiting prevents oral intake 
or if there is severe dehydration, intravenous 
fluids should be given. The amount offluids given 
should be such thatthe patient has a urine output 
of 1-1.5 liters/day. Sodium loss can be corrected 
by 500 ml of isotonic saline, in addition to the 3.

5. PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
normal saline equaling the volume of vomits 
and stools. With severe diarrhea potassium 
too is lost. It is best given orally as fruit juices, 
coconut water and vegetable soups. If necessary, 
oral potassium citrate 2-3 gm 6 hourly is given. 
Intravenous potassium is given, if required, in a 
drip of 500 cc 5% glucose containing 20-40 mEq 
ofit. 
Acid-base: Patients with diarrhea lose 
bicarbonate and may frequently develop 
metabolic acidosis. Ketoacids due to starvation 
may aggravate it. Sodium bicarbonate 2-4 gm 
orally 3-4 times may be given. It can also be 
given intravenously as 100 cc of 7.5% sodium 
bicarbonate. 
Antibacterials: In case of bacterial infection, 
oral streptomycin l gm tds or chloramphenicol 
250 mg four times a day was given in the past. 
Oral quinolone, ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin and 
tinidazole or metronidazole are often combined. 
Oral sulfonamides are also useful. 
Symptomatic 
a.Abdominal cramps could be relieved by
propantheline tablets.
b.Binding of stools is achieved by pectin
kaolin 1 tablespoon three times a day,
codeine sulfate 15 mg three times a day or
diphenoxylate 5 mg three times a day.
c.Vomiting can be controlled by
metoclopramide or domperidone 10 mg
tds
6.Prophylaxis: All uncooked and cold, stored,
outside food should be avoided.
16 > Acute Pancreatitis 
Acute pancreatitis is an acute abdominal medical 
emergency. Obstruction of the pancreatic duct or 
regurgitation of bile into the pancreas damages the 
pancreatic acini and releases, initially, minute amounts 
of trypsin which activates phospholipase to produce fat 
necrosis, elastase to produce hemorrhagic pancreatitis 
and kallikrein to produce shock. 
Management 
1.Analgesics: The severe abdominal pain requires

( 7 > Medical Emergencies 
high doses of analgesics. Injection pethidine 100 
mg IM 8 hourly or meperidine may be required. 
Morphine is avoided as it causes spasm of 
sphincter of Oddi. 
2.Fluids and electrolytes: Hypovolemic shock
is common and requires adequate fluids
intravenously . About 2-3 liters offluids should be 
given to ensure a daily urine output of 1.5-2 liters.
Glucose, potassium and calcium supplements
should also be given as required.
3.Nil by Mouth: Patient must not be given anything
by mouth.
4.Blood transfusion: This is helpful if blood
hemoglobin level has fallen as happens with
hemorrhagic pancreatitis.
5.Antibiotics: Gentamicin 60 mg or ampicillin
500 mg 8 hourly helps to eradicate secondary
infection.
6.Trasylol: 500,000 units as an intravenous bolus
has been useful in experimental animals. Its
value in human being is not yet proved.
7.H2-receptor antagonists: This has not been
found useful.
8.Drugs to inhibit pancreatic secretion: Food
and gastric juice in the duodenum stimulate
pancreatic secretion. Hence stomach should be
kept empty by passing a nasogastric tube and
applying suction. Orally nothing is given except
antacids, till abdominal pain subsides.
Propantheline bromide 15-30 mg IM every 8
hourly or pipenzolate bromide 5 mg IM 8 hourly
helps to decrease pancreatic secretion.
9.Monitoring: TPR, BP and abdominal girth must
be regularly monitored.
10.Pancreatic abcess and gallstone pancreatitis
will need antimicrobials and SOS surgery.
11.Pseudocyst can be aspirated under CT guidance.
Hepatic encephalopathy is a potentially reversible 
disturbance of brain function due to liver disease and/ 
or portal-systemic shunting of the blood. Precipitating Factors 
A.Trauma: Ascitic tapping or surgery
B.Infections: Pneumonia
C.Vascular: GI bleeding and portal vein thrombosis
D.Miscellaneo us: Electrolyte imbalance, high
protein diet and diarrhea
Pathogenesis 
The clinical features of hepatic coma are due to the 
action ofnitrogenous toxins on the brain. Many toxins 
present in the gut, which fail to get metabolized in 
the liver, reach the brain through blood circulation. 
Management 
1.The precipitating factors as mentioned above
must be treated or avoided if possible. E.g.
hypokalemia should be treated with potassium
and drugs like morphine, pethidine or diuretics
should be avoided if possible.
2.Diet: Oral proteins are to be discontinued
because of the deleterious effects of ammonia
that is formed in the gastrointestinal tract.
However, parenteral amino acids can be given as
they prevent endogenous nitrogen breakdown.
Branched chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine
and valine are given as 500 ml. of8% solution and
are especially useful. They are contra-indicated
if there is associated azotemia.
3.Measures that affect intestinal bacteria
a.Neomycin 4 gm/day or ampicillin 2-4 gm/
day are used to sterilize the bowel and thus
reduce endogenous ammonia production.
If there is associated renal insufficiency
neomycin is not given, as it is nephrotoxic.
b.Lacto-acidophilus bacillus: This lowers the
colonic pH which probably alters the gut
flora and perhaps also reduces the intestinal
absorption of ammonia.
c.Lactulose: This is a synthetic disaccharide
effective in the treatment of hepatic coma.
It lowers the pH and causes diarrhea. It
can be given orally in the dose of 30-45
ml.6 hourly or as an enema with 300 ml
oflactulose with 700 ml water.
389 

4. d.Cleaning enema and bowel washes: This is
usually done at least twice a day using tap
water. It can be given with lactose 25%
instead of water. The procedure is continued
till the returning fluid is free offecal matter.
This is one of the most effective methods
of reducing bowel flora and nitrogenous
material.
Fluids, electrolytes and calories: Initially all 
fluids and calories are administered parenterally. 
About 1,200 calories per day are given in the 
form of 10-25% dextrose. Glucose 4 gm/kg/ 
day is usually given round the clock to prevent 
hypoglycemia. 
Hypokalemia is a common complication and 
hence 60 mEq/day of potassium should be 
given slowly intravenously in three divided 
doses. Potassium is usually given orally once 
oral feeds are started. Lactic acidosis, which is 
also common, is treated with parenteral sodium 
bicarbonate. 
5.Infection: Infections should be controlled with
antibiotics. Prophylactic use of antibiotics to

prevent infection is controversial because their 
use may encourage the growth of Candida group 
of organisms. 
Artificial hemoperfusion: The aim of hemo­
perfusion is to clear the amino acids from the 
blood in view of severe hyperaminoaciduria in 
fulminant hepatic failure. With hemoperfusion 
the amino acid clearance is rapid (SO gm in 4 
hours). Clinically improvement is significant, 
but ultimate survival rate is not affected. 
Mannitol: Intravenous 350-500 ml of mannitol 
helps the raised intracranial tension.

19 Meningitis 
Meningitis is the inflammation of leptomeninges. It 
is commonly due to pyogenic bacteria and tubercle 
bacillus and less commonly due to any virus, spiro­
chete or fungus. 
Pyogenic Meningitis 
The common organisms causing pyogenic menin­
gitis are meningococci, pneumococci, H. influenza, 
streptococci, staphylococci, E.coli and Pseudomonas. 
Management 
I.Specific treatment: The specific treatment of
pyogenic meningitis is high doses of appropriate
antibiotics, preferably two drugs.
A.When the causative organism is not known:
Usually two or three drugs are given
initially to covera wide range oforganisms.
Dexamethasone 0.4 mg/kg ql2h for days
is benificial for bacterial meningitis due to
Hemophilus type b:
1.Infants aged 1-3 months: Ampicillin
plus Cefotaxime or Ceftriaxone plus
Dexamethasone.
2.Infants above 3 montha, children
and young adults: Cefotaxime or
ceftriaxone plus Dexamethasone.

7 Medical Emergencies 
3.Older adults (above 50 yrs):
Cefotaxime or ceftriaxone plus
Ampicillin plus Dexamethasone.
These are continued till the patient is
better and CSF improves. Thereafter,
the dose is reduced. However, once
the causative organism is identified,
the drug effective against that is given
and the others discontinued.
B.When the causative organism is known:
The drugs given depend upon the type of
organism and antibiotic sensitivity tests.
II.Management of unconscious patient: If the
patient has altered consciousness, nursing care
for unconscious patients should be given.
III.Management of raised intracranial pressure:
As given above.
IV.Symptomatic treatment:
1.High fever can be reduced by tepid sponging
over the body and oral or intramuscular
paracetamol 500 mg every6-8 hours. Acetyl
salicylic acid can also be used orally or
rectally.
2.Convulsions can be controlled with
phenobarbitone 30-60 mg 8 hourly or
phenytoin sodium 100 mg 8 hourly. For
uncontrolled convulsions, diazepam 5-10
mg can be used intravenously.
3.Hypotension and shock may occur with
meningococcalmeningitis. Hydrocortisone
hemisuccinate 100 mg IV 6 hrly or dexa­
methasone 6 mg IV 6 hourly may be used.
V.Treatment of complications: If brain abscess
develops in surgically accessible area, it should
be drained. For symptomatic hydrocephalus not
responding to dehydrating measures, ventriculo­
atrial shunt should be done.
Tuberculous Meningitis 
Management 
I.Specific treatment: The above drugs should be
given as soon as the diagnosis is made:
1.Rifampicin 450-600 mg orally half an hour
before breakfast.2.Isonicotinic acid hydrazide (INH) 300-400
mg orally.
3.Pyrazinamide 1.5-2 gm orally.
These drugs should be continued for 9-18
months.
If drugs cannot be given orally the following 
drugs may be given. 
l.Injection Streptomycin l gm IM.
2.Injection INH 400 mg IM.
Once oral intake is started the above three drugs 
are started. 
II.Steroids: Initially dexamethasone 4 mg 12
hourly is given and later oral prednisolone
30-40 mg with antacids is given for 3-6 months
and gradually tapered. Steroids are supposed
to help reduce complications.

sharp or hard objects.
391 

2.Padded mouth gag should be inserted
between the teeth to avoid tongue injury.
3.Tight clothing should be untied and
adequateclearairway should be maintained.
4.Diazepam 5-10 mg should be given slowly
intravenously till the fits subside. It can be
repeated if required. However, care should
be taken as it may cause sudden respiratory
arrest.
II.Long term drug therapy
Principles:
1.The drugs should be given in adequate
doses for an adequate period such that
there is cessation of convulsions. It should
be continued for at least 3 years after the
last fit.
2.Abrupt discontinuation of the drugs must
be avoided as it may precipitate status
epilepticus. Drugs must be increased or
decreased gradually.
3.Preferably convulsions must be controlled
with a single drug. However, if required,
combination of drugs may be given.
A.Grand-ma! epilepsy can be controlled
by one or more of the following drugs:
1.Phenytoin sodium 200-400 mg.
daily.
2.Carbamazepine6 00-1800mgdaily
in divided doses.
3.Sodium valproate 0.25-1.0 gm
daily.
4.Phenobarbitone 60-180 daily.
5.Primidone 750-1500 mg daily in
divided doses.
B.Focal epilepsy can be controlled by
one or more of phenobarbitone,
phenytoin sodium, primidone and
carbamazepine. Sodium valproate is
not very useful for focal epilepsy.
C.Petit mal epilepsy can be controlled
by:
1.Ethosuximide 750-1500 mg daily.
2.Sodium valproate 
250-1000 mg
daily.
III.Social and Psychological aspects:
1.The patient and the relatives should be
392 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
educated about the nature of the illness, its 
precipitating factors and its consequences. 
2.Restrictions should be minimum especially
in children as they are in danger of being
over protected. Cycling, driving and
swimming alone at sea should be avoided.
3. The patient should be advised to take
occupation in which neither he, nor the
community is put at risk by propensity of
fits. Exposure to moving machinery and
work at height should be avoided.
Status Epilepticus 
Status epilepticus is alternate period of convulsions 
and unconsciousness without any intervening normal 
period. It is a medical emergency because it may be 
fatal if not rapidly controlled. 
Management 
I.Maintenance of airway: The airway should be
clear to prevent asphyxia. Hence
A.Throat suction must be done frequently
B.Oral airway may be inserted.
C.The head must be turned to one side to
prevent aspiration.
II.Protection from injuries: During an epileptic fit,
the patient is prone to develop injuries. Hence
A.Side railings should be applied to the bed
to prevent a fall.
B.Padding should be applied around the
joints.
C.Mouth gag should be applied to prevent
tongue bite.
III.Anti-convulsants:
A.Diazepam 10 mg IV to be repeated after
10 minutes if required.
B.Diphenylhydantoin 25-50 mg/min IV in a
drip up to 1000 mg totally or till the seizures
stop.
C.Phenobarbitone 200 mg. I.M. or LV. diluted
in 50 ml normal saline over 10 minutes.
(Serious hypotension and respiratory
failure may occur when these two are
given).

< 7 } Medical Emergencies 
D.Paraldehyde 5 ml. l.M. on either buttock.
E.General anesthesia: If the above measures
fail.
IV.Management of unconscious patient: As above.
V.Subsequent treatment:
A.The dose of anti-convulsant drugs must be
adjusted.
B.Infections if present must be treated
with appropriate antibiotics as they may
precipitate status epilepticus.
23 > Sickle Cell Crisis 
Patients of sickle cell anemia may be asymptomatic 
but under certain circumstances like exposure to cold, 
anoxia, acidosis or infection, increased sickling may 
occur resulting in sickle cell crisis. 
Management 
1.The precipitating cause should be removed.
The patient must be taken to a warm area and
infection must be treated with antibiotics.
2.Oxygen inhalation may also be helpful.
3.Hydration: Adequate hydration must be
maintained with oral or intravenous fluids with
monitoring of urine output.
4.For painful sickle crisis: Analgesics
5.Exchange transfusion: To reduce HbS <30%
6.For priapism: Priapism is due to thrombosis of
the cavernous sinus of the penis by sickled cells.
Cold application of ice letting out blood from
the sinus, spinal anesthesia or local infiltration
with procaine are all useful but following relief
of priapism, the patient is often left impotent.
7.Other drugs: The other drugs useful for sickle cell
crisis are plasma volume expanders like dextran,
anticoagulants and papaverine. Antibiotics may
be required.
8.Folk acid: Folic acid long daily must be given
to aid in hemopoeisis.
9.For aplastic crisis: Red cell transfusions.
10.For leg and ankle ulcers: Rest, limb elevation,
antimicrobials, zinc sulfate dressing.11.Anti-sickling agents: Hydroxyurea, Butyrate
compounds.
12.Pneumococcal vaccine
13.Bone marrow transplantation
24 > �cute HemolY-tic Cris_lL_ 
Acute hemolytic crisis may occur with any hemolytic 
anemia but is commonly seen following mismatched 
blood transfusion, autoimmune hemolytic anemia 
and following administration of certain drugs (like 
primaquine, chloroquine, quinine, chloramphenicol, 
sulfa, etc.), especially in patients whose red cells have 
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. 
Management 
1.The precipitating factor like blood transfusion
or drug must be immediately stopped.
2. 
3. 
4. For anemia: If there is a rapidly developing
anemia due to massive hemolysis, blood
transfusions or packed cell transfusions should
be given preferably with fresh blood and washed
red cells. Till the blood is available intravenous
fluids should be started.
Corticosteroids: Hydrocortisone hemi­
succinate 100 mg 6-8 hourly should be given
especially if hemolysis has occurred following
mismatched blood transfusion or autoimmune
hemolytic anemia.
For renal failure: Rapid hemolysis may lead to
acute renal shutdown, which can be prevented
by maintaining the circulation with intravenous
fluids. Other measures which are useful are:
a.Mannitol: 350 ml of 20% solution
intravenous ly. 
b. Alkali: Sodium bicarbonate 7.5% 50-100
ml intravenously followed by oral sodium
bi-carbonate 1 gm 6 hourly to alkalinize
the urine.
c.Furosemide: 100-500mgintravenous lymay
be given as required if urine output is below
500 ml in spite of adequate circulating blood
volume. This may sometimes open up the
kidneys.
d.Dialysis: If there is acute renal shutdown,
393 

which is not relieved by the above measures, 
hemodialysis may be needed. 
25 > A�lastic Anemia 
Aplastic anemia is a severe anemia due to depression 
of the bone marrow which results in red cell aplasia, 
leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. 
Management 
1.Removal of cause: The causative agent should
be searched and if found should be immediately
stopped e.g. chloramphenicol or industrial toxin.
2.Barrier Nursing: Barrier nursing should be
carried out to prevent infection to the patient.
3.Antibiotics: High doses of potent antibiotics may
be required to counter infection. Gentamicin or
amikacin with anti-pseudomonal antibiotics like
cephalosporins or piperacillin are usually given.
4.Blood transfusions: Packed red cell transfusion
should be given to maintain the hemoglobin at
8-10 gm%. Platelet transfusion is given to treat
bleeding.
5. 
6. 
7. 
8. 
9. Androgens: Oxymetholone 3-4 mg/kg/day is
given for 3-6 months. Alternatively methyl­
testosterone 1-2 mg/kg/ day is given. These agents
and steroids may stimulate the bone marrow.
They are contraindicated with liver disease.
Immunosuppressive agents: Some of the cases
of aplastic anemia have an immunological
abnormality. Anti-lymphocytic globulin (ALG)
with cyclosporin 5 mg/kg/daycan be given.
Folk acid: 10 mg daily acid hemopoeisis.
Granulocyte Colony Stimulating factors
(G-CSF and GM-CSF) may be required.
Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation can
be tried.
10.Corticosteroids used only for treatment failures.
26 > Hemophilia 
Hemophilia A and Bare X-linked recessive disorders 
which primarily affect the males, are transmitted by 
females and is characterized by deficiency of coagula­
tion factor VIII and IX respectively. 
394 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
Management 
1.Local measures: When bleeding is in muscles or
joints, the affected part should be lightly padded
and immobilized in a position of maximum
utility. Anterior and posterior nasal ice packs
should be given for epistaxis. Firm local pressure
may stop bleeding from superficial cuts and
wounds. Local hemostasis can be achieved by 
applying fibrin glue or thrombin.
2.Replacement therapy in Hemophilia A: If
bleeding is mild, factor VIII can be replaced
by fresh frozen plasma. However, if bleeding is
severe, cryoprecipitate ( 16-17 times richer than
plasma) or factor VIII concentrates (200-250
times richer than plasma) should be given. Factor
VIII levels should be raised to at least 25% of
normal by injecting 10-15 units of factor VIII/
kg body weight. Hemophilia B is treated with
fresh frozen plasma or factor IX.
3.Epsilon 
amino caproic acid (EACA): EACA
is given in a dose of 100 mg/kg 6 hrly orally
especially if minor surgery like tooth extraction
is planned.
4. 
5. Tranexamic Acid is an anti-fibrinolytic agent
which is also used.
Miscellaneous:
a.Analgesics: Paracetamol or dextropro­
oxyphene are useful to relieve pain. Aspirin
should be avoided.
b. Antibiotics: Ampicillin 1-15 gm/day may 
be required to treat infections.
c.Intramuscular injections and cuts and
wounds should be avoided. The former
may produce deep-seated hematomas.
d.Hematinics like iron and vitamin B complex
may be required if blood loss is severe.
27 > Renal Colic 
Renal colic is a sudden severe pain in the loin that may 
radiate into the lumbar region, down the groin and into 
the testicle on the same side. It may last from minutes 
to several hours and leaves the patient rolling in bed 
and writhing in agony. Nausea, vomiting, sweating and 
abdominal distension may also be present. 

( 7 > Medical Emergencies 
Management 
1.Bed rest and warmth over the affected area helps
to relieve pain.
2.Analgesics: Severe colic may require morphine
15 mg or pethidine 100 mg IM. Dextro­
propoxyphene or pentazocine orally are also
useful.
3.Antispasmodic: Atropine 0.6 -1.2 mg IM often
helps to relieve the pain.
4.Urinary antiseptic: In presence of infection,
urinary antiseptics like norfloxacin 400 mg twice
daily ciprofloxacin 200 mg twice daily may be
given.
5.Fluids: A high fluid intake is advised to achieve
a good 
urine output. If urine output falls,
immediate investigations like plain x-rayurinary
tract, pyelography and cystoscopy with urethral
catheterization must be required.
6.Surgery: If the urinary obstruction is present
due to a treatable cause like stone, it must be
removed surgically. Only medical treatment is
unlikely to cure it.
28 > Acute Retention of 
Urine 
Acute retention of urine is inability to pass urine which 
has collected in the urinary bladder. 
Management 
1.Reassurance: The patient who is unable to pass
urine is often anxious and strains to pass urine,
the failure of which increases the anxiety. The
patient should be reassured and asked to relax.
2.Local measures: Hot water bag may be applied
to the hypogastrium. This is however, avoided
in neurogenic bladder with loss of sensations as
the patient might burn the skin. Alternatively he
may be put in a water bath. These maneuvers
may relieve retention.
3.Cholinergic agents: Injection carbachol 0.25-
0.75 mg may be given intramuscularly. This
stimulates 
bladder wall contraction. However,
this is avoided if surgical obstruction is definitelyknown. It may aggravate bronchial asthma and 
ischemic heart disease. 
4.Catheterization: If retention persists, a simple
urinary catheter should be passed under strict
aseptic precautions, urine evacuated and catheter
removed. If repeated catheterization is needed,
a self-retaining Foley's catheter should be used.
Once catheterization is done, adequate fluids
should be administered to achieve a good urine
output. Urinary antiseptics should also be given
and if required bladder washes.
5.Supra-pubi c aspiration: If per urethral
catheterization is not possible due to impassable
obstruction, urine can be evacuated from a
full urinary bladder by per abdominal needle
aspiration just above pubic symphysis. Strict
aseptic precautions should be maintained.
6.Supra-pubic catheterization: When repeated
catheterization is required, suprapubic
cystostomy should be done and catheter inserted
into the urinary bladder.
7.Treatment of cause: 0 bstruction to the flow of
urine should be removed surgically if possible
e.g. prostatic enlargement or bladder neck
obstruction.
29 > Acute Renal Failure 
(ARF) 
Acute Renal Failure (ARF) is sudden decrease in 
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) resulting in oliguria 
( urine outputless than 400 ml/ day) and elevated blood 
urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine. 
In hypercatabolic state of acute renal failure there 
may not be reduction in GFR but BUN production far 
exceeds the ability of the kidneys to excrete it. 
Management 
I.Oliguric phase: Acute tubular necrosis (ATN)
is usually a self-limiting disorder and at present
there is no specific therapy. Hence the treatment
consists of:
a.Treatment of the cause when treatable.
b.Avoiding nephrotoxic agents.
c.Minimizing the complications of uremia.
395 

396 1.Fluids: In an oliguric patient the daily fluid
intake should not be more than previous
day's urine output and extrarenal losses
( insensible sweating, nasogastric drainage,
diarrhea etc.). The fluid balance can be
determined by weighing the patient daily.
Dehydration as well as over hydration is to
be prevented.
2.Diet: 40 gm of protein of high biological
value (first class proteins) should be given
with high carbohydrate content to provide
30 calories/kg/ day to prevent endogenous
protein breakdown. 50-75 mEq of sodium
may be given if there is no hypertension,
but potassium should be restricted.
If the patient is unable to tolerate oral
feeding, aseptic hyperalimentation should
be given providing essential amino acids
and hypertonic glucose. This helps to lower
the mortality and slows the rise of blood
urea.
3. Electrolyte and acid-base balance:
Hyperkalemia is common in renal failure.
It can be prevented by avoiding potassium
rich foods, potassium supplements and
potassium sparing diuretics. Hyperkalemia
is treated with intravenous 50 ml 50%
glucose with 5-10 units of insulin, 100
mEq of sodium bicarbonate and 10-30 ml
of calcium lactate or gluconate. Sodium
bicarbonate is also useful to treat metabolic
acidosis.
4.Infection: Infection is prevented especially
in acute renal failure because the body's
response to infection in uremia is blunted.
Indwelling catheter use is prevented, if
possible. Adequate pulmonar y toilet should
be given and antiseptic care of the infusion
sites should be taken.
5.Hypertension: Renal hypertension requires
high doses of potent antihypertensive
agents like propranolol and drugs like
hydralazine and nifedipine which increase
the renal blood flow.
6.Dialysis: When the conservative line of
treatment fails to maintain optimum
clinical status, dialysis should be instituted.PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
It is also considered when there are 
multiple complications like hyperkalemia, 
hypo-natremia, acidosis, hypertension, 
over-hydration, pericarditis etc. Usually 
alternate day peritoneal or hemodialysis 
is given, but in hypercatabolic states daily 
dialysis may be required. 
II.Diuretic phase:
During this stage, the aim is to maintain adequate
fluid and electrolyte balance. During this stage,
excess fluid retained during oliguric phase is
excreted and the patient may be dehydrated if
fluids are restricted.
30 > Diabetic Ketoacidosis 
Diabetic ketoacidosis is the exaggeration or deranged 
energy metabolism due to deficiency of insulin which 
results in accumulation of acid metabolites and ketone 
bodies. 
Management 
I.Immediate care: In a suspected case of diabetic
ketoacidosis, immediately on admission, tests
for blood glucose, electrolytes, BUN, creatinine,
blood gases and urine acetone must be done.
Blood must be collected for sugar, acetone,
electrolytes, bicarbonates and urea. Whilst
awaiting the reports, 
fluid loss must be replaced
with saline. If doubt exists, 50 cc. of 5% glucose
I.V. would help to clarify that the patient is not
in hypoglycemic coma.
II.Fluid and Electrolyte balance:
Fluid: Circulating insulin present is ineffective
because of poor tissue perfusion. Hence, tissue
perfusion must be improved. For volume
replacement normal saline(NS) is given to
treat hypovolemia, followed with NS or V:i NS
at 150-200 cc/hr. (Watch for CHF). One litre
of fluid can be given in the first half hour and
subsequently 1 litre per hour till dehydration is
corrected. Fluid replacement can be done with
isotonic saline which prevents too rapid a fall in
extracellular osmolality.
Electrolytes: Initially due to tissue catabolism,
potassium enters the circulation resulting in

( 7 > Medical Emergencies 
"false" hyperkalemia. However, once insulin 
therapy is started, along with glucose, potassium 
too enters the cells leading to a fall in serum 
potassium levels. Hence, serum potassium 
must be monitored and hypokalemia must 
be prevented with potassium supplements. 
Replacement with potassium is started after K is 
4-4.5. Sodium bicarbonate is only given if serum
bicarbonates are less than 10 mM/l and pH less
than 7.0 Bicarbonates can cause hypokalemia, a
paradoxical fall in the pH of CSF and impaired
oxyhemoglobin dissociation. Hence, its use is
not advocated in milder cases.
III.Insulin: Insulin therapy forms the main stay of
treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. It not only
lowers the blood sugar but also prevents further
lipolysis thereby preventing accumulation of
ketones and hydrogen ions. A variety of regimes
differing in dose, frequency and routes of
administration have been advocated. There is no
simple formula to calculate the requirement of
insulin and it is more often an intellectual guess.
A.Conventional therapy: Consider loading
insulin dose (0.15 U/kg) and start drip at 3
-10 units/hour. Usually 1 unit/ 10 kg/hr and
goal of dropping glucose by 75-100 mg/ dl/
hour. Once glucose is 200-300, bicarb 17-20,
anion gap resolved and trace/no ketones in
urine, consider change to SQ insulin and
starting D5W. Make sure to overlap drip
with SQ for at least 20-30 minutes.
B.Low dose therapy: The unphysiological
nature of the conventional therapy results
in marked fluctuations in plasma insulin
levels and the risk of hypoglycemia and
hypokalemia. The low dose therapy,
which is more physiological, reduces these
problems.
The circulating insulin levels ranging from
100-200 units/ml can be obtained by a
constant intravenous infusion of insulin
at a rate of2-12 units/hr. This produces a
rapid and steady fall of blood glucose.
Procedure: Insulin is given in 500 ml of
isotonic saline or glucose saline depending
upon body weight (0.1 units/kg/hr). The
rate offlow is adjusted to deliver 1 ml or 15drops a minute (approximately 6-8 units/ 
hr.) This also includes the insulin lost by 
adsorption on to the glass surface and 
rubber tubes. To minimize the adsorption, 
human albumin or a plasma substitute 
containing gelatin (haemaccel) may be 
used. A pediatric drip set can be used in 
place of the infusion pump. Patient should 
be in ICU unit until stable and off insulin 
drip. The precipitating cause must be 
treated e.g. infection infarction, no insulin, 
incisions (surgery), intoxication. 
Advantages: 
1.Frequent estimations of biochemical
parameters are not essential.
2.The fall of blood glucose starts
immediately without any lag period
and is steady and predictable.
3.There is virtually no risk of
hypoglycemia or hypokalemia.
IV.Phosphate: Phosphate depletion parallels
potassium loss and since phosphates are required
for the synthesis of 2-3 D.P.G., decreased
synthesis of the latter would shift the oxygen
dissociation curve to the left leading to cellular
hypoxia. This could thus be replaced as potassium
phosphate. For phosphate < 0.5 mg/di, 15 mg/kg
(0.5 M/Kg) is given over 4 hours. For phosphate
0.5-1.0 mg/di, 7.7 mg/kg (0.25 mM/Kg) is given
over 4-6 hours.
V.Magnesium: Supplemented to keep normal or
high end of normal in cardiac patients ( exception
-renal patients). Oral preparations include Mg
Gluconate (500 mg tablet = 2.5 meq) and Mg
Oxide (140 mg tab= 7 meq). Mg Sulfate for IV
comes in amps: 1 amp= 1 gram (8 meq). Usually
repleted with 1-2 grams and rechecked before
giving more.
31 > H �og�_ce_m_ia ___ _
Hypoglycemia is an abnormal depletion of the blood 
glucose concentration, which is manifested by a 
characteristic symptom complex, initiated when the 
nervous system is deprived of glucose. Symptomatic 
hypoglycemia occurs when blood levels are less than 
40mg%. 
397 

Treatment of Hypoglycemic Attack 
I.Glucose: Early in the attack in a conscious
patient, glucose or sugar containing liquids may
be given. If he is unable to take it orally, 50 cc
of 50% glucose given IV often has a dramatic
response. Subsequently the patient is encour­
aged to take frequent small feeds and glucose.
II.Drugs
1.Epinephrine: 0.5 cc of 1:1000 epinephrine
is given subcutaneous ly. It stimulates
hepatic gluconeogenesis and counteracts
hypoglycemia.
2.Glucocorticoid: 100 mg of hydrocortisone
hemisuccinate or 4 mg of dexamethasone
may be given I.V.
3.Glucagon: 1-2 mg. I.M. raises blood sugar.
It is expensive for routine use.
4.Mannitol and furosemide are used to reduce
cerebral edema.
Prevention of Hypoglycemia 
I.Reactive hypoglycemia
398 A.Diet: Reactive hypoglycemia can be
managed by simple dietary manipulations.
A high protein diet has been advocated as
amino acids stimulate insulin release to a
lesser extent than glucose. Hence, decreased
intake of sugar containing foods, frequent
high protein meals and caloric restriction
are useful.
B.Drugs:
1.Anticholinergic drugs are used to
inhibit vagal action and delay gastric
emptying in patients with accelerated
glucose absorption.
2.In the anxious, hyperkinetic patient
avoidance of caffeine and cigarettes
and the use of mild tranquilizers like
meprobamate or diazepam may be
beneficial.
3.Phenformin hydrochloride has been
reported to alleviate hypoglycemia in
these patients by inhibiting intestinal
glucose absorption thereby inhibiting
insulin release.PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
4.Insulin inhibitors: Certain substances
like diazoxide, propranolol and
diphenyl-hydantoin sodium
have been used for treatment of
hypoglycemia. However, they have
not been thoroughly evaluated as yet.
5.In patients with hypoglycemia
associated with early onset of diabetes,
beneficial effect has been reported
with Sulfonylureas probably because
they restore the sensitivity of beta cells
to physiological stimuli.
II.Fasting hypoglycemia:
A.Surgery: In insulinomas, surgical resection
of the functioning islet cell tumor has been
advocated.
B.Streptozotocin: In non-resectable tumors
of the pancreas, this drug is useful as it
selectively destroys pancreatic tissue.
However, following this, the patient may
require life-long insulin therapy.
32 > Res�iratory Acidosis 
Respiratory acidosis is characterized by an increase in 
pC02 and decrease in pH. Bicarbonate is normal until 
renal compensation sets in and increased it. This is done 
by excreting chlorides in preference to bicarbonates, 
thus lowering serum chlorides. 
Management 
1. 
2. 
3. The underlying disease causing respiratory 
acidosis must be treated. 
Oxygen: This is required for acute hypoxia but 
must be given with extreme caution because 
there is progressive decreased sensitivity of the 
respiratory centre to prolonged exposure to 
acidosis and hypercapnia. Hence, hypoxia is the 
only ventilatory stimulus and administration 
of oxygen removes it and worsens the patient. 
If required, oxygen should be given in the 
concentration of 24-55% with Venturi mask. 
Sodium bicarbonate: If there is uncontrollable 
hypercapnia and very low pH, sodium 
bicarbonate is given in small doses. In asthma, it 
would raise the pH and cause bronchodilatation. 

( 7 ) Medical Emergencies 
The risks are pulmonary congestion and late 
metabolic alkalosis. Usually 50-100 cc of 7.5% 
sodium bicarbonate is used. 
4.Ventilation: The patient should be put on assisted
ventilation till such time that he recovers from
his basic disease.
5.Bronchodilators, postural drainage and
antibiotics should be used as required.
33 > Metabolic Acidosis ----
Metabolic acidosis is characterized by decrease in 
pH and reduction in bicarbonate concentration. It is 
compensated by a reduction in pC02_ 
Management 
1.Alkalis: The primary aim of treatment is to
raise the systemic pH to a level where cardiac
performance and response to catecholamines
is restored and dysrhythmias are less likely to
occur.
2. Sodium bicarbonate should be given intra­
venously. Rapid replacement, however, may
result in paradoxical rise in pH of CSF and
impaired oxygen delivery, hypocalcemia and
hypokalemia. Hence, only partial correction of
acidosis to a pH of 7.2 should be aimed at and
no alkalies should be given if pH is above 7.3.
Specific treatment: The underlying metabolic
derangement should be treated e.g. withdrawal
of toxic substances, hyperglycemia, fluid and
electrolyte imbalance.
a.Diabetic ketoacidosis: In diabetic
ketoacidosis, insulin therapywouldenhance
ketoacid utilization with bicarbonate
regeneration and spontaneous correction
of acidosis. Hence alkalies are given only
if pH is less than 7.1 or bicarbonates are
less than 6 mEq/1.
b.Alcoholic ketoacidosis: This also responds
to glucose and saline infusions and alkalies
are given only if pH is less than 7.1
c.Proximal tubular acidosis: Here the
threshold for bicarbonate is set below
the normal value of 26 mEq/L. Hence,bicarbonate wasting occurs when the 
plasma bicarbonate is raised above the 
apparent renal threshold. Hence correction 
of acidosis with bicarbonates increases 
bicarbonaturia. A new approach is to 
decrease the effective circulatory volume 
by sodium restriction. Contraction of 
the extracellular fluid would reset the 
glomerulotubular balance upwards and 
raise the fractional rate of sodium and 
consequently bicarbonate reabsorption by 
the proximal tubule. 
d.Methyl alcohol: Administration of ethyl
alcohol may be useful Acidosis is corrected
by dialysis.
3.Dialysis: Whenever the acidosis is severe
and uncorrected by large doses of alkalies,
hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis must be done.
34 > Res�iratory Alkalo�is 
Respiratory alkalosis is characterized by an increase 
in pH and decrease in pC02• Renal compensation 
would reduce the plasma bicarbonate concentration. 
Management 
1.The treatment of the underlying cause usually
corrects respiratory alkalosis.
2.Rebreathing bag: If there is syncope or
tetany due to psychogenic hyperventilation,
a rebreathing paper bag would allow carbon
dioxide retention and correction of acid-base
abnormality. This should be used cautiously
and only if serious cerebrovascular disorder
has been excluded.
3.Sedative: If rebreathing in a bag is not possible,
sedatives like diazepam 5-10 parenterally may
be helpful.
35 > Metabolic Alkalosis 
Metabolic alkalosis is characterized by an increase in 
pH and an increase in bicarbonates. The respiratory 
response is not usually fully compensated and hence 
there is only a slight elevation of pC02• 
399 

Management 
I.Saline-responsive: In this group of patients the
urinary chloride is less than 10 mEq/L.
1.Intravenous or oral sodium chloride
and potassium chloride are given which
suppresses acid excretion and promotes
bicarbonate excretion.
2.In severe cases, mineral acids like arginine
monohydrochloride is given to titrate the
excessive bicarbonate stores. Ammonium
chloride too, can be used, but has CNS
toxicity.
II.Saline resistant:
1.Potassium: This is useful in hyperldosteron­
ism as potassium reverses the intracellular
shift of hydrogen ions and enhances
bicarbonate excretion.
2.Spironolactone: Inhyperaldosteronism, this
drug acts as a physiological antagonist.
3.Acetazolamide: In edematous states
where saline therapy is contraindicated,
acetazolamide is useful as it increases the
excretion of bicarbonates and reduces
edema.
36 > Dehydration --------------
Dehydration is a deficit in total body water. Almost 
all forms of dehydration are associated with loss of 
electrolytes as well. 
Management 
1.Fluids: The patient with dehydration requires
fluids. The amount and type of fluid required
depends upon the nature of the fluid lost e.g.
plasma or blood should be given for burns,
dextrose in a comatose patient and saline in
vomiting. The amount of fluid varies. It depends
upon the amount lost. Adequate hydration can
be judged from physical signs, urinary output
and specific gravity and hematocrit.
2.Electrolyte and Acid-base: The associated
electrolyte or acid-base disturbance must be
simultaneously corrected e.g. in diarrhea,
potassium should be supplemented, in diabetic
acidosis, sodium bicarbonate may be required.
400 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
3.Treatment of cause: The primary cause must
be treated. Insulin for diabetes mellitus,
corticosteroids for Addison's disease, pituitary
extract for diabetes insipidus, etc.
37 > Hy�ernatremia - -------
Hypernatremia is increase in serum sodium. 
Management 
The treatment depends upon the underlying cause. 
1. 
2. 
3. When water loss is accompanied by little 
or no sodium loss as in diabetes insipidus, 
oral replacement with water or intravenous 
dextrose is adequate. To treat diabetes insipidus, 
desmopressin or vasopressin may be necessary. 
When water loss is also accompanied by loss 
of electrolytes, Ringer's lactate solution may be 
used. 
If there is increased body sodium, in addition 
to water replacement a diuretic like furosemide 
40 mg may be given. 
38 > Hyponatremia 
Hyponatremia is diminished serum sodium. 
Management 
1.Fluid restriction: The intake offluid is restricted
below the urinary and insensible fluid losses.
2. 
3. Saline infusion: When neurological
manifestations occur due to hyponatremia, the
electrolyte imbalance must be corrected with
normal or hypertonic (3%) saline intravenously.
The amount of sodium required can be calculated
by the following formula:
Sodium (Na) deficit (mEq) =
0.6 X (Normal Na -Patient's sodium) (Wt in Kg)
Saline infusions should be avoided in dilutional
hyponatremia.
Treatment of cause: The treatment of cause
should be instituted. In SIADH, demeclocycline
or lithium salts may be given, whereas in
dilutional hyponatremia, along with water
restriction, judicious use of diuretics is useful.

( 7 } Medical Emergencies 
39 > Hy_perkalemia 
Hyperkalemia is a rise in serum potassium level. It is 
a potentially life threatening complication most often 
occuring with uremia. 
Management 
I.To counteract the action of potassium and
cause its intercellular shift.
1.Calcium gluconate 10-30 ml of 10%
solution is injected intravenously slowly. It
antagonizes the toxic effects of potassium
but does not reduce serum potassium level.
2.Glucose insulin drip: 500 cc. of5-10% glucose
is given in a drip with about 20-30 units of
insulin. Potassium ions enter the cell along
with glucose with the help of insulin.
3.Sodium bicarbonate: 100-200 ml of 7.5%
sodium bicarbonate cause a change in pH
temporarily. Hence, potassium ions migrate
from plasma to 
the cells.
4.Hemodialysis: In a case of chronic renal
failure, hemodialysis itself can reduce the
potassium levels.
II.To remove potassium from the body.
Cation exchange resin: Sodium resin (Kayexalate)
20 gm mixed with 30 ml of 50% sorbitol (to
prevent 
constipation) is used. It can also be given
rectally as a retention enema for 30 minutes.
III.Treatment of the cause:
The treatment of the primary disease e.g.
Addison's disease with steroids, hypoaldoster­
onism with 9 alpha fluorohydro-cortisone etc.
helps to correct the serum potassium levels.
40 > Hy_pokalemia 
Hypokalemia is reduced serum potassium level. 
Management 
The treatment consists of 
replacement therapy with 
potassium. Usually oral route is preferred. Potassium 
chloride 1 gm three or four times a day is given. If 
serum potassium is 3 mEq/L, the potassium deficit 
is usually 300 mEq and at 2-2.5 mEq/L, the deficit is 
usually 500 mEq. Such large deficits usually require intravenous potassium in 500 ml 5% glucose drip, 
each drip containing 40 mEq of potassium and last­
ing 6-8 hours. 
41 > Acute Hypercalcemia 
Acute hypercalcemia is increase in serum calcium. 
Management 
Correct dehydration, increase renal calcium excretion, 
decrease bone resorption, and treat the underlying 
disorder. 
1.IV hydration 2.5-4 liters NS per day; watch for
CHF.
2.IV furosemide 10-20 mg IV BID after volume
replete; keep 1=0.
3.Specific treatments in approximate desirability
of use:
a.Calcitonin 4 U/Kg SQ BID to 8 U/Kg SQ
QID -rapid 
acting, short acting, often see
rebound.
b.Etidronate 7.5 mg/kg over 4 hours QD x
3-7 days. Slower acting, more effective.
c.Pamidronate 15-45 mg IV slowly QD x 6
days or as single IV infusion of 90 mg over
24 hours. Also very effective.
d.Plicamycin (mithramycin-chemotherapy
agent) 25 mcg/kg over 4-6 hours Q 1-2
days. Be careful in renal or hepatic failure.
e.Gallium nitrate 200 mg/m2 body surface
area in 1 liter IV fluid per day x 
5 days.
Nephrotoxin, but also very effective.
f.Glucocorticoids 200-300 mg hydro­
cortisone IV QD x 3-5 days.
42 > Amebic Dy_sentery_ ----
Amebic dysentery is the disease due to invasion of the 
intestine by Entameba histolytica. 
Management 
I.Symptomatic:
1.Diarrhea must be treated with binding
mixtures.
401 

2.Fluid and electrolyte imbalance must be 
corrected with appropriate intravenous
infusions.
3.General debility and anemia should be
treated with iron, vitamin B complex
therapy and high protein diet.
II.Definitive Treatment:
1.Metronidazole: 800 mg three times a day
is given for 8-10 days. It is useful for
both intestinal as well as extraintestinal
amebiasis. It causes nausea, vomiting and
metallic taste in the mouth. It can also
be given intravenously 500 mg/100 ml 8
hourly.
2.Tinidazole:Thishassimil arpharmacological
effects as metronidazole but the toxic effects
are less marked. It is given in the doses of
600 mg. thrice daily for five days.
3. Emetine: In severe amebic dysentery
associated with liver involvement, emetine
hydrochloride 65 mg for 3 to 10 days is given
along with metronidazole or tinidazole.
4.Diloxanide furoate is given in the dose of0.5
g.three times a day for 10 days especially
in luminal cases.
5.Iodochlorhydroxyquinoline and Diiodo­
hydroxyquinoline given for 8-10 days are
also useful in intestinal amebiasis.
6.Tetracycline: In acute amebic dysentery
Tetracycline 250 mg four times a day helps
to eradicate luminal amebae.
III.Prevention
Amebiasis can be prevented by avoiding contact
with food contaminated with human feces. The
drinking water should be boiled and vegetables
should be washed in a strong detergent and
rinsed in dilute acids like vinegar.
43 > Bacillar Disenteri __ 
Bacillary dysentery is caused by acute infection due 
to Shigella group of organisms. 
Management 
I.Correction of water and electrolyte imbalance:
Most patients can be managed at home. Fluid
402 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
intake should be adequate, oral electrolyte 
solutions are given to correct the water and 
electrolyte losses. Potassium 3-4 gm thrice daily 
orally may be required as it is lost in diarrhea 
fluid. 
II.Specific treatment: Shigella organisms are
sensitive to sulphonamide drugs. Phthalyl
sulphathiazole is given in the dose of 1.5-2 gm. 8
hourly. Succinylsulphathiazole is the other drug
of choice. Once the diarrhea is under control,
the dosage can be reduced. If sulphonamide
resistance is present, ampicillin 250 mg 6 hourly
or tetracycline 250 mg 6 hourly can be given.
III.Prevention:
Prophylaxis can be achieved by the following
measures:
1.Isolation of proved cases
2.Disinfection of excreta, clothing and bed
linen of the patient
3.Protection and treatment of carriers
4.Prevention of fecal contamination of food
and water
44 > Cholera 
Cholera caused by V. cholerae was one of the most 
common gastrointestinal emergencies in tropical 
countries. It is characterized by acute onset of diarrhea, 
vomiting, fluid and electrolyte depletion, dehydration 
and acidosis. V. cholerae produces an exotoxin which 
stimulates the adenyl cyclase in the intestinal epithe­
lial cell and resultant increase in the 3.5 cyclic AMP 
leads to secretion of isotonic fluid by all segments of 
the secretion into the intestinal lumen. This occurs 
in absence of any demonstrable histological lesion 
in the intestinal cells, or capillary endothelial cells of 
lamina propria. 
Management 
1. 
2. Isolation: The patient should be isolated and all 
the excreta of the patient measured and properly 
disposed off. 
Fluid, electrolyte and alkali Intravenous fluids 
should be immediately started with 500 cc of 
normal saline at the rate of 50-100 ml/min. 

{ 7 ) Medical Emergencies 
initially till the pulse volume improves. Later, the 
rate of saline, injection can be reduced. Along 
with saline 200-500 cc of7.5% soda bicarbonate 
or 1/6 normal lactate can be given. The amount 
offluid to be given daily should be more than the 
volume of stools passed. Once vomiting subsides 
and pulse volume improves, fluid should be 
given orally. Dacca solution is commonly used. 
It consists of: 
1.Sodium chloride 5 gm.
2.Sodium bicarbonate 4 gm.
3.Potassium chloride 1 gm.
4.Distilled water up to 1 litre.
Sodium absorption through the intestine 
is enhanced when it is administered simul­
taneouslywith glucose and amino acids. Glucose, 
in addition, combats acidosis. Hence, these 
substances are also added to the oral solution. 
Composition of oral fluid: 
1.Sodium chloride 4.2 gm/L (72 mEq/L)
2.Sodium bicarbonate 4.0 gm/L ( 46 mEq/L)
3.Potassium citrate 5.75 gm/L (25 mEq/L)
4. Glucose 20.0 gm/L (110 mEq/L)
5.Glycine 8.25 gm/L (110 mEq/L)
6.Boiled water up to 1000 ml.
At home, oral rehydration solution can be 
prepared as follows: 
1.Table salt 1 teaspoon 
2.Soda bicarb 1 teaspoon 
3.Potassium citrate 1 teaspoon
4.Glucose 1 tablespoon 
5.Boiled water l litre 
Sour lime or any other flavoring agent may be 
added. Fluid should be given till diarrhea stops. 
Usually it occurs in 1-2 days. 
3.Antibiotics: Although adequate fluids alone
result in rapid recovery, a dramatic reduction
in the duration and volume of diarrhea occurs
with antibiotics. Tetracycline 500 mg 6 hourly
should be given for 5 days. Chloramphenicol and
furazolidone are other drugs, also effective, but
less than tetracycline.
4.Prevention: Immunization by standardcommercial vaccine containing 10 billion killed 
organisms 
per ml. gives limited protection for 
4-6 months. Hence, it is only useful for travelers
who visit the endemic areas for a short period.
45 >Ty�hoiL 
(Refer Pg. 98) 
Dengue is caused by four distinct subgroups of den­
gue viruses, which occurs through mosquito (Aedes 
aegypti) bites. Dengue viral infection can present in 
three clinical patterns. 
I.Classic Dengue Fever
Clinical Features
1.Conjunctiv itis: Prodromal symptoms
following incubation period of 5-8 days.
Conjunctiva! congestion and tenderness
upon pressure on eyeballs are seen.
2.Fever, coryza and headache: Abrupt onset
with splitting headache, retro-orbital pain,
backache, leg and joint pains. Headache
is aggravated by head movements. Saddle
back fever may be present-fever disappears
after a few days of onset and returns after
few days.
3.Insomnia, anorexia (with loss of taste or
bitter taste), weakness, lymphadenopathy,
skin rashes
Diagnosis 
Leukopenia (with neutropenia) with isolation of 
virus from blood and rising viral antibody titre. 
Mostly it is a serological diagnosis. 
Treatment 
Symptomatic treatment with analgesics and 
antipyretics. 
II.Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF)
WHO Criteria for Diagnosis ofDHF
1.Fever: Acute onset, high continuous fever
lasting for 2 -7 days.
403 

2.Hemorrha gic manifestatio n includingatleast
a positive tourniquet test and any one of the
following: petechiae, purpura, ecchymosis,
epistaxis, bleeding gums, hematemesis,
melena.
3.Liver enlargement
4.Thrombocytopenia: Platelet count <
l,00,000/mm3 
5.Hemoconcentration: Hematocrit increased
by> 20%
Table 7 .5 : WHO Clinical Classification of 
Drugs 
Grade Clinical Features 
Fever, Constitutional symptoms, positive tourni­
quet test 
II Grade I plus spontaneous bleeding 
Ill Grade II plus circulatory failure, agitation 
IV Grade II plus profound shock (DSS) 
Undetectable Blood Pressure 
All four grades are associated with 
hemoconcentration and thrombocytopenia 
III.Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS)
WHO Criteria for Diagnosis ofDSS
Weak pulse with narrowing of pulse pressure ( <
20 mm Hg) or hypotension with cold, clammy
skin and restlessness
Management of DHF and DSS 
Both DHF and DSS are treated entirely symptomati­
cally with fluid replacement, blood transfusions and 
corticosteroids. Patients often need ICU care with 
hemodynamic monitoring, antimicrobials, hemato­
logical and nutritional support. 
47>Lepto s�i_ro_s_i_s���-
Leptospirosis is a zoonotic infection which is caused 
by Leptospira interrogans, a tightly coiled spirochete 
with one axial filament. 
Reservoirs of infection include rodents, skunks, foxes, 
domestic livestock and dogs. Human infection can 
occur either by direct contact with urine or tissue of 
infected animals or indirectly through contaminated 
404 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
water, soil or vegetation. Transmission may occur 
through cuts, mucous membrane and possibly un­
broken skin. Tissue damage results from direct toxic 
action ofleptospira or immune response to leptospiral 
antigens. 
1.Most infections appear 7 -14 days after exposure
and last for 5 -10 days & resolve spontaneously.
2.Biphasic illness
Initial first phase (leptospiremic phase) lasts for
4 -9 days and leptospira are present in the blood
and CSF.
Second phase (immune phase) follows after
a period of apparent recovery. The symptoms
worsen for another 2-4 days. Meningitis and
iridocyclitis are more common. Leptospiral
antibodies are present in the blood, leptospira
disappear from the blood and urine cultures are
positive for the organism.
Clinical Features 
1.Fever: High grade with chills and rigors
2.Headache: Severe and retro-orbital or occipital
3.Conjunctiva/ suffusion: Pericorneal reddening
or hyperemia.
4.Myalgia: Severe and affect muscles of thigh and
lumbar areas. Severe muscle tenderness and
cutaneous hyperesthesia present
5.Asceptic meningitis: Combination of fever,
headache, neck stiffness or pain due to myalgias
suggests meningitis. CSF is usually acellular for
first 7 days. Aseptic meningitis occurs in 90% of 
patients with abnormal CSF.
6.Cough, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, skin rash,
uveitis.
7. 
8. Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal
pain, hemorrhage, splenomegaly, acute dilatation
of gall bladder with cholecystitis, diarrhea,
hepatomegaly, jaundice.
CNS: Drowsiness, encephalitis, cranial nerve
palsies.
Management 
1.Penicillin 1.5 million units IV 6 hrly for 7 days
or any beta-lactam antibiotic.

( 7 > Medical Emergencies 
2. 
3. Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days 
started within 4 days of onset of symptoms 
Fluid and electrolyte therapy: Especially for renal 
failure and jaundice. 
4.Dialysis for renal failure
5.Exchange transfusions in severe hyper­
bilirubinemia.
6.Blood transfusion may be required if anemia and
thrombocytopenia present.
48 > Di�htheria _______ _
Diphtheria is an acute infectious disease caused by 
Corynebacterium diphtheriae and characterized by 
local exudates on the mucous membranes of nose, 
throat and larynx and systemic toxemia. 
Management 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. Bed-rest: This is required as the toxins can affect 
the heart. Usually bed-rest is required for 3-6 
weeks. 
Antitoxin: Anti-diphtheria serum, prepared 
from horses which have been immunized 
by injection of diphtheria toxin, is given 
subcutaneously or intramuscularly in the dose of 
10,000 -1,00,000 units depending on the severity 
of the disease. It may be repeated after 12 hours, 
if required. A test dose is usually given before 
giving the injection to exclude hypersensitivity. 
Antibiotics: A course of ampicillin or 
erythromycin 500 mg 6 hourly should be given 
to eradicate the diphtheria bacillus. Antibiotics 
do not have any effect on the existing toxemia, 
which can be neutralized only by the antitoxin. 
General Management: 
a.Diet: In mild cases, normal diet may be
allowed. In moderate to severe cases,
initially, fluids are given orally. Gradually
semi-solid diet is added and by 2-4 weeks,
solid diet is given. If there is palatal palsy
semi-solid food is preferred to liquids
because liquids may be regurgitated from
the nose. If swallowing is affected, feeding
should be with Ryle's tube.
b.Care of mouth: The mouth should be cleaned5. 
6. by wiping with damp wool swabs, which are 
burnt after use. Similarly, nasal discharge 
should be removed. Syringing the throat 
and gargling are best avoided. 
Treatment of Complications: 
a.Cardiac failure: Diuretics and digitalis may
have to be given. Digitalis is not very helpful
in diphtheria! myocarditis.
b.Palatal palsy: Head-low position may be
given to drain the secretions of the mouth.
c.Laryngeal obstruction: Tracheostomy may
be required if there is laryngeal obstruction.
Prophylaxis: Active immunization is given to 
children at age fourth, fifth and sixth month 
along with tetanus and pertussis. 
49 > Tetanus 
Tetanus is the disease caused by the toxin of 
Clostridium tetani and is characterized by muscular 
rigidity, spasms and autonomic disturbances. 
Management 
1.The patient must be kept in isolation in a separate
ward and dark room with minimal noise.
2.ATS (anti-tetanus serum) 10,000 units is given
intravenously on admission to neutralize
circulating toxin. Anti-tetanus immunoglobulin
is also available, but is costly.
3.Penicillin: Injection procaine penicillin 8 lakhs
units should be given daily intramuscularly for
8-10 days orone dose ofbenzathine penicillin 2.4
mega units should be given to kill the clostridial
organisms in the wound.
4.Local wound and ear infection should be
adequately treated with dressing or antibiotic
drops. The wound should be kept open as the
bacteria grow rapidly in anaerobic conditions.
5. 
6. Muscle relaxants: High doses of diazepam
may be required 
repeatedly if there are spasms.
Usually it is given 4-6 hourly up to 300-400 mg
daily. Other drugs like chlorpromazine 25-50
mg IV 6 hourly and Methocarbamol (Robinex)
reduces muscle spasm.
Tracheostomy: If there are repeated spasms or
405 

7. 
8. 
9. laryngeal spasms, tracheostomy is done to bypass 
the upper airway. 
Mechanical ventilation: May be given in severe 
cases after paralyzing the respiratory muscles. 
Antibiotics: Higher antibiotics may be required 
for secondary bacterial infection. 
Prophylaxis: Tetanus toxoid is given at sixth, 
seventh and eighth months as one of the three 
components of triple vaccine. A booster dose is 
given at 2 yrs and subsequently every five yrs. 
50 > Rabies ----
Rabies is a fatal viral disease of the central nervous 
system following infected dog bite. It can also occur 
due to bite of other animals like cat, fox, wolf, etc. 
Management 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
406 Isolation: The suspected patient of rabies should 
be isolated in a quiet room with facilities for 
intensive care. Strict barrier nursing should be 
carried out to protect the nursing staff. 
For anxiety: The patient with rabies is conscious 
and aware of the impending death. He should be 
reassured and high doses of potent tranquilizers 
should be given. Usually diazepam 5-10 gm 6 
hourly is given. 
Nutrition: Hydrophobia prevents oral intake. 
Hence, on admission, even if the patient can 
swallow well, a Ryle's tube should be passed 
because, as the disease advances, spasms become 
more painful and passage ofRyle's tube becomes 
difficult. Through the Ryle's tube about 2000 
ml of fluids with about 2000 calories should be 
given in the form of fruit juices, rice kanji, milk, 
coconut water, soups, etc. 
Anti-rabies serum should be given if available. 
Prevention: 
a.Immunization of persons bitten by an
animal with anti-rabies vaccine may be
helpful even after the bite because oflong
incubation period.
b. Animals must also be immunized and
strict quarantine of stray animals must be
observed.PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
c.Human diploid cell culture rabies vaccine
should be given to the medical and nursing
staff in contact with the patient.
51 > Cerebral Malaria 
(Refer Pg. 91) 
52 > Acute Poisonings _ 
Management 
I.Removal of unabsorbed poison:
A.Ingested poison can be removed by:
1.Inducing vomiting with hypertonic
saline (if the patient is conscious and
cooperative).
2.Gastric lavage in unconscious and
uncooperative patients.
3.Cathartics if the patient is seen after
4 hours.
4.Bowel washes.
B.Inhaled: If the poison is inhaled:
1.The patient should be removed from
the contaminated atmosphere.
2.Fresh air or oxygen must be given.
C.Injected: For injected poison:
1.A tourniquet should be applied above
the site of injection.
2.The poison should be sucked by breast
pump.
II.Removal of absorbed poison:
In cases of poison excreted by the kidneys:
A.Increasing urinary output and changing the
pH to that which is optimal for excretion
of the poison.
B.Peritoneal and hemodialysis: Common
poisons which can be eliminated by this
mechanism are barbiturates, salicylates,
amphetamines, lithium, Mysoline,
carbamates, etc.
III.Antidotes:
A.Universal antidotes

3. Tannie acid Neutralizes alkalis Strong tea 
B.Specific antidote: These could be given for
certain poisons e.g.
1.Nalorphine for morphine
2.Oximes and atropine for organo
phosphorous compounds.
IV.Maintenance of vital functions:
A.Airway: Patent, functioning airway must
be maintained as follows:
1.Suction of throat and nasopharynx.
2.Insertion of oral airway.
3.Tracheostomy, if required.
4.Mechanical respirator, if there is
respiratory palsy.
B.Blood Pressure: If there is hypotension I. V.
fluids, plasma expanders, vasopressors and
corticosteroids may be given.
C.Acidosis must be corrected by 100 ml 7.5%
soda bicarb, intravenously.
D.Hydration, Nutrition and Electrolytes:
1.2000-2500 ml/day or fluids must be
given if urine output is about 1000-
2000 ml. It may be given as 5% glucose
or 5% glucose-saline.
2.40-60 mEq of potassium should also
be given.
E.Temperature: Hypothermia often occurs in
barbiturate poisoning. It can be treated by:
1.Warm blankets
2.Air-conditioned room and warming
of the inspired air
F.Urine:
1.Condom catheter in males to prevent
soiling of the bed
2.Self-retaining catheter if there is
urinary retention. Urinary infection,V. which commonly follows, must be 
treated 
G.Bowels: Enema should be given on alternate
days.
H.Skin:
1.Position 
should be changed often.
2.Daily sponging should be done and
spirit and talcum powder should be
used to harden the skin at pressure
points.
Symptomatic: 
A.Fever: It should be treated by anti-pyretic
agents like paracetamol and tepid sponging.
B.Pain: Analgesics like aspirin may be used.
C.Abdominal colic: Belladonna compounds
maybe used.
VI.Management of complications:
A.Due to poison.
B. Due to coma: Urinary tract infections,
respiratory infection, bedsores.
C.Due to therapy: Thrombophlebitis.
VII.Medical responsibilities.

for chemical analysis.
B.The police should be informed.
C. In case of death due to poisoning, an autopsy
must be asked for and the organs must be
sent for chemical analysis.
53 > Organophosphorous 
Com�ound Poisoning _ ------
Management 
I.Removal of unabsorbed poison by inducing
vomiting, hypertonic saline or gastric lavage.
II.Antidotes:
A.Atropine: Atropine counters the muscarinic
effects. It is available as 0.6 mg/ml (dilute)
and 6 mg/ml (concentrated) solutions.
Initially 5 cc of concentrated atropine is
taken in a syringe and slowly injected LV.
till signs of atropinization appear e.g. dry
407 

warm skin, dilated pupils, tachycardia, 
etc. Further I. V. dosage may then be 
abandoned and dilute atropine can be used 
for maintenance for the next 2 to 3 days. 
If signs of atropiniza-tion do not appear, 
concentrated atropine may be used. Signs 
of over-atropinization are restlessnes s, 
disorientation, delirium, irrelevant talk 
and hyperpyrexia. 
B.Oximes: Oximes counter the nicotinic
effects of organophosphorous poisoning
and should be used early when nicotinic
effects like fasciculations or paralysis are
present. They are of little value if given
after 24 hours. Pyridine-2- Aldoxime
Methiodine (PAM) the most commonly
available oxime is given in the dose of I gm
I. V. slowly and repeated after 30 minutes if
required.
III.Management of complications:
A.Pulmonary edema: This is common
complications and must be treated by
throat suction, oxygen, intravenous
furosemide 80-100 mg. atropine till signs
of atropinization and hydrocortisone 100-
200 mg.
B.Respiratory paralysis: Mechanical respirator.
C.Bronchopneumonia: Chloramphenicol or
ampicillin or 3rd generation cephalosporin
should be given l gm 8 hourly for 8-10
days ..
54 > Acute Alcoholic 
Intoxication 
Management 
I.Gastric lavage should be done to remove
unabsorbed alcohol.
II.Hypoglycemia should be corrected with 50
ml of 50% glucose I.V. along with vitamin B
complex especially thiamine. (Blood should be
collected for blood sugar estimation) prior to
the administration ofl.V. glucose).
III.Mannitol 350 ml of 20% solution can be given
IV if the patient fails to improve consciousness.
408 PRACTICAL MEDICIN E 
IV.If alcohol is contaminated with methyl alcohol:
The patient 
will have marked metabolic acidosis
which is treated by soda bicarb I. V. Hemodialysis
may be helpful.
V. If the patient develops delirium tremens: I.V 
glucose with vitamin B complex and sedatives 
e.g. diazepam are helpful.
VI.Treatment of associated complications
A.Antibiotics should be given for
bronchopneumonia.
B.Antacids and bland diet may be required
for gastritis.
N.B.: If an alcoholic continues to be comatose, in spite of
treatment, think of mixed poisoning, head injury 
or hepatic coma. 
55 > Barbit�rate Poisoning_ 
Management 
I.Assessment: The patient must be assessed
whether in mild, moderate or severe intoxication.
If mild or moderate no vigorous treatment is 
necessary. The patient must be observed for
deepening coma and analeptics; coffee and
caffeine may be given.
II.Airway must be kept patent as follows:
A.The tongue must be pulled forward.
B.Oxygen 30% is given as higher levels cause 
hypercapnia.
C.The airway must be cleared of all secretions
by suction.
D.Endotracheal intubation (E.T.) may be done
to maintain the patient's airway patent.
E.Tracheostomy and bronchoscopic suction
may be required if atelectasis is present or 
if ET is required for more than 48 hours.
F.Intermittent positive pressure respiration
is required, if severe respiratory depression
with cyanosis and dilated pupils occur.
III.Shock is treated by head low position, IV fluids,
blood and norepinephrine or mephentermine.
IV.Gastric lavage: It is to be given only if
recent ingestion, because barbiturates are
rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal

V. tract. Laryngospasm may complicate this 
procedure, which may be avoided by preliminar y 
endotracheal intubation. 
Forced alkaline diuresis: 
(To promote renal excretion of barbiturates) 
A.6-10 liters of 5% glucose-saline are given.
B.Mannitol 150-200 ml 2-3 times/day.
C.Furosemide 40-80 mg ifurine output is less
than fluid intake.
D.Soda bicarb 100 mEq 4-5 times
I. V. to alkalinize the blood, which
mobilizes barbiturates and facilitates
their excretion.
E.Electrolytes are to be given depending on
their serum levels.
F.Proper intake and output chart must be
maintained.
VI.General nursing care:
A.The bladder must be catheterized or a
condom catheter may be applied to have
an accurate measure of the urine.
B.The patient must be turned every 2 hours
and kept on his sides.
C.Care of the mouth, skin and eyes must be
taken.
VII. Dialysis: It is reserved for profound intoxication
especially if anuria or uremia develops.
56 > Acute Salicylate 
Poisoning ----------
Management 
I.Gastric Lavage: This should be done immediately
to remove as much salicylates as possible from
stomach.
II.Antacids: Aluminium hydroxide or milk2 hourly
drip through a nasogastric drip, slowly helps to
reduce gastric irritation.
III.Correction of metabolic disturbances:
A.Respiratory alkalosis: This could be treated
by l.V. 5% glucose-saline with 60-80 mEq
of KCl to correct hypokalemia.B.Metabolic acidosis: This could be treated by
l.V. sodium bicarbonate 7.5% 100-150 ml
depending upon the arterial pH.
IV.Symptomatic:
A.Tepid cold sponging should be done for 
hyperpyrexia.
B.Anticonvulsants like diazepam, paralde­
hyde, etc. are given if there are convulsions.
C.Calcium gluconate 20 ml I.V. is given if 
tetany is present.
V.Hemodialysis: To eliminate salicylates or if
acid-base imbalance cannot be corrected.
57 > Carbon Monoxide 
Poisoning __ _ 
Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning results from acci­
dental or suicidal inhalation of CO. The toxic effects of 
CO are due to its high affinity for hemoglobin, which 
is 200 times more than that of oxygen. 
Management 
I.First aid: The patient 
should be removed from his
environment immediately, the rescuer entering
the room in crouching position, holding his
breath in deep inspiration. The patient should be
immediately given mouth-to-mouth respiration.
2.Oxygen: As soon as it is available, 100%
oxygen should be given through the oronasal
mask. Hyperbaric oxygen (at 2 atmosphere
pressure) helps quicker dissociation of carboxy­
hemoglobin.
3. 
4. 
5. Respiration: Endotracheal intubation should
be done if required and the patient may be put
on a respirator.
Measures to reduce intracranial tension: Initial
hypoxia damages capillary endothelium and
causes cerebral edema. Mannitol, furosemide
and glycerol should be given (See raised
intracranial tension).
Miscellaneous: All clothing should be loosened.
Hypothermia may be used. Fluid and electrolyte
balance must be maintained.

58 Carbon Dioxide 
Narcosis 
Hypercapnia is defined as a PaC02 in excess of 45 
mm Hg at rest. Carbon dioxide narcosis occurs when 
PaC02 exceeds 90 mm Hg. 
Causes 
1.Central: Brain stem lesions, central sleep
apnea, neuromuscular (peripheral neuropathy,
myasthenia gravis, myopathies)
2.Chest wall: Kyphoscoliosis,ankylosisspondylitis,
trauma, pulmonary (chronic bronchitis,
emphysema)
Management 
1.Forced ventilation with intermittent positive
pressure respirator
2.Correction of acidosis and electrolyte
imbalance
3.Treatment of underlying disorder
4.Oxygen: This should be administered in a
controlled manner (about 2 litres/min) for
patients with chronic hypercapnia (e.g. COPD)
5.Drugs like morphine and sedatives should be
avoided in chronic hypercapnia.
59 Snake Bite 
There are about 400 species oflndian land snakes and 30 
species ofindian sea snakes. Of the land snakes, 40 are 
poisonous and of the sea snakes 29 are poisonous. The 
common poisonous land snakes are the cobra, Russell's 
viper, saw scaled viper, green pit viper, Echis and krait. 
The first two are responsible for most of the deaths. 
Management 
I. 
410 First aid 
1.Reassurance: The patient must be reassured
that every snakebite is not poisonous and
even if poisonous can be successfully
treated.
2.Immobilization of the part: The affected
part must be immobilized in a functional
position (by a splint and application of aPRACTICAL MEDICIN E 
crepe bandage) to reduce the rate of spread 
of the venom. NO incision or suction is 
recommended now. 
3.Tourniquet (only in cases of krait bite): The
site of bite should be lightly wiped by a
clean cloth and a band of clean cloth like
handkerchief2-4 cm. wide should be firmly
tied 5 cm. above the bite. The tourniquet
should be tight enough to occlude the
lymphatics but not the arterial or venous
circulation. It should be released every 15-
20 minutes for 1-2 minutes and reapplied
just proximal to the advancing edematous
area.
4.Transport: The patient must be transported
to the nearest medical centre. The snake
must be identified and preserved. If it is
dead it should be carried to the hospital
along with the patient.
II.Medical
1.On admission in hospital: An IV line should
be established, tetanus toxoid administered,
nursing in a lateral position continued, and
an anxiolytic drug given if required.
2.Mandatory observation of the patient for 24
hours for signs of systemic envenoming is
required since krait bite victims sometimes
show delayed onset of signs.
3.Anti-venom therapy: This is a life-saving
passive immunotherapy which would be
effective only if the venom is circulating
in the body and has not fixed to the tissues
resulting in specific toxic effects. Polyvalent
antivenom should be given intravenously
for its maximum effect, within 24 hours
of the bite. It is most effective within 4
hours, of less value after 8 hours and of
questionable value after 24 hours. The dose
of the anti-venom depends on the amount
of envenomation. It is given intravenously:
a.For local swelling but no systemic
symptoms: 20-50 ml.
b.Forsystemicsymptomsorhemorrhagic
abnormalities: 50-90 ml.
c.For severe systemic manifestation:
100-150 ml.

( 7 Medical Emergencies 
d. Larger doses are given to children
and underweight persons to
neutralize relatively higher venom
concentration. 1 ml of polyvalent
antivenom neutralizes 0.6 mg. of
cobra, 0.6 mg of viper and 0.45 mg
ofkrait and saw scaled viper venoms.
Monovalent sera are more specific
and more potent and should be used
if the snake has been identified.
Before administering the antivenom,
skin sensitivity test should always
be performed to avoid severe
anaphylaxis.
4.Antibiotics: Broad-spectrum antibiotics like
ampicillin, chloramphenicol or tetracycline
250 mg four times a day may be given to
check infection of the devitalized part
especially in viper bites.
5.Fluids, electrolytes, diuretics, pressoramines
are used judiciously for management of
hypovolemia, fluid overload and cardiac
complications.
6.Analgesics: This may be required for pain.
Aspirin 300 mg. three times a day with
antacids or dextropropoxyphene may
reduce the pain.
7.Blood constituents: In hypovolemia, plasma,
its substitutes or albumin may be given to
expand plasma volume. Red cells lost due
to lysis or bleeding may require packed
cells or whole blood.
8.Antihistaminics, Adrenaline and Steroids:
They have to be available to manage
anaphylaxis or 
allergic reaction occurring
due to the administration of antivenom.
III.Specific Treatment:
1.Neostigmine: In cobra-bite, 95% of the
offending toxins produce neuromuscular
block by acting on post junctional
membrane of motor end plate, similar
to curare, resulting in paralysis, which is
reversed by neostigmine. It is not effective
if the neuro-muscular block is complete.
Neostigmine should be given as soon as
the neurological signs appear and should
be continued till complete neurologicalrecovery. Premature discontinuation may 
lead to a relapse. Neostigmine 0.5 mg IV 
is given rvery half hour for six injections, 
and then if the symptoms have reduced, 
every hourly for three injections followed 
by one injection every 2-3 hours till all 
the signs of paralysis have disappeared. 
Each dose of neostigmine is preceded by 
0.6 mg of atropine IV. 
This treatment is not only highly effective, 
but also completely safe as there are no side 
effects. 
2.Heparin and coagulation factors are not
recommended now. 
3. Human fibrinogen: 300-600 gm is given
intravenously within the first 24 hours
of treatment after effective control of
clotting.
IV.Treatment of Complications
1. Shock: Hypovolemic shock is best treated
with 5% albumin, which is superior to
glucose or saline solutions. Dopamine
and corticosteroids are used if necessary
and electrolyte disturbances, if present,
are corrected.
2.Acute renal failure: Oliguria and hematuria
are the earliest signs. It is treated by
restoration offluid and electrolyte balance,
and administration of 300 cc of 20%
mannitol or 200-500 mg. of furosemide.
If renal shut down occurs, hemodialysis
may be required.
3.Respiratory failure: Respiratory muscle
paralysis leads to respirator y failure with
resultant hypoxia and hypercapnia. This
requires ventilation with a respirator or 
Ambu bag and proper control of blood
gases.
60 > Scor�_io_n_B_i_te ___ _
There are nearly 1000 species of scorpions and 86 
of them are found in India. The Indian red scorpion 
produces neurotoxic venom that is toxic to man. 
Palamnaeus gravimanus, also found in India, inflicts 
painful sting without systemic envenoming. 
411 

Management 
I.First Aid:
1.Cuts at sting site and tourniquet are not
advisable.
2.Local Pain can be relieved by application
of cold or ice over the site of sting.
II.Medical:
l.For Pain: If the pain is intolerable, local
anesthesia can be given using 2 % lignocaine
without adrenaline. Oral or sublingual
non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents
(NSAID) can also be given. In the past,
inj. dihydroemetine 60 mg/ampoule was
injected in the local site of the bite.
2.Oral diazepam is useful in relieving anxiety.
3.Correction of Dehydration: Dehydration
due to vomiting, salivation and sweating
should be corrected by continuous vigorous
oral rehydration solution. This helps to
correct initial hypotension and shock. IV
crystalloid solution or hydration by nasal
tube may be necessary in a confused,
agitated child.
4.Fluid replacement must be done since hypo­
volemia is one of the proposed mechanisms
of shock syndrome in scorpion sting.
5.Electrolyte imbalance should be corrected.
III.Scorpion Antivenin
This is available in India. It does not prevent or
protect the victim from development of severe
cardiovascular manifestations and it may give
anaphylaxis. The halflife ofantivenin is 11-102
times longer than venom and takes 45 minutes
to reach peak tissue concentration. It does not
prevent the autonomic storm. Recently it has
been reported that scorpion antivenin is no
better than a placebo.
IV.Specific Treatment:
412 l.Prazosin is a selective alpha-! adrenergic
receptor blocker. Its pharmacological
properties can antagonize the
hemodynamic, hormonal and metabolic
toxic effects of scorpion venom.
Dose: 125-250 µgin children and 500 µgPRACTICAL MEDICINE 
in adults; repeated 3 hourly until there 
are signs of clinical improvement in tissue 
perfusion i.e. warming of extremities, 
increase in urine out put, appearance of 
severe local pain at sting site which was 
absent or tolerable on arrival, disappearance 
of paresthesias, reduction or improvement 
in heart rate, pulmonary edema and 
reduction in raised blood pressure, and rise 
of blood pressure in hypotensives without 
hypovolemia. The dose should be repeated 
six hourly till extremities became dry and 
warm. If the initial dose has been vomited, 
prazosin dose should be repeated. 
In confused, agitated, non-cooperative 
children, prazosin should be administered 
by nasal tube after giving IV diazepam. 
First dose phenomenon is rare with this 
dose. However due care should be taken 
to avoid postural fall in blood pressure. 
Children should not be allowed to be lifted. 
Postural hypotension should be treated by 
giving head low position and IV fluids. 
V.Treatment of Complications:
1.Pulmonary Edema: In addition to prazosin,
patients should be given IV aminophylline 5
mg/kg diluted in dextrose as a slow bolus to
counteract the associated bronchospasm. If
available, isosorbide buccal spray is useful
or powder of nitroglycerine should be
rubbed on the gum. IV frusemide (10-20
mg) should be given to reduce the preload
and pulmonary congestion.
IV sodium nitroprussidedrip (SNP) 3-5 µg/
kg/min can be started and dose should be
raised continuously according to patient's
response. Blood pressure should be closely
monitored and maintained at the level
of systolic 80-90 mm Hg. SNP has to be
prepared from fresh powder every 4 hours,
the bottle and IV line should be protected
from light. At times a severe case may
require 15-36 hours of SNP drip to clear
pulmonary edema. Oral or injectable
cyanocobalamin can be given to avoid
cyanide toxicity whenever SNP is given for

( 7 ) Medical Emergencies 
long time. IV nitroglycerine can be used if 
SNP is not available. 
2.Shock!hypote nsion: Early administration
ofIV dobutamine 5-15 µg/kg/minute with
simultaneous SNP drip may be life saving.
3.DIC, subdural haematoma and hemiplegia
are known to occur and should be treated
with fresh blood transfusion.
4.Delirious or comatose patients may benefit
from hyperbaric oxygen.
5.Non-cardiac pulmonary or secretory
pulmonary edema or adult respiratory
distress syndrome are rarely seen due to red
scorpion envenomation but may necessitate
tracheal intubation and hyperventilation.
Hyperpyrexia is extremely high body temperature, 
which left untreated may damage various organs 
and results in death. Usually the rectal temperature 
is higher than 105°F and may be associated with
sweating, headache, dizziness, restlessness, confusion, 
convulsions and coma. 
Management 
I.Measures to reduce body temperature:
1.The patient should be transferred to an
air-conditioned room if available, and the
temperature of the room kept as low as
possible.
2.Tepid sponging with sheets soaked in cold
water should be started. Alternately, the
patient should be dipped in a bath of cold
water. Alcohol can be added to the cold
water bath as it helps to increase heat loss
from the body.
3.Ice water enema can be given to lower the
temperature.
4.Ice-cap should be placed on the head and
forehead should be frequently compressed
with ice.
5.Oxygen should be given at 6-8 liters/min.
with the help of nasal catheter.
6.Lyticcocktai1consistingof pethidine 100 mg,phenergan 50 mg and chlorpromazine 50 
mg is used to lower the body temperature. 
7.Aspirin capsule can be used per rectally.
II.Sedation: Phenobarbitone 30-60 mg three times
a day helps to relieve restlessness, convulsions
and reduce metabolic heat production.
III.Fluid and electrolyte balance should be
maintained. If there is dehydration, isotonic
saline should be given.
IV.Management of unconscious patient: If the
patient is unconscious. (Refer Coma Pg. 365).
62 Drowning 
Drowning is asphyxiation from submersion in water. If 
drowning is in fresh water, the aspirated water enters the 
circulation producing hemodilution, severe hemolysis 
and hyperkalemia. Ifit occurs in salt water, the aspirated 
fluid is hypertonic and hence causes diffusion of the 
blood into the alveoli resulting in pulmonary edema. 
Management 
I.Immediate treatment: Immediately after the
patient is rescued, respiratory support should
be given by clearing the airway and giving
mouth-to-mouth respiration. If the Ambo bag
is available it should be used. If available, oxygen
should also be administered.
If the carotid pulse is not palpable, an external
cardiac massage should be given.
The patient should be transferred to the
hospital and basic life support continued in the
ambulance. Even if respiration and circulation
are adequate, the patient must be hospitalized
for at least 48 hours for observation.
II.In the hospital
l.Respiration: The airway should be cleared
and a cuffed endotracheal tube should be
passed. Suction of throat and lung should be
done as required. If spontaneous ventilation
is absent or inadequate, intermittent
positive pressure respiration should be
given.
2.Circulation: In sea-water drowning,
413 

414 hypovolemia commonly occurs and hence 
theyshouldbe treatedwithplasmaexpanders 
like dextran. Ifhypotension persists in spite 
of adequate fluid replacement, vasopressors 
like mephentermine 60 mg intravenously 
or dopamine 0.2 mg in a drip of 500 ml 
should be given. 
3.Blood transfusion: Thisis required if there
is massive hemolysis and hemoglobin level
falls.PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
4.Alkali: Acidosis, which is usually present
should be corrected by 7.5% sodium
bicarbonate intravenously.
5.Diuretics: Furosemide40 -80 mg IV is useful
in pulmonary edema.
6.Steroids: Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV 8
hourly has been used in very ill patients
but is of doubtful value.
7.Antibiotics: Usually a broad spectrum
antibiotic like ampicillin or tetracycline
1-1.5 gm daily may be used to prevent or 
treat aspiration pneumonitis.

1 Introduction 
An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a graphic record of 
the electrical activity of the heart. 
The ECG paper is a specially prepared paper with 
small and large squares. The ECG paper moves at 
a rate such that in one minute 300 large square or 
1,500 small squares are covered. Thus 1 small square 
equals 0.04 sec. and one large square equals 0.20 sec. 
To calculate the heart rate, one must divide 1,500 by 
the number of small squares between two heartbeats. 
The vertical axis represents the voltage. One small 
square equals 0.1 m V. 
The normal ECG consists of P, Q, R, S, T and U waves. 
The P wave signifies atrial activity and it is normally an 
upright wave. It precedes the QRS complex. The QRS 
complex signifies ventricular depolarization. The Q 
wave is the negative deflection that precedes the R wave, 
whereas the S wave is the first negative deflection that 
follows the R wave. The R wave signifies ventricular 
repolarization and normally it is upright. The U wave 
is the positive deflection that follows the T wave. It 
probably represents re-polarisation of Purkinje's fibres, 
ventricular septum or slow ventricular repolarisation. 
The PR interval is the time taken for the impulse to go 
from the S.A. node to the ventricles. The QT interval is 
the time taken for the ventricular events-depolarization 
and repolarization. 
The ECG is reported as follows:

15.Conclusion
Voltage: There is no exact definition of normal voltage. 
Usually the Rand/or S wave in each lead varies from 
one to four or five big squares. 
Rate: Varies from 
60-120/min. 
Rhythm: Regular 
Axis: The normal mean frontal plane QRS axis lies 
between -30° and+ 100°. 
Position: The normal position is intermediate i.e. there 
is an R wave in both leads a VL and a VF. 
Rotation: Normally there is no clockwise or coun­
terclockwise rotation i.e. transition from S to R wave 
occurs between lead V2 and V4 
P wave: The normal P wave is not more than 0.25 m V 
in amplitude and not more than 0.12 sec duration. 
PR interval: The normal PR interval is between 0.12 
and 0.20 sec. 
QRS complex: In standard leads there is a dominant 
R wave. In lead V, there is a small r wave and big S 
wave. Gradually the R wave increases and the S wave 
decreases in amplitude from VI to V 6 
QRS duration: The normal QRS duration is from 
0.04 to 0.12 sec. 
ST segment: The normal ST segment is isoelectric. 
T wave: The T wave is normally inscribed in the same 
direction as the QRS complex. It is usually upright 
except in lead a VR and V 1• 

QT-c interval: Normal QT-c interval is from 0.35 to 
0.43 sec. 
U wave: Normally the U wave is absent or it may be 
just present. Its amplitude and duration are less than 
that of the T wave.

PWave 
The P wave is produced by atrial depolarization. 
This wave is best visualized in lead II and normally 
does not exceed 3 mm. in height (0.3 mV) or 3 mm 
horizontally (0.12 sec.). The P wave is upright in all 
leads except a VR. 
Abnormalities: The P wave is 
1.Absent in atrial fibrillation, nodal rhythm,
sinoatrial block and hyperkalemia.,--

e.Lutembacher's syndrome (MS with ASD)
f.Left atrial myxoma.
g.Cor triatrium
Inverted in Lead I in dextrocardia, incorrect 
electrode placement and retrograde atrial 
activation. 
QRSComplex 
The QRS complex is produced by ventricular depolar­
ization. It is a complex comprising of Q, Rand S waves. 
1.Q wave: The Q wave is the negative deflection that
precedes the R wave. It denotes depolarization
of the ventricular septum from left to right.
2.R wave: The R wave is the first positive deflection
of the QRS complex. It denotes depolarization of
the ventricles, at first the anteroseptal portion,
followed by the major ventricular muscle mass.
3.S wave: The S wave is the first negative deflection
of the QRS complex that follows the R wave. It
occurs due to depolarization of the posterobasal
part of the left ventricle, pulmonary con us and the 
uppermost part of the interventricular septum.
4.R' wave and S' waves: The R' wave is the second
positive wave of the QRS complex and the S'
wave is the second negative deflection of the
QRS complex after the R wave.
The relative heights of the QRS complex vary with 
the leads examined, the position of the heart and the 
degree of abnormality present. 

( 8 > Electrocardiography 
Voltage of QRS Complex 
Low Voltage: The QRS complex is the less than 5 
small squares in most of the leads. This occurs in 
pericardia/ effusion, myxedema, emphysema, and in 
some individuals with a thick chest wall. An erroneous 
low voltage may be recorded if the machine is placed 
on half standardization.

Fig 8 5 Low voltage 
High Voltage: This signifies ventricular hypertrophy. 
1.Left: The sum of the S wave in lead V 1 and R
wave in lead V6 would be more than 35 small
squares.
2.Right: There would be a tall R wave more than
7 small squares in lead V 1•
Axis 
The axis is determined by noting the QRS complex in leads 
land Ill. 
Left Axis Deviation is said to occur when the axis lies 
between -30° and -90° 
If there is a prominent R wave in lead I and a prominent 
S wave in lead III, it is left axis deviation. 
Causes 
1.Left ventricular hypertrophy
2.Left anterior hemi-block
3.During expiration
4.High diaphragm -ascites, obesity, pregnancy,

TWave 
The T wave is produced by ventricular repolarization. 
It is a smooth dome-shaped wave with two limbs 
asymmetrical, the peak being nearer the end than the 
beginning. It is normally upright, except in leads III, 
a VF, V1 and V2• 
Fig.8.7:lnvertedTwaves 1

i_ _ � F1g.8.8:TallTwa_ve� -· _ 
Abnormalities: The T wave is 
1.Inverted in myocardial ischemia. The two limbs of
the Twave become symmetrical with myocardial
infarction.
2.Flat in thick chest-walled individuals ,
emphysema, pericardia! effusion, myxedema,
myocarditis, myocardial ischemia, non­
penetrating chest injuries, hypokalemia,
hypocalcemia, hyperventilation and anxiety
state.
U Wave 
The U wave represents the slow repolarization of the 
Purkinje's fibers, the papillary muscles or the ventricu­
lar septum. It follows the T wave and precedes the P 
wave of the next cycle. It has the same polarity as the 
T wave and hence it is upright in most of the leads. 
U waves tend to be inverted in II, III, VI and V 2• It is 
transiently inverted during angina, acute pulmonary 
embolism, left ventricular overload and digitalis effect 
and sometimes in myocardial infarction. In myocardial 
infarction most of the changes may revert to normal 
and yet inverted U waves may persist. 
P-P and R-R Interval
When there is sinus rhythm, the P-P and R-R intervals 
are equal. They are used to calculate the heart rate. 
The P-P interval denotes the atrial rate and the R-R 
interval denotes the ventricular rate. 
Calculation of heart rate: In 1 minute, with the normal 
418 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
speed, 1500 small squares are covered. Hence if the 
P-P or R-R intervals is X and the heart rate/minute is
Y then if X squares cover 1 beat, 1500 squares cover
Y beat (heart rate/min).
1500 Y = --beats/min. 
X 
Thus the heart rate can be calculated by dividing 1500 
by the number of small squares between two consecu­
tive P or R waves. The R-R interval in the ECG below 
is 25. Thus the heart rate is 1500/25=60 beats/min. 
����
Fig. 8.1 O: Heart rate 60/min 
'- ---- --
PR Interval 
The PR interval is measured from the beginning of 
the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex and 
hence the term PQ interval is more accurate. It repre­
sents the time interval between atrial and ventricular

atrial depolarization, atrial repolarization and the 
delay of excitation in the AV node.

depolarization. It is measured from the beginning f 
the Q wave to the end of the S wave.

The upper limit of a normal QRS interval is 0.1 sec. 
Abnormalities: The QRS interval greater than 0.12 
seconds indicates bundle branch block or intraven­

Bundle Branch Block (BBB) 
Definition : BBB is a delay or block in conduction 
to the right or left main branch of the bundle of His. 
Diagnosis : BBB is diagnosed on an ECG by 
1.An abnormally prolonged QRS interval of0.12
sec. or more due to a delay in and an abnormal
spread of excitation through the ventricles.
2.The VAT is prolonged.

QT Interval 
The QT interval represents the duration of ventricular 
systole and is measured from the beginning of the Q 
wave to the end of the T wave. It varies with the heart 
rate. QT interval corrected for the heart rate is called 
QT-c interval. 
Normally QTc interval does not exceed 0.44 sec.

and cardiac syncope. PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
2.Decreased in hypercalcemia and following
digitalis and phenytoin sodium therapy. 
ST Segment 
The ST segment is measured from the ST junction to 
the beginning of the T wave. It is usually iso-electric 
but may be slightly depressed (0.5 mm) or elevated (0.2 
mm) in precordial leads. The depression or elevation
of the ST segment should be evaluated in relation to
the TP segment (i.e. the part between the end of the
T wave and beginning of the P wave of the following
cardiac cycle). It represents the time between ventricu­
lar depolarization and repolarization.
ST segment must not deviate more than 1 mm above or 
below isoelectric line in any lead. 
Abnormalities: The ST segment is 
1.Sagging in coronary artery disease.
2.Mirror image of correction mark in digitalis effect.
3.Depressed and convex upwards in strain pattern.
4.Raised with convexity upwards in myocardial
injury.
5.Raised with concavity upwards in pericarditis.

The ECG changes in ventricular hypertrophy are: 
1.Increased voltage: In ventricular hypertrophy
the muscle cells are not increased in number. The
action potential of a hypertrophied muscle cell
is not increased. However, the height of the QRS
complex is increased due to altered geometric
projection of the electrical forces.
2.WideQRS:TheQRSinterval increasesupto0.12

Sinus Rhythm 
The normal heart has sinus rhythm. The SA node is 
under the influence of the vagus nerve. Increased vagal 
tone decreases and decreased vagal tone increases the 
heart rate.

Sinus Arrhythmia 
Definition: Sinus arrhythmia is alternate periods of 
tachycardia and bradycardia which occurs due to an 
irregular discharge of the SA node associated with 
phases of respiration. Tachycardia occurs towards the 
end ofinspiration and bradycardia occurs towards the 
end of expiration. 
Mechanism: Reflex stimulation of the vagus nerve from 
the receptors in the lungs causes sinus arrhythmia. 
Diagnosis: PQRST complexes are normal but occur 
irregularly in relation to phases of respiration, so that 
the R-R interval varies. 
Significance: It is a normal physiological phenomenon, 
more marked in young persons. It is accentuated 
by vagotonic procedures like digitalis, carotid sinus 
or eyeball compression and abolished by vagolytic 
procedures like exercise, atropine and amyl nitrate. 
Supraventricular Premature Beats 
(SVPB) or Extrasystoles 
Definition: SVPB occurs due to a premature discharge 
of an ectopic focus, situated above the ventricles, either 
in the atrium or the AV node. 
Characteristics 
1.An atrial beat occurs prematurely so that P' wave
is recorded earlier than the anticipated P wave.
Inspiration Expiration 2. 
3. 
4. Premature atrial excitation leads to an alteration 
in the P wave and the PR interval as the impulse 
travels along unusual pathways. The P wave may 
be upright, inverted or diphasic. 
The premature beat usually initiates a ventricular 
complex which resembles the normal beat; 
hence the QRST complex of the premature beat 
resembles the Q RST complex of the normal beat. 
The compensatory pause is incomplete i.e. the 
sum total of the R-R intervals of the normal beat 
preceding and following a premature beat is not 
the normal R-R interval.

require no treatment except reassurance. If the cause is 
found, removal of the cause ( e.g. alcohol, smoking, thy­
rotoxicosis, etc.) would abolish extrasystoles. However, 
in heart diseases like mitral stenosis they may presage

atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia and

and later to a maintenance dose of0.25 mg once
a day. 
2.Quinidine: 0.2 gm three to four times daily orally.
3.Potassium salts, propranolol (40-120 mg daily)
or Diphenylhydantoin sodium (300 mg daily) if
the extrasystoles are induced by digitalis.
Paroxysmal Supraventricular 
Tachycardia (SVT) 
Definition: SVT is a series of three or more SVPBs 
which may occur for a few beats or continuously for 
several hours or days. The last beat of the series is fol­
lowed by a compensatory pause that is incomplete. Usu­
ally the rhythm is regular and at a rate of 150-250/ min. 
SVT is a narrow QRS complex tachycardia at rates 
between 150-250/min with sudden onset and sudden 
termination. 
F,g 8 24 Paroxymal supraventnculartachycard,a with rate 
187 min.The P waves have merged w,th the T v1aves of the 
preceding heat (P' wave) 
Mechanisms: There are 5 different mechanisms. 
1.A-V nodal re-entry
2.A-V nodal re-entry using a concealed extranodal
pathway
3.S.A. nodal re-entry
4.Intra-atrial re-entry
5.Automatic atrial tachycardia
The first two account for 90% of cases. The P wave 
occurs simultaneously with QRS and is hence not 
visible in A-V nodal re-entry. However, in A-V nodal 
re-entry with a concealed extranodal pathway, the 
P wave follows QRS complex. In SA nodal re-entry 
and intra-atrial re-entry, the P wave precedes QRS 
complex. In the former, its morphology is same as 
sinus P wave, whereas in the latter it is different. In 
automatic atrial tachycardia, there is a characteristic 
424 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
warm up phenomenon i.e. there is gradual acceleration 
at the onset of tachycardia and gradual slowing before 
termination of the tachycardia. A common example 
is PAT with block of digoxin toxicity. 
Diagnosis: SVT is continuous run of SVPBs, so that 
each P' wave is followed by a QRS complex. 
N.B.: The spread of the impulse through the atrial muscle
occurs more slowly than a normal sinus beat or SVPB.
Hence, the P-R interval is prolonged and the P' wave may
be obscured by the preceding QRS complex simulating
junctional tachycardia.
Causes: Same as SVPB. 
Significance: SVT may last for a few seconds to several 
days. It is usually benign and if without an underlying 
cause does not reduce life expectancy. Persistence of 
SVT in a patient with organic heart disease may lead to 
cardiac failure and coronary insufficiency. Persistence 
for a very long period, even in a normal individual, 
may cause cardiac failure. 
Treatment Principles 
1.A-V nodal re-entry, A-V nodal re-entry using a
concealed bypass tract or S-A re-entry usually
responds to mechanical measures to increase
vagal tone and drugs that slow ventricular rate
like verapamil, propranolol and digoxin.
2.Intra-atrial re-entry and automatic atrial
tachycardia are not usually terminated by
the above measures. The treatment of choice
is control of ventricular rate by verapamil,
propranolol or digoxin followed by either
quinidine or procainamide.
3.In PAT with block, digitalis must be withdrawn.
Treatment 
1.Mechanical measures to increase the vagal tone:
a)Carotid sinus massage, first on the right side
and then on the left side, for 3-5 seconds at
a time, may stimulate the vagus nerve and
abolish the tachycardia.
b)Self-induced gagging
c)Valsalva maneuver or Muller maneuver
terminates this tachycardia by stimulating
the vagus nerve, slowing conduction and
prolonging refractory period of A-V node....... 

( 8 > Electrocardiography 
2. d)The' duck-diving reflex': Ice water splashed
on the face or ice cubes in polythene bags
placed on the face.
Drugs: If mechanical measures fail, the following 
drugs may be useful: 
a)Verapamil 5 cc intravenously slowly often
dramatically abolished SVT. Once sinus
rhythm is established oral verapamil
40-120 mg three times a day may be given
to maintain the sinus rhythm.
b)Adenosine purine nucleoside IV 3 mg with
saline (Refer Ch. 15)
c)Esmolol, an ultrashort acting beta-blocker.
d)Digitalis, quinidine, propranolo/, diphenyl­
hydantoin sodium and potassium salts
as mentioned for SVPB are also useful.
Amiodarone or Disopyramide orally have
recently been found useful.
3.D.C. Shock: If mechanical methods and drugs
fail or if the patient is hemodynamically
unstable, cardioversion is achieved by selectively
synchronized direct current countershock.
Energies of 100-500 J. are usually successful.
Atrial Flutter and Fibrillation 
Definition: Atrial flutter is rapid and regular contrac­
tion of the heart at a rate about 220-350/min. Varying 
degrees of AV block lead to a much slower ventricular 
rate. The P waves of the atrial flutter have a saw-tooth 
appearance and are called flutter waves. 
Atrial fibrillation is a chaotic rhythm of the atria which 
causes small twitches of the atrial myocardium instead 
of an active atrial contraction which normally aids 
ventricular filling in the second rapid filling phase of 
the ventricular diastole. 
F,g 8 25 Atrial fibnllat,on 
--·---
Hemodynamic consequences: 
This depends on the patients underlying cardiac 
status and the ventricular rate. There is loss of atrial 
contribution to left ventricular filling which can reduce cardiac output especially in a person with diminished 
left ventricular compliance. 
A rapid ventricular response would reduce the diastolic 
filling which again can reduce cardiac output and cause 
hypotension, dizziness, and unconsciousness. Coro­
nary insufficiency may occur together with increased 
oxygen demand due to rapid rate. This may precipitate 
angina. Rapid rate can also precipitate cardiac failure 
and acute pulmonary edema.

2.P waves replaced by flutter waves
3.Ventricular rhythm usually regular, unless
there is a changing AV block
B.Atrial fibrillation
1.Irregularly irregular ventricular rhythm
425 

2.P waves replaced by fibrillation waves
3.Normal QRS complexes
At times the rhythm may alternate between flutter 
and fibrillation and a precise difference cannot be 
discerned. This is called "flutter fibrillation." 
�� 
Hemodynamic consequences 
The hemodynamic consequences of atrial fibrilla­
tion or flutter depend upon the patients' underlying 
cardiac status and the ventricular rate. With atrial 
fibrillation, the atrial kick of the second rapid filling 
phase of ventricular filling is absent with reduction 
of cardiac output especially in patients with reduced 
left ventricular compliance. A rapid ventricular rate 
would reduce the diastolic filling and further reduce 
the cardiac output. This may result in hypotension and 
reduced cerebral as well as coronary perfusion result­
ing in dizziness and angina. A rapid ventricular rate 
can cause cardiac failure or acute pulmonary edema 
especially in patients with mitral stenosis. 
Principles of Treatment 
I.To slow the ventricular rate
II.To restore sinus rhythm -Cardioversion
A)Bydrugs
B)By DC shock or pacing.
III.Anticoagulation and atrial fibrillation.
IV.To find out the cause and eliminate it.
Treatment 
I.Drugs to slow the ventricular rate: There
are three types:-Verapamil, Propranolol and
digoxin. The onset of action of intravenous
verapamil and propranolol is more rapid than
that of intravenous digoxin. However, the half­
life of digoxin is longer. Again with cardiac failure
verapamil and propranolol should not be used.
426 l Digoxin: This is given in the dose of 0.25
mg IV followed by repeat doses of0.25 mg/
day. 
2. Beta-blocker: Propranolol is given in thePRACTICAL MEDICINE 
dose of 1 mg over 1 minute. The dose can 
be repeated every 5 minutes to a total dose 
of 0.15 mg/kg. Even metoprolol, atenolol 
or esmolol can be used, provided the L V 
function is good. 
3.Verapamil: This is given in the dose of
5-10 mg IV over 1-2 minutes. If there is
no response, a repeat dose of 10 mg IV
can be given after 20 minutes. If the initial
response of ventricular slowing is short
lived, a continuous infusion can be used
intra-venously in the dose of 5 mcg/kg/
min. Orally 40 mg tds up to 120 mg tds can
be added to digoxin even ifLV function is 
poor.
4.Amidarone
II.A) Drug Cardioversion : Drugs to convert
atrial fibrillation: Once the ventricular rate 
is controlled, conversion to sinus rhythm 
can be attempted. Some patients with atrial 
flutter may convert to sinus rhythm with 
verapamil alone. However, oral quinidine 
or procainamide can be used for chemical 
conversion. They slow the con-duction 
and prolong refractory period of the atria. 
However, if the ventricular rate has not been 
controlled first, they may increase the heart 
rate due to a vagolytic effect on the A-V 
node and slowing of the atrial flutter rate, 
both of which increase the A-V conduction. 
I.Quinidine: This is given orally in
the dose of 200 mg every 2 hours
for 2-3 doses followed by 200
mg every 6 hourly. In successful
cases, usually the conversion occurs
by second or third dose. If atrial
fibrillation is long standing, over 12
months, or left atrium is markedly
dilated, cardioversion should not be
attempted because sinus rhythm is
usually not maintained.
2.Procainamide: This is given in the
dose of 0.25 gm every 2 hours up to 
3 doses followed by 0.25 gm 6 hourly.
Usually quinidine is preferred to this
drug.

( 8 ) Electrocardiography 
II. 3.Flecainide: 2 mg/kg IV over 10 mins.
4.Disopyramide 50-150 mg IV slowly.
5.Amiodorone: 200-400 mg tds.
B)DC Current or Pacing
1.Direct current (DC) cardioversion:
If the patient has hypotension, loss
of consciousness or pulmonar y
edema, the treatment of choice is
cardioversion with electric shock
synchronized to the QRS complex
(to avoid inducing ventricular
tachycardia or fibrillation). Initially
energy of 50-100 J is given and
repeated up to 400 J. This usually
helps to reset the rhythm to sinus or
at least slows down the ventricular
rate, which then can be treated with
drugs.
2.Rapid atrial pacing: This can be done
in patients of atrial flutter who are
hemodynamically stable. The atrial
pacing conversion is attempted
with the electrode in the right atrial
appendage or high right atrium
with rapid pacing at rates faster
than the flutter rate. This may result
in conversion to the sinus or atrial
fibrillation, or increase in flutter rate.
III.Anticoagulation and AF:
Patients with mitral stenosis, cardiomyopathy
and history of systemic thromboembolism, who
are at a high risk for systemic embolism, must
be anticoagulated with heparin.
Ventricular Premature Beat or 
Extrasystole (VPB) 
Definition: VPB occurs due to premature discharge 
of an ectopic focus in the ventricles. 
F1g.8 27 :Ventricular premature beats . -Characteristics 
1.The beat arises prematurely.
2. 
3. 
4. Since the impulse originates in the ventricles and
does not activate the atria, P wave is absent.
The QRS complex is wide, bizarre and tall, with
T waves in the opposite direction as the major
deflection of the QRS complex i.e. if the R wave
is prominent, the T wave is inverted and if the
S wave is prominent, the T wave is upright.
The compensatory pause is complete because
VPB does not depolarize the SA node. The
impulse from the SA node following a VPB does
not active the ventricles as they will be in the
refractory period. The ventricles will respond
only to the next sinus impulse and hence the
interval between the two sinus beats preceding
and following the VPB will be exactly twice the
normal interval between two sinus beats.
Types 
A.VPBs in 24 hour ECG tracing
B.VPBs following myocardial infarction
Significance: An extrasystole can occur in a normal 
person without any lesion of the heart. Usually it is 
benign and of no significance. However, it is significant 
if Lawn's criteria are fulfilled: 
1.It occurs for the first time after the age of 40.
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
7. It is associated with a heart lesion. 
It is multifocal. 
It occurs more than 5 times per minute. 
There is R on T phenomenon. 
It occurs in salvos of 2 or more. 
It occurs following exercise. 
Causes: Same as SVPB. 
Treatment: Same as SVPB. 
Paroxysmal VentricularTachycardia (VT) 
Definition: VT is a series of three or more VPBs which 
may occur for a few beats or continuously for several 
hours or days. The last beat of the series is followed 
by a compensatory pause that is complete. Usually the 
rhythm is regular at 160-200/min.

Ventricular Fibrillation and Flutter 
Definition: Ventricular fibrillation is a disorganized 
and chaotic activity of the heart, which results in ir­
regular and deformed deflections of varying height, 
width and shape. This condition is terminal unless 
cardioverted. 
�EH1� 
Ventricular flutter is a very rapid and regular ectopic 
ventricular discharge with an abnormal intraventricu­
lar conduction resulting in a wide, bizarre and sine-like 
QRS complex fused with the T wave.

Causes: 
1. 
2. 
3. Coronary heart disease 
Drugs: Digitalis, adrenaline and anesthesia 
During cardiac surgery, due to hypoxia 
4.Hypothermia
5.Electric shock
Diagnosis: Bizarre ventricular pattern of different 
shapes and sizes. 

( 8 ) Electrocardiography 
Treatment: 
1.D. C. Shock and cardioversion. This is started with
200 J. Ifit is unsuccessful, a second shockof200
J is given immediately. If this is also unsuccessful
a maximum of 320-400 J are given.
2.Intravenous Xylocaine 100 mg bolus and 200 mg
in a drip.
3.Intravenous propranolol 5-10 mg.
Torsade de Pointes (Polymorphic VT) 
Torsade de Pointes is a ventricular arrhythmia char­
acterized by QRS complexes of changing amplitude 
with a characteristic twisting around the isoelectric 
line on ECG. The rate is around 200-250/min. It may 
revert spontaneously to sinus rhythm or degenerate 
to ventricular fibrillation. It occurs in the setting of 
prolonged QT interval. 
Causes 
1.Congenital QT prolongation
2.Drugs: Quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide,
prenylamine phenothiazine, tricyclic
antidepressants and overdose of lidocaine.
3. Electrolyte disturbances: Hypoka lemia,
hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia
4.Cardiac lesions: Myocarditis, Mitral valve
prolapse.
5.Bradyarrhythmias
6.CNS: Subarachnoid hemorrhage
7.Miscellaneous: Organophosphorous and arsenic
poisoning, liquid protein diet, anorexia nervosa.
Treatment there is ventricular fibrillation, DC cardioversion 
is usually required. 
5.Isoproterenol/ Isoprenaline 2-6 mcg/min may be
used until temporary pacemaker can be inserted.
In some cases, Bretylium and lidocaine has been
successfully used.
6. IV Magnesium has been used even when
magnesium levels have been normal.
7 > Conduction Defects 
Atrioventricular Block 
(AV Block) 
DEFINITION: AV block is disturbance in the conduc­
tion of the atrial impulses through the AV conducting 
system. 
Classification 
A.Incomplete
1.First degree AV block: Delay in AV
conduction.
2.Second degree AV block: Intermittent
interruption of AV conduction.
B.Complete or third degree AV block: Complete
interruption of AV conduction.
First Degree AV Block 
There is a delay in conduction of every impulse passing 
through the AV node. This results in prolongation of 
the PR interval to above 0.2 seconds. The rhythm is 
regular and no beat is dropped. 
Causes 
1.Elimination of precipitating cause or stop culprit

Second Degree AV Block 
Second degree AV block is an intermittent interrup­
tion of AV conduction so that some of the impulses 
are conducted to the ventricles and others are blocked. 
It may be of the following types. 
1.Wenckebach type (Mobitz type I): Here there is a
gradual increase in the PR interval in subsequent
beats till one beat is completely blocked and
therefore that P wave is not followed by a QRS
complex. The pause due to the dropped beat
allows the conducting system to recover. A
normal PR interval and a gradual increase in
the PR interval with every beat follow in a cyclic
fashion, till once again a beat is dropped. It may
respond to atropine. Temporary pacing is often
done.
2.Mobitz type II: Here, the ventricle fails to
respond to the atrial contraction periodically.
This may occur at a regular or irregular interval so
that for a particularnumber of QRS (ventricular)
complexes there may be correspondingly more P
(atrial) waves e.g. if for 5 QRS complexes there are
6 P waves, it is known as a 6:5 block. It usually
needs pacing.
3.Constant block: Here there is a fixed AV
relationship. Thus for every 2 or more P waves
(atrial activity) there is one QRS complex
(ventricular activity) e.g. If after every third P
wave there is one QRS complex it is a 3: 1 block.
Causes 
1.Acute rheumatic carditis
2.Coronary heart disease
3.Diphtheria! carditis
4.Drugs: Digitalis
5.As a protective mechanism with fast
supraventric ular rhythms e.g. atrial tachycardia,
atrial flutter.
430 Third Degree AV Block 
(Complete AV Block) 
There is a permanent interruption of AV conduction 
so that all supraventricular impulses are blocked. Ven­
tricles are activated by a subsidiary ectopic pacemaker 
and therefore there is no relationship between atrial 
and ventricular pacemakers. These two rhythms are 
asynchronous. Hence P waves and QRS complexes 
occur at a different but constant rate. The rate of the 
QRS complex is almost half that of the P wave. 
Causes 
1.Inferior wall myocardial infarction due to Right
coronary occlusion.
2.Congenital complete AV block
3.Coronary heart disease
4.Congenital heart diseases: Ostium prim um type
ofASD,VSD
5.Drugs: Digitalis, quinidine, procainamide

Electrol }1_es ____ _
Digitalis 
Digitalis Effect 
A patient on digitalis may have certain changes in his 
ECG as adequate digitalization is reached. They do 
not indicate the need to reduce the dose of digitalis. 
These changes are: 
1.The ST segment is depressed, rounded and

( 8 } Electrocardiography 
2. concave (scooped). The T wave is dragged 
downwards giving an appearance of T wave 
inversion. These ST-T changes occurring in leads 
with a prominent R wave suggest a therapeutic 
effect. However, if these changes occur in leads 
with mainly a negative QRS complex, it indicates 
that the drug is causing relative subendocardial 
coronary insufficiency and therefore the drug 
must be stopped. 
The QT interval is shortened due to the 
shortening of the ventricular systole.

DIGITALIS TOXICITY: The toxic effects of digitalis 
may be as follows: 
1.Sinus bradycardia
2.Premature beats -unifocal, multifocal or
bigeminy
3. 
4. 
5. Supraventricular arrhythmias -paroxysmal atrial
tachycardia, atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation
Ventricular arrhythmias -ventriculartachycardia,
ventricular flutter and ventricular fibrillation

and bundle branch block
Quinidine 
QUINIDINE EFFECT: Quinidine produces ST de­
pression and flattening of the T wave like digitalis, but 
unlike digitalis there is an increased QT interval and 
the T wave may be notched and widened. 
QUINIDINE TOXICITY: The toxic effects of quini­
dine may be as follows: 
1.SA block.
2.First, second or third degree AV block.
3.Bundle branch block: QRS complex gradually
widens and blends with the T wave giving a
wide, bizarre, biphasic deflection
4.Ventricular arrhythmias -idioventricularrhythm, ventricular premature beats, ventricular 
tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation and cardiac 
asystole. 
5.AV junctional rhythm.

ECG changes with gradual rise in potassium are as

1.Peaked, tall and tented Twaves (This also occurs
in posterior wall myocardial infarction)
2.The amplitude of the P wave decreases and
finally disappears completely because though
the sinoatrial node fires an impulse, the atrial
myocardium is not activated

1 > X-ray Ch_e_st __ 
An X-ray of the chest is normally taken anteropos­
teriorly or postero-anteriorly, depending upon the 
direction of the rays from a source to the plate. The 
postero-anterior (P.A.) view is the common view in 
use, because the heart size is less exaggerated and hence 
more normal than in the anteroposterior (A.P.) view. 
Normally the chest X-ray is well centralized so that 
both the clavicles are at the same level. It they are not 
at the same level the X-ray is poorly centralized. 
If the breast shadows are visualized, the plate is of a 
female patient. 
The right diaphragm is slightly higher than the left 
with clear costophrenic and cardiophrenic angles. 
The rib cage and clavicles are normally well visualized. 
The cardiac shadow consists of a smooth right border 
formed by the superior vena cava, right atrium and 
inferior vena cava. The left border is formed by aortic 
knuckles, pulmonary artery, left atrial appendage, right 
ventricle and left ventricle, from above downwards. The 
ratio of the chest wall to the cardiac shadow is 2: 1; if 
there is cardiac enlargement this ratio becomes less. 
It is slightly increased in emphysema. 
The aortic knuckle is prominent in aortitis, atheroscle­
rosis or aneurysm. The pulmonary artery is prominent 
in pulmonary hypertension. The pulmonary artery 
shadow is absent in pulmonary stenosis or pulmonary 
atresia. 
In right atrial enlargement there is a straightening of 
the left border and double density of the two atria. 
In right ventricular enlargement the cardiac shadow 
enlarges outwards, but in left ventricular enlargement 
the cardiac shadow enlarges outwards and downwards, 
having boot-shaped configuration. The lung shadows are visualized next. Normally they 
are translucent. It is important to look for radio-opaque 
shadows or hyper translucency in the lung shadow. 
Most of the vascular shadows ( white linear) in the lung 
fields are due to branches of the pulmonary artery. They 
are usually accompanied bya corresponding branch of 
the bronchus. The pulmonary arteries form the major 
bulk of the hilar density. In contrast, pulmonary veins 
have low density. They may be seen in the upper lobes 
just lateral to the upper lobe artery. The lymphatics, 
interstitium, alveoli and pleura cast a very low density 
and are difficult to identify.

the loops have thick walls because of the gross edema 
and the gas transradiancies in adjacent loops may be 
separated by 1 cm wide areas of opacity.

Preparation 
Three days preceding the investigation, the patient is 
put on a low-residue diet. The patient is given deflatu­
lant medication like methyl polysiloxane or activated 
charcoal and mild purgation e.g. bisacodyl or castoroil 
on the night previous to the day of procedure. Patient 
is kept fasting overnight. 
TECHNIQUE: AP view of abdomen is taken while 
the patient is in a state of full inspiration. Another 
antero-posterior view is taken by centering the tube 
on pubic symphysis. Alternatively both the areas may 
be covered in the same film.

the vertebral column. The kidneys are situated opposite 
the second lumbar vertebra lateral to psoas shadow, 
the right kidney is slightly lower than the left one. 
Kidneys are bean shaped structures with the concave 
hilum facing the vertebral column. Normally they 
measure 4" X 3" X l". 
The delineation of kidneys is due to the contrast 
provided by the translucency of perirenal fat. In very 
thin individuals and old men, the kidneys may not 
be well visualized. Poor preparation also will obscure 
kidney shadows. 
In case of acute pyelonephritis the psoas and kidney 
shadows may appear fuzzy.

There can be unilateral agenesis of kidney causing 
absence of renal shadow on that side. Alternatively 
the kidney may be ectopic (e.g. Pelvic).

by taking lateral X-ray in which the shadow will fall 
on the vertebral column.

'IVP' (Intravenous Pyelography) or 
Excretory Urography 
Principle : Sodium iothalamalate is a radiologic 
contrast material containing iodine which is selec­
tively excreted by glomerular filtration, which is not 
reabsorbed. 
Preparation is similar as for KUB. 
Technique: Before injecting the dye, iodine sensitiv­
ity should be checked. Anti-histaminics, adrenaline, 
hydrocortisone and oxygen should be available along 
with other resuscitative equipment. The patient should 
be asked not to take water after the previous evening, 
to obtain a good contrast. However, patients with 
diabetes, myeloma, old age and compromised renal 
function should be well hydrated to avoid nephro­
toxicity due to the contrast medium. If the patient is 
on diuretics they should be omitted for 3 days prior 
to the procedure, lest the contrast be poor. 
'KUB' is done as a pilot procedure to assure that the 
preparation is adequate. 
Abdominal binder is applied tightly enough to com­
press the ureters. Twenty to 40 ml of contrast medium 
along with an antihistaminic is injected slowly intra­
venously. Abdominal radiographs are taken at l, 3, 5, 
10, 15 and 30 minutes, the binder is then released and 
at 45 minutes, 'prone' and standing films are taken. 
Bladder is picturized when the patient gets a sensation 
of fullness and desire to empty it. 
A radiogram is taken immediately after evacuation 
of the bladder. 
Interpretation 
1.Promptness of appearance of nephrogram:
442 Normally a good nephrogram should be seen
in one minute film. Nephrogram is delayed and
contrast is poor if renal functions are impaired.
Late appearance of nephrogram and hyper
concentration is seen in the kidney with renal
artery stenosis. A congenitally small kidney isPRACTICAL MEDICINE 
small in size. There is no delay in appearanc e of 
nephrogram. 
Nephrogram will appear late, persist for 
longer time and will progressively show hyper 
concentration in acutely obstructed kidney 
which previously had good function. 
2.Kidneys: The kidneys are normally situated
on either side of the vertebral column between
LI and L4 vertebrae. They are bean shaped
structures and smooth in outline. The surface
would show indentations left by some old scar of
pyelonephritis. Fetal lobulations would be seen,
if present. Polycystic kidney would show bumpy 
outline and stretched calyces. Cysts would cast
a negative shadow.
3.Pelvocalyceal system: The corners of the calyces
would appear nipped off in renal tuberculosis.
There may be pyelotubular reflux especially
at the upper and lower-pole calyces. In acute
papillary necrosis, sloughed out papilla may
cast a negative shadow. The calyces will show
progressive blunting and ultimately clubbing in
hydronephrosis. Oblique view may be taken for
posteriorly situated calyces.
4.Ureters: Uretersmaybedilatedinh ydronephrosis.
They also may look dilated with the use of
anti-spasmodics, oral contraceptives and
during pregnancy. They would look spastic
with infection. They would look narrow and
pulled towards vertebral column in case of
retroperitoneal fibrosis. The beaded appearance
occurs in renal tuberculosis and ureteritis cystica.
Both may present with painless hematuria,
however in the latter condition, there is no
deformity of calyces.
5.Bladder: A thimble bladder is seen with spastic
bladder and chronic or tuberculous cystitis.
In women, bladder capacity is often large. A
paralytic bladder has a large size. The bladder
neck would be elevated and with convex
indentation due to prostate enlargement.
Trabeculations and diverticula are seen with
bladder neck obstruction and spastic bladder.
Diverticula may be congenital or may develop
in flaccid atonic bladder which had been poorly
drained. Neoplasms may show filling defects.

5 Barium Studies 
Details of the gastrointestinal tract can be studied if 
the gastrointestinal tract is filled with radio-opaque 
substance like barium. 
For the barium meal, the patient swallows a suspension 
of radio-opaque barium sulfate, whilst the radiologist 
observes its passage on the fluorescent screen, or on the 
TV monitor of an image intensifier. Films are taken 
to provide a permanent record of any abnormality 
discovered. The barium enema is used in the diagnosis 
of diseases of the large intestine and rectum. Barium 
suspension is introduced into the rectum as an enema 
and manipulated around the colon to the cecum. 
Esophageal Varices 
Situation: In the submucous and subepithelial layers 
by anastomosis of left gastric and short gastric veins 
with the esophageal veins. 
Causes: 
1.Portal hypertension
2.Cirrhosis of liver
3.Transiently in viral hepatitis
4.Alcoholic
Mechanism: The exact mechanism is not known. Withinspiration the portal to esophageal venous pressure 
falls, hence blood flows from portal to esophageal veins 
which become varicose because of poor submucosal 
support. 
Appearance 
1.On esophagoscopy: Blue rounded projections
under the mucosa.
2.On barium swallow: Long thin, evenly spaced
lines of normal mucosa disturbed by the varices
as filling defects in the regular contour of the
esophagus.
Hiatus Hernia 
1. 
2. On plain X-ray a ring shadow containing a fluid 
level and superimposed on the cardiac shadow. 
Barium studies show esophagus and the cardiac 
end of the stomach protruding up through the 
normal hiatus.

Gastric Ulcer 
1.A constant projection from the main barium
shadow in the stomach due to ulcer crater. It is 
conical with apex pointing outwards from the
stomach.
2.Some small craters and those below the incisura
ulnaris may be seen as small spherical opacities
surrounded by a trans radiant zone. There may be
some deformity or interruption of rugal pattern
nearby due to surrounding edema. The average
gastric ulcer crater will be invisible radiologically
after about 4 weeks. However, healing takes about
6 weeks. A recurrent ulcer crater on a new site
will probably heal with greater ease than one on
the old site, where scar tissue and poor blood
supply will be factors delaying healing.
Duodenal Ulcer 
1.Deformity of the duodenal cap may be caused by
an ulcer crater, edema, fibrosis, muscular spasm
or a combination of these lesions.
2.Barium in the crater may appear as a niche
projection from the general contour of the cap,
if it is seen tangentially.

< 9 > Radiology 
3. 
4. 
5. Ifit is seen en face after compression, it appears as 
an isolated spot, the surrounding edema causing 
a translucent area. 
If the ulcer is chronic, the rugae may converge 
towards it giving a stellate appearance. 
If the ulcer is large, barium may remain in the 
crater after the rest of the cap has emptied. 
Pyloric Stenosis 
1.Large excess of resting gastric fluid, 6 hours after
fasting.2.Slow initial emptying of stomach after barium
meal, in spite of periods of vigorous peristalsis.
Slow final emptying with a large barium residue
after 6 hours.
3.In severe cases, stomach is dilated.
Causes of Delayed Gastric Emptying 
1.Pyloric stenosis
2.Physiological upset following vomiting caused
by distaste for barium
3.Emotional upset due to grief, anxiety or even
upsets associated with asthma and migraine
Carcinoma of the Stomach 
1.A primary neoplast ic ulcer is often
indistinguishable from a simple ulcer.
2.Filling defect in the barium shadow or a thumb
mark type of defect by a large fungating mass
3.Hour glass stomach due to annular constricting
type of growth
4.Narrow irregular gastric outline due to
submucous, diffuse, infiltrating neoplasm

6 > X-rai of Bones 
X-ray of the bone must be viewed as follows:
A.Soft Tissues: Swelling or muscle wasting.
B.Bony Surfaces
1.Periosteal new-bone formation: This is seen
as a linear density, parallel to the cortex. It
is seen in healing scurvy, hypervitaminosis
A and D and infantile cortical hyperostosis.
2.Juxta-articular erosions
3.Diffuse cortical resorption: This is the
typical loss of diaphyseal cortex seen in
hyper-parathyroidism
C.Shape and Size of the Bone: Fractures, dislocation
and congenital anomalies.
D.Internal Structure of the Bone: Mineralization,
localized destruction, etc.
Osteomyelitis 
A.Acute Osteomyelitis:
1.Slight focal decalcification
2.Soft-tissue swelling
3.Faint periosteal new-bone formation
B.Chronic Osteomyelitis:1.Bone destruction with 
sclerotic reaction
2.Sequestrum: Dense, devascularized
bony fragments lying within the pus and
granulation
3.Involucrum: Peripheral shell of new
supporting bone laid down by the
periosteum
Tuberculosis of Bone 
1.Diffuse loss of density of bone
2. 
3. 
4. Slight diminution in joint space
Trabeculae become indistinct and cortex is
thinned out
Periosteal new-bone formation is absent and
there is no massive sequestrum formation

5. Wedge shaped collapse and angular kyphosis
Two affected vertebrae fuse into single wedge
shaped bone.
Aneurysmal Bone Cyst 
These are seen in several disorders. It usually indicates 
an autonomous parathyroid gland (primary or tertiary 
hyperparathyroidism). 
447 

Scurvy 
In scurvy there is adequate calcium but lack of osteoid 
tissue. 
1.Epiphysis: The epiphysis has a dense margin
with radiolucent centre ( ring sign or halo sign of
Wimberger).
2. 
3. 
4. Metaphysis: the white line of metaphysis is wider
than normal. 'Scurvy zone' lies between the bone
and the white line.
Diaphysis: There is uniform demineralization
of the bone. The cortex is thinned out giving the
bone a uniformed ground-glass appearance with
penciled outline. Angular lateral bony spurs are
present. These are defects in the cortex at the
junction of diaphysis and metaphysis ( angle sign).
Subperiosteal hemorrhages may occur which
may lift the periosteum. It may calcify sometimes.
Rickets 
1.Epiphysis: The epiphysis lacks a bony cortical
margin and appears indistinct. There may be
epiphyseal separation which is more common
in renal rickets.
2.Metaphysis: The metaphysis is splayed out

1 > Endotracheal Tube 
Fig 10 1 · Endotracheal tubew1th a cuff 
-- ---- - ------
It is a tube made oflndia Rubber, Port ex (polyethylene) 
or Polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The Portex and PVC 
tubes are softer and less irritant to the mucosa. They 
have a radio-opaque line along their length to assess 
the exact location of the tube. The tube has a smooth 
atraumatic tip. Theendofthetubeisbeveled. The bevel 
usually faces left. There is also a sub terminal opening 
(eye) on the right in order to inflate the right lung. 
There is a 1 cm graduation along the tube to indicate 
the depth of insertion. There is also a 2 cm mark ( called 
the Vocal Cord Guide) at the distal end which helps in 
placement of the tube beyond the vocal cords. 
The endotracheal tube may be cuffed or uncuffed. 
The cuffed tubes have a cuff at the distal end which 
can be inflated through a smaller tube which runs 
alongside the endotracheal tube or is embedded in 
its wall. There is also a pilot balloon with a one-way 
valve on the proximal end of the smaller tube which 
helps to assess the pressure of air injected into the cuff. 
Endotracheal tubes may be for oral or nasal insertion. 
Sizes 
The size indicates the internal diameter of the tube in 
mm. Uncuffed tubes are available in sizes2.5 to 10.0 mmwith 0.5 mm increments. The cuffed tubes are avail­
able in 4.0 to 10.0 mm sizes with 0.5mm increments. 
Sterilization 
The India Rubber tubes can be boiled or autoclaved. 
The PVC or Portex tubes are available in gamma ir­
radiated packs for single use. 
Uses 
1.Cardiopulmonary arrest to carry out artificial
respiration
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. Respiratory failure due to severe pneumonia,
chronic obstructive lung disease and respiratory
muscle paralysis (Gullian Barre syndrome,
myasthenia gravis, bulbar poliomyelitis, etc.)
To secure the airway and clear secretions to
prevent aspiration in unconscious patients
To administer general anesthesia.
To suction the trachea in newborns in case of
meconium aspiration
Method 
The patient is kept in supine position with the cervi­
cal spine flexed and the head extended at the atlanto 
occipital joint. Standing at the head of the patient, 
the laryngoscope is inserted into the oral cavity and 
the vocal cords are visualised. The Endotracheal tube 
(with the cuff deflated), with the bevel facing left, is 
inserted through the vocal cords until the cuff passes 
through the cords. The Ambu bag is now connected 
to the endotracheal tube and ventilation is started. 
Bilateral air entry is checked for by 5 point ausculta­
tion (left and right anterior chest wall, left and right 
lateral chest wall and epigastrium). 
If there is bilateral equal air entry, the cuff is inflated 
with 3-4 cc of air and the endotracheal tube is fixed with 

adhesive tape to the comer of the mouth. An airway or 
mouth gag is inserted to prevent biting of the tube and 
also facilitate suctioning of secretions. 
If bilateral equal air entry is not achieved, the tube is 
withdrawn by a few centimeters and rechecked. The 
tube might be in a bronchus (more often the right 
bronchus since it is shorter, wider and more vertical 
than the left). If bilateral equal air entry is still not 
achieved, the endotracheal tube should be withdrawn 
and reinserted. The tube was probably in the esopha­
gus (no air entry bilaterally on chest auscultation and 
gurgling or bubbling sound in the epigastrium cor­
responding with the ambu bag ventilations). 
Nasal V/s Oral Insertion 
Advantages of Nasal Insertion: 
•Does not obstruct the surgeons operative field
in oro-facial operations
Oral feeding is possible
Biting of the tube does not occur
Disadvantages of Nasal Insertion: 
Blind insertion 
Nasal trauma 
•Infection more common
Advantages of the Cuff 
It provides a seal between the tracheal wall and the tube. 
1.This prevents leakage of fluids into the trachea
thus decreasing the chances of aspiration.
2.It also prevents leakage of gases around the tube
thus increasing the efficiency of ventilation.
3.Secures the tube in place.
Precautions 
1.The cuff is to be inflated with air only. No fluid
can be used since in case the cuff ruptures, the
fluid will cause aspiration.
2.An India Rubber tube can be kept in place up to
24 hours and a Portex tube up to 7 days. Beyond
this period, a tracheostomy should be done.
3. Deflate the cuff every 2-3 hours for I -2 minutes
to prevent tracheal necrosis.
4.Suctioning should be done every 15-30 min.

3 > Lar�ngosco�e ------ --
It consists of a handle and a blade with a light source. 
The handle has a rough surface for a better grip. It is 
usually short to prevent the handle from abutting the 
chest or breasts. The handle also contains the batteries 
which are required for the light source. 
The Blade can be of two types: straight blade (Miller) 
or curved blade (Macintosh). The straight blade is 
preferred in infants and children 
younger than 8 
years since the larynx is situated more anteriorly and Fig. 10.3: Laryngoscope 
cephalad than in adults. The blade has a slot at the base 
where is attached onto the handle. It can be fixed at 90 
degrees to the handle. It has a long shaft which used 
to compress the soft tissues of the oral cavity and the 
pharynx. It has a blunt and slightly bulbous tip which 
is used to elevate the larynx. 
The light source is usually a small light bulb which 
fits onto a socket on the blade and lights up when the 
blade is locked onto the handle and fixed at 90 degrees. 
Uses 
1.To pass an endotracheal tube
2.To visualize the upper airway upto the vocal
cords (Direct Laryngoscopy)
Procedure 
Patient is placed in supine position with the cervical 
spine flexed and the head extended at the atlanto oc­
cipital 
joint. Standing at the head end of the patient, 
the handle of the laryngoscope is held in the left hand 
and the mouth of the patient is opened with the right 
hand. The blade of the laryngoscope is passed into the 
oral cavity and the tip is placed between the base of 
the tongue and the epiglottis. The soft tissues of the 
oral cavity and pharynx are then elevated with upward 
movement of the handle of the laryngoscope in order 
to visualize the vocal cords. 
At this time, a second helper provides Cricoid Pressure 
(Sellicks maneuver). The thyroid cartilage is located 
and the hard tissue just below it is the cricoid carti­
lage. Using the thumb and index finger, firm pressure 
is applied over the cricoid cartilage. This blocks the 
457 

esophagus with the firm cartilage of the trachea. It
also allows the larynx and vocal cords to be visual­
ized more easily. 
With the vocal cords in view and the helper apply­
ing cricoid pressure, the endotracheal tube is passed 
between the vocal cords. The proper tube placement 
is confirmed by five point auscultation. Only after 
confirmation of proper tube placement and inflation 
of the balloon, is the cricoid pressure removed. 
Sterilization 
The blade and the handle (with the batteries removed) 
are sterilized by soaking in a solution of gluteraldehyde 
followed by properly rinsing them with warm water 
and drying the instruments with a clean soft cloth. 
Complications 
1. 
2.

rate and blood pressure. 
Oxygen Mask and 
Oxygen Cannula (Nasal 
Prong�s>�------
The oxygen mask consists of the mouth piece which 
snugly fits over the nose and the mouth through which 
oxygen can be administered. There are small openings 
on either side of the mask for expired air. 
The oxygen cannula or nasal prongs consist of two 
prongs which fit into the external nares (nostrils) of 
the patient. 
They are disposable and should not be reused. 
Indications 
They are both used to provide supplemental oxygen 
to a patient in respiratory distress, cardiac arrest or 
congestive cardiac failure. 
Oxygen Concentration Delivered 
Oxygen Cannula can provide upto 44% oxygen.

Oxygen Mask can provide upto 60% oxygen at 6 to 
10 L/min 
Oxygen Mask with Reservoir can provide 90 to 100% 
oxygen. There is a corrugated tube or reservoir bag 
attached to the mask in which oxygen is concentrated 
to deliver a higher percentage of oxygen to the patient. 
6 L/min -60% 
7 L/min -70% 
•8 L/min -80%

Precautions 
Patients who are unconscious or in coma may vomit and 
aspirate the vomitus in case a tight fitting mask is used. 
Refer to Chapter 11, Pg. 503 Oxygen Therapy. 
5 > Nebulizer Chamber 
This is a chamber which is connected to the nebulizer 
and oxygen mask on either side, so that when the 
patient breaths, along with oxygen, nebulized drug 
would also be inhaled. 
Uses: In bronchial asthma and other respiratory ill­
nesses, drugs like salbutamol beclomethasone and 
ipratropium bromide can be administered. 
6 > Metered Dose Inhaler 
This is a pressurized aerosol system. It consists of an 
L-shaped tube consisting of mouthpiece, which is
taken in the mouth, and a tube to hold the canister of
the medicines to be inhaled.
To administer the drug, the patient inhales after put­
ting the mouthpiece in the mouth. The patient holds 
the breath, presses the canister and inhales through 
the mouth, the fixed dose of drug liberated.

The advantage s over oral or parenteral drug admin­
istration are that there is a rapid onset of action, a 
smaller dose of drug is required, there is a lower 
incidence of side effects, the inhaler is easier to carry 
and it is cost-effective. 
The biggest disadvantage with this method is that cor­
rect coordination from the patient is required. 
The patient is ad viced to rinse his mouth after each use 
in order to prevent oral candidial infection s.

separate and can be seen through the transparent body. 
The patientthen puts the mouthpiece between his teeth, 
seals his lips around it and breathe s in through the 
mouth as deeply as possible. The rotahaler is easier to 
manipulate than the MDI and is specially suitable for 
children, elderly, arthritic patiens. The disadvantage s 
are that it requires a minimal inspiratory flow rate of 
about 28 litres/min and since it is difficult to assemble 
in breathle ss or handicapped patient s. 
9 Nelson's Inhaler 
This is an earthenware inhaler which is filled up to the 
base of the spout with three quarter cold water. The 
glass mouthpiece is boiled and inserted in the cork so 
that it points in a direction opposite to the spout. The 
patient inhales through the mouth only and exhales 
through the nose. The drug used is tincture benzoin, 
menthol, eucalyptus or pine. The inhaler is covered 
by a flannel bag which fits it. It is useful in respiratory 
ailment s and coryza.

Sizes of the Bag 
Pediatric Sizes (240 ml and 750 ml) and Adult Size 
Indications 
It is used to provide Intermittent Positive Pressure 
Ventilation 
Procedure 
When the bag is squeezed, air is driven into the lungs 
of the patient via the face mask, endotracheal tube or 
tracheostomy. The pressure release valve prevents 
high pressure ventilation thus preventing barotrau­
mas. On releasing of the pressure the bag re-inflates 
automatically. The recoil of the chest causes the air to 
leave the lungs by the one-way expiratory valve. The 
Ambu Bag has to be cleaned after each use by soaking 
it in a disinfectant solution and then properly rinsing 
and drying it. 
Flange Bite portion 
Fig. 10.9. Oropharyngeal Alf way --- - -- ----
The oropharyngeal airway is a plastic or metal instru­
ment. It has 3 part: the flange, the bite portion and 
the body. The flange is a circular flat part at the oral 
end which prevents the airway from entering the oral 
cavity. The bite portion is a straight firm part between 
the flange and body. It is at the level of the teeth and 
prevents the patient from biting the airway and causing 
obstruction to the air channel. The body is curved and 
rests over the tongue and with the tip facing the larynx. 
The nasopharyngeal airway is made of plastic or rub­
ber. It is longer and has a flange and a body. The body 
is curved to fit in the nasopharynx. 
The metal airways are sterilized by autoclaving or 
boiling. The plastic airways are disposable and meant 
for one time use. 

( 10 ) Instruments 
Indications 
Airway maintenance in the unconscious patient 
Protects an endotracheal tube from being bitten 
•Facilitates airway suctioning
Indications for Using a Nasopharyngeal 
Airway 
The oropharyngeal airway is preferred except in the 
following situations 
1.The 
mouth cannot be opened
2.There are loose teeth which might get detached
and be aspirated
3.If there is macroglossia like in Pierre Robin
Syndrome
4.In any pathology of the oral cavity
Procedure 
The size of the oropharygneal airway is assessed by 
measuring the distance from angle of mouth to the 
angle of the jaw. The 
patient's mouth is opened with 
the left hand or using the chin lift maneuver. The oral 
airway is inserted upside down, so its concavity is di­
rectly upward, until the soft palate is reached. At this 
point the airway is rotated 180 degrees, the concavity 
is directed inferiorly and the airway is slipped into 
place over the tongue. 
In children it is better to use a tongue depressor be­
fore inserting the airway in the correct position. The 
airway must not push the tongue backward and block 
the airway. It is then secured in place using adhesive 
tape attached to the bite portion. 
The size of the nasopharyngeal airway is assessed by 
measuring the distance form the tip of the nose to the 
tragus of the ear and adding 2.5 cm to it. It is lubricated 
well and inserted into any nostril gently until it rests 
in the pharynx. It is then fixed in place. 
Complications 
1.Oropharyngeal Airway
•If the airway too long it may obstruct the
larynx by pushing down the epiglottis
against the posterior pharynx
If the airway too short it may push the
tongue backwards and cause obstruction
•Vomiting may be stimulated in a conscious
or semiconscious patient.2. Laryngospasm 
-if the epiglottis or vocal 
cords are touched 
Local trauma to the lips, gums, teeth, tongue 
or soft palate. 
Nasopharyngea/ Airway 
A long airway may enter the esophagus 
and cause gastric hyperinflation and 
pulmonary hypoventilation (if bag and 
mask ventilation is being used) 
Vomiting may be stimulated in a conscious 
or semiconscious patient. 
Laryngospasm -if the epiglottis or vocal 
cords are touched 
Local trauma to the nasal cavity or soft

end to be fitted into the catheter and one broad end to 
be fitted with the rubber bulb. When the bulb is pressed, 
the air goes out and when released the fluid is sucked 
into it. It can be sterilized by autoclaving or boiling. 
Uses 
1.Bladder wash
2.Irrigation of wounds or cavities
Procedure 
The solution used for bladder wash (Potassium Per­
manganate, Silver Nitrate or Betadine) is sucked into 
the asepto syringe by placing its tapering end into the 
solution and squeezing and releasing the bulb. The 
tapering end of the asepto syringe is connected to the 
urinary catheter which is inserted into the bladder. 
The asepto syringe is held vertically and the bulb is 
squeezed to push the air and fluid into the bladder. The 
bulb is then released and fluid is sucked back into the 
syringe. This procedure is repeated till the returning 
fluid is the same colour as the instilled fluid.

17 > Foley's Self-retaining 
Catheter 
Balloon inflation tip 
Urinary drainage tip Catheter 
Fig. 10 15 Foley's self-retaining catheter 
It is a double lumen, self retaining, disposable, sterile 
and ready to use catheter. It is made of latex. It has a 
sub-terminal balloon and an eye on one end and the 
other end is bifid. The catheter has two lumens, one 
big one for the passage of urine and the other smaller 
one for inflation of the balloon with sterile normal 
saline. The inflated balloon makes the catheter 'self­
retaining' by resting at the bladder neck. The bifid end 
has two channels, one is for the passage of urine and is 
connected to the urosac bag and the other is smaller 
and connected to the balloon through the smaller 
lumen. The smaller channel has a valve which prevents 
the injected fluid from coming out. It is also available as a siliconized tube which is more 
inert and non irritant than the latex tube. There may 
also be a triple lumen catheter in which the third lu­
men is used for irrigation of the bladder. 
It is available in a gamma irradiated sterile pack cov­
ered with a plastic sheath. It is to be used only once. 
Sizes 
The most commonly used sizes are in the 'French 
system' indicated by the letter F. Sizes 8 F to 30 F are 
available in even numbers. IF= 0.3 mm. 
Common sizes used in males: 16, 18. 
Common sizes used in females: 14, 16. 
Other systems of caliberations are the English (E), 
American and German (Benique). 
Balloon Capacity 
The balloon can be filled from 5 to 50 cc. The maxi­
mum capacity is indicated on the smaller channel. 
Over-filling with saline can lead to rupture of the 
balloon, and a constant urge to defecate due to pres­
sure on the rectum. 
Uses 
Urinary 
1. Acute retention of urine: To relieve it and to
differentiate it from anuria
2. 
3. UMN or LMN bladders: To prevent incontinence
Transverse myelitis: To prevent over-distention

Non Urinary 
1.Epistaxis: For nasal packing
2.As a Sengstaken Blakemore tube in children to
control esophageal variceal bleeds
3.As an enema tube in children
Procedure 
The parts are shaved beforehand. Consent is 
not needed if done in an emergency. With sterile 
precautions (wearing two pairs of gloves), the 
parts are cleaned an antiseptic solution. The 
prepuce is retracted and the glans is also cleaned. 
The outer pair of gloves should be discarded. 10cc 
of Lignocaine jelly is injected into the urethra 
and retained for about 2 minutes. 
The assistant strips the outer unsterile plastic 
cover off the Foley's Catheter. The doctor takes 
out the Foley's Catheter holding the sterile inner 
plastic cover and exposes the tip by removing 
the plastic along the dotted line. 
Lignocaine jelly is applied on the tip of the 
catheter and it is inserted along the floor of the 
urethra until the bifurcation. The doctor only 
touches the sterile inner plastic sheath, not the 
catheter directly. This is called the 'No Touch 
Technique'. 
The balloon is inflated with 5 cc to 30 cc of sterile 
saline. The catheter is now GENTLY pulled 
until resistance is felt. This resistance implies 
the balloon is adequately filled and impinged 
on the base of the bladder making the catheter 
self-retaining. 
An urosac bag is applied to the catheter. 
The prepuce is replaced back over the glans. 
The catheter is taped to the inner side of the 
thigh. An antibiotic or Vaseline gauze dressing 
is given to the tip of the penis. 
Precautions 
1.The catheter should be inserted up to the
bifurcation irrespective of the outflow of urine.
The balloon is sub-terminal and the eye is distal
to it. Hence there is a chance of the eye being in
the bladder allowing the outflow of urine, while
the balloon is still in the urethra. At this point
if the balloon is inflated it will lead to rupture
of the urethra.
464 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
2.The balloon should be inflated with saline and
not air for the following reasons:
•Air in the balloon will cause it to float on
the urine in the bladder causing incomplete
drainage of urine.
In case ofrupture of the balloon, air could be
absorbed through the vesical veins leading
to an air embolism.
3.In females, the catheter can easily enter the
vagina and get coiled. In this situation, no urine
will come out from the catheter.
Care after Catheterisation 
1.Patient should be instructed not to pull the
catheter.
2.Daily dressings of the glans should be done by
retracting the prepuce and cleaning the glans
and the catheter with an antiseptic solution.
3.Bladder washes should be done frequently to
decrease chances of cystitis
Changing the Catheter 
The Latex Foleys catheter can be retained for a period 
of 1-2 weeks following which it should be changed. 
The siliconized catheter can be retained for 1 month. 
Complications 
1.Difficulty in deflating the balloon to remove the
catheter.
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. •Over-distend the balloon with saline or
distilled water
Inject 1 mlofEther. Beingvolatileit expands
and ruptures the balloon. It is fat soluble.
Cut the catheter above the level of the valve.
If obstruction is distal to the valve, it will
be relieved.

Disadvantages 
1.It is highly irritant and thus cannot be used for
long periods
2.It can be difficult to remove due to difficulty in
straightening the flower.
3.The flower might get detached. This needs
cystoscopic or ultrasonographic removal.19 > Condom Catheter 
: Fig 10.17: Condom Catheter ' -.
It can be prepared by making a small nick on a condom 
and passing a Malecot's catheter through it so that the 
flower rests on the nick. 
Readymade catheters are also available which have a 
stiff condom which goes over the penis and an opening 
at the terminal end which can be directly connected 
to the urosac bag. It does not need attachment to the 
Malecot's catheter. 
Uses 
Chronic incontinence of urine where passage of a 
urinary catheter per urethra can lead to urinary tract 
infections. 
Advantage 
The bladder is not catheterized and hence the chances 
ofurinary tract infections (cystitis and urethritis) are 
reduced.

1.Stomach washes in poisonings when the
suspected poison is thick and viscous, (e.g.
Opium, food poisoning) in which case the
thinner tubes may get clogged.
2.Aspiration of gastric contents to prepare a patient
for emergency surgery in case the stomach is full.
Procedure 
The tip of the tube is lubricated. The tube is introduced 
466 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
into the mouth and pharynx and the patient is 
encouraged to swallow. The tube is gently pushed 
forward into the stomach. The tubes' place is confirmed 
by aspiration of the gastric contents or injecting air 
while auscultating the epigastrium. To give a stomach 
wash, the funnel is connected to the proximal end. The 
funnel is raised above the level of the stomach and the 
fluid enters stomach. To remove the fluid, the funnel 
is lowered below the level of the stomach and the fluid 
comes out by the siphon action. 
22 > Ryle's Tube (RT) or 
Nasogastric Tube_ 
70Cms (3) 
Fig. 10.20 · Ryle's tube 
. --Base 
It is a 75 cm long thin tube made of polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC) which is open at one end and has an oval tip at 
the other end with 3 -4 sub-terminal openings. There 
are 2 or 3 lead balls which make the tip heavy, allowing 
easy passage of the tube into the stomach. There are 
3 markings on the tube denoting the position of the 
tube at 50, 60 and 70 cm from the tip. 
The cardia, the body and the pylorus are at 40, 50 and 
57 cm respectively from the incisor teeth. There is a blue 
or green line along the entire length which is radio 
opaque. This allows it to be seen on X-Ray. It is avail­
able in a gamma irradiated pack and is for single use. 
The nasogastric tube was originally made of India 
Rubber. There is a modification called the Levine 
Tube which is longer, made of Portex and has no lead 
balls. The Levine Tube is suitable for insertion up to 
the duodenum. 
Sizes 
Available in sizes 8 to 22 French in even numbers, 8 

( 10 ) Instruments 
being the smallest and 22 being the largest diameter. 
Regular Adult sizes are 14 -16 F. 
Uses 
Diagnostic 
Upper gastro-intestinal bleeding: In cases of 
hematemesis or malena, the RT is inserted and 
gastric fluid is aspirated to diagnose upper GI 
bleeding. 
Gastric Analysis: To diagnose peptic ulcer disease, 
Zollinger Ellison syndrome, achlorhydria, etc. 
Poisoning: Aspirate sent for analysis 
Exfoliative cytology: For diagnosis of stomach 
cancer 
Tuberculosis in children: Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB) 
in the aspirate in children who cannot produce 
sputum or swallow it. Early morning aspiration 
is preferred. 
•Tracheo-esophageal fistula: In newborns, there
will be an obstruction to the passage of the RT
or the RT will coil up in the blind esophagus.
Therapeutic 
•Enteral feeding of nutrients or drugs for patients
who cannot ingest it orally
Gastric lavage or stomach washes in case of
poisoning and hematemesis.
•Gastric decompression in intestinal obstruction,
paralytic ileus, acute gastric dilation, peritonitis
or post operatively.
In acute cholecystitis or acute pancreatitis: to
give rest to the bowel
Contra Indications 
•Corrosive poisoning
•Kerosene poisoning
Procedure 
With the patient sitting up, the more patent or larger 
nostril is selected. It is properly cleaned and then 
anesthetized by instilling lignocaine jelly. The RT is 
removed from the pack and the tip is lubricated with 
lignocaine jelly on it. 
The tip is now gently pushed along the floor of the nose 
and the patient is encouraged to swallow as the tube 
passes into the throat and into the esophagus. This closes the epiglottis and allows the RT to pass into the 
esophagus. The RT gently pushed further until the 2nd 
mark is at the nostril. 
Confirm the RT is in place by the following methods 
and then secure it with adhesive tape: 
Aspirating Gastric contents from the RT 
Injecting air through the RT while simultaneously 
auscultating the epigastrium 
Putting the nasal end of the RT into a bowl of 
water. If the RT is in the trachea, there will be 
air bubbles. 
Tracheal intubations will result in coughing as 
the RT irritates the trachea or bronchi. 
Plain X Ray of the Abdomen will show the radio 
opaque line along the RT and the lead shots. 
Precautions 
RT Feeding: The patient has to be propped up. There 
should be 2 hours between feeds. Before feeding, as­
pirate the gastric content to check if at least one third 
the contents have been emptied or not. If not, the feed 
should be delayed. The RT should be flushed after the 
feeding. The patient should be propped up for at least 
half an hour after the feed. 
Complications 
1.Epistaxis, rhinitis
2.Pharyngitis
3. Esophagi tis, esophageal perforation, rupture and
bleeding of esophageal varices
4.Reflux esophagitis since lower esophageal
sphincter is incompetent
5.Gastritis,gastric bleeding (ifover-zealous suction
done rapidly)
6.Aspiration pneumonia if tracheal insertion not
detected
7.Hypokalemic, hypochloremic, metabolic
acidosis if overzealous suction

and 3 channels. There is a distal gastric balloon and a 
proximal esophageal balloon. The central channel is 
for gastric aspiration or lavage. The other two channels 
are for inflating the gastric balloon ( capacity 120 ml) 
and esophageal balloon (capacity 30 ml). 
Modifications 
Minnesota modification has an additional 
channel for esophageal aspiration. It has holes 
on the tube just proximal to the esophageal 
balloon for esophageal aspiration. 
Linton Nahas Tube has only a gastric balloon but 
no esophageal balloon. It has only 2 channels. 
Uses 
To obtain hemostasis by pressure in cases of bleeding 
esophageal or gastric varices. Hemostasis is achieved 
by pressure. 
Procedure 
The tube can be passed through the mouth or prefer­
ably the nose. The larger nostril is anesthetized using 
lignocaine jelly. The tip of the tube is also coated with 
lignocaine jelly and the tube is passed along the floor 
of the nose through the pharynx into the stomach. 
Once in the stomach, the gastric balloon is filled 
with air. The tube is now withdrawn until the gastric 
balloon tightly occludes the cardia. The esophageal 
balloon is then inflated with air. The catheter is put 
under traction using external weights. Aspiration of 
the gastric contents indicates whether the bleeding 
has stopped or not. 
Precautions 
1. 
468 It should not be kept in place for more than 48 
to 72 hours. 2. 
3. 
4. PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
The gastric and esophageal balloons should be 
deflated alternately after 24 hours to prevent 
pressure necrosis. 
The saliva which cannot be swallowed due to 
the esophageal balloon should be continuously 
suctioned out. 
If the bleeding does not stop or if the patient 
re-bleeds, emergency surgical or endoscopic 
intervention should be undertaken 
Complications 
1. 
2. 
3. Pressure necrosis of the esophagus or stomach 
mucosa if retained more than 48 to 72 hours. 
Aspiration pneumonia due to saliva collection

25 > Record Syringe and 
Needle 
10 5 I-
It consists of a piston made of metal and a glass body 
with a long tapering nozzle that is also made of metal. 
It derives its name from the fact that for the first time in 
the history of medicine, something could be recorded. 
It is available in sizes 2, 5, 10 and 20 cc. 
Advantage 
The piston does not come out of the body and break. 
Disadvantage 
It cannot be autoclaved as it is partly glass and partly 
metallic. The cement between the glass and the metal 
melts on autoclaving and as glass and metal expand 
differently, the syringe can be damaged. Hence, they 
are rarely used today.

manufactured it. The B.D. Syringe is made of glass. 
It has a piston and a barrel with a nozzle. The barrel 
is calibrated according to the capacity of the syringe. 
The barrel has a flattened flange at one end to give a 
grip while injecting. The nozzle may be eccentrically 
or centrally placed. The piston is floating since it is hol­
low. It is available in 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 cc. sizes. 
Glass syringes are sterilized by boiling or autoclaving. 
Plastic syringes are also available for one time use. 
They are disposable, sterile and ready to use and are 
available in gamma irradiated packs. They are not to 
be sterilized and reused. 
The B.D. needle has a bevel, body and shoulder. The 
number of the needle varies inversely with the thick­
ness. The lower the number, the thicker is the needle, 
e.g. number 18 needle has a thickness of 1/lS'h of an
inch.
The needle can be fitted directly to the nozzle or can 
be locked together by applying a metallic Leur Lock 
to the needle which prevents slipping of the needle. If 
the syringe has a Leur Lock, it cannot be autoclaved 
or boiled since it is metal.

38 > Venesection Needle 
This is a needle with a cannula. Just above the tip it 
is bulbous, to which a polyethylene tube snugly fits. 
(The other end of the polyethylene tube is pushed in 
the vein after venesection). As the name suggests it is 
used during venesection. 
39 > Scalp Vein Needle 
: Fig 10.36.ScalpVeinneedle 
It consists of a short beveled siliconized stainless steel 
needle connected to a polyethylene tube which has a 
stopper at the end. Between the needle and the tube are 
plastic butterfly shaped wings which is used to give a 
better grip while inserting and to fix the needle to the 
skin. The tube can be closed with the stopper. They 
are disposable, sterile and ready to use. Sizes available 
are 18 to 25 G (gauge). The smaller the number, the 
larger the bore of the needle. 
Uses 
l.To get venous access for a short period (24 -48
hours) for administration of intravenous fluid,
drugs
2.For Blood Collection, specially in children
Procedure 
Choose an appropriate vein. Clean the site with spirit. 
Give proximal pressure with a tourniquet to distend 
the veins. Holding the scalp vein needle with the but­
terflywings folded, the needle is inserted with the bevel 
facing upwards. As soon as blood starts coming into the tube, the tube is kinked. The scalp vein needle is 
fixed with adhesive tape to the skin. The tube is then 
flushed with saline or 0.5ml of heparin. When used in 
children, the hand has to be splinted to prevent move­
ment since movement can cause counter-puncture. 
Complications 
•Counter-puncture detected by hematoma
(swelling) formation just distal to the scalp vein
needle or by resistance felt during flushing with
saline or heparin
Thrombophlebitis due to infection or irritation
by drugs or fluids
40 > Pleural or Ascitic 
Aspiration Needle -----
These are long BD needles. The 18 number needle is 
used for pleural or ascitic fluid aspiration when the 
fluid is thin. Whereas 13-14 needle is used when the 
fluid is likely to be thick. 
41 > Intravenous Cannulas 
(Venflow or Angiocath} 
Fig. 10 3 7: Ang1ocatheter 
It consists of a beveled siliconized stainless steel needle 
and an outer cannula ( sheath) made of PTFE (Poly Tetra 
Fluoro Ethylene). The needle snugly fits into the outer 
sheath. They are available in two forms. 
•with wings and an injection port (VENFLOW)
without wings and without injection port
(ANGIOCATH)
The wings make it easier to fix the needle to the skin. 
The IV cannula without wings can be rotated and ma­
neuvered. They are disposable, sterile and ready to use. 
473 

Sizes 
14 -24 G in even increments. Smaller the number, 
larger the bore of the needle. 
Uses 
To get venous access for a longer period ( 48 -72 hours) 
for the administration ofintravenous fluid, intravenous 
drugs, blood and blood products, multiple fluids or 
drugs together 
Procedure 
After choosing an appropriate vein, the site is cleaned 
with spirit. Proximal pressure is given with a tourni­
quet to distend the veins. Holding the venflow with 
the index finger and the middle finger at the wings 
and the thumb at the proximal most end, the venflow 
is inserted into the vein. Once blood starts coming 
into the sheath, the venflow is held steady in place. 
The needle is withdrawn slightly (but not all the way 
out; it should still be in the sheath). The venflow is 
then pushed in all the way, so the needle supports 
the sheath but does not counter-puncture the vein. 
Occluding the vein distal to the inserted venflow, the 
needle is withdrawn from the sheath. A three way is 
now attached to the sheath and it is flushed with saline 
to rule out counter-puncture. The venflow with the 
three way is attached to the skin with adhesive tape. 
Complications 
Counter-puncture: Detected by hematoma 
(swelling) formation just distal to the scalp vein 
needle or by resistance felt during flushing with 
saline or heparin 
Thrombophlebitis due to infection or irritation 
by drugs or fluids 
42 > Three Way ---------
It is a T-shaped instrument. It consists of two inlets 
and one outlet. By a screw, either or both of the inlets 
can be connected to the outlet. It is disposable, sterile 
and ready to use. 
Uses 
It is commonly connected to an I.V. Cannula 
474 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
Fig. 10.38: Three way 
�--�--- - --- -- ------
where thorough one inlet I. V. fluids pass and 
through the other inlet medications can be given 
or the CVP can be monitored. 
It is also useful to connect the three way whilst 
aspirating fluid from body cavities e.g. pleural 
tap. Through one inlet fluid is withdrawn from 
the body cavity into a syringe and by changing 
the direction of the screw, the fluid from the 
syringe can be pushed into a kidney tray. 
•Exchange transfusion: Two three ways have to
be used simultaneously
Precaution 
The three way should always be screwed shut when 
not being used. If the screw is wrongly placed leaving 
it open or it is accidentally shifted, bleeding can occur 
from the vein. 
43 > I. V. Set 
The I. V. Set has three parts: the proximal limb, Murphy's 
chamber and the distal limb. The proximal limb has a 
Fig. 10.39 IV Set with Murphy's chamber 
-- ---- ----------. 

( 10 ) Instruments 
sharp pointed tip which is used to puncture the outlet 
of the I. V. Fluid bottle or bag. 
The Murphy's chamber is a glass chamber that is used 
to regulate the flow of fluid by adjusting the number 
of drops falling per minute. 
The distal limb is consists of a long tubing with a nozzle 
at the end which is attached to the venous access ( scalp 
vein, angiocath or three-way). It also has a regulator 
which is used to adjust the rate of flow through the 
Murphy's chamber. There may be a rubber tip just at 
proximal to the nozzle so that any drug can be injected 
bolus through it if necessary. They are disposable, sterile 
(gamma irradiation) and ready to use. 
Types 
The main difference is in the Murphy's chamber. 
1.Macrodrip Set
The Murphy's chamber is normal. 16 drops
constitute 1ml.
Uses
1.Fluid administration such as colloids
(albumin, hemaxcele, Dextran) or
crystalloids (normal saline, ringer lactate,
DNS)
2, I.V. drug administration (antibiotics, iron, 
etc.) 
2.Microdrip Set
The Murphy's chamber has a thin needle coming
into it from the top. 16 micro drops constitute
1ml.
Uses : Accurate small quantities of drugs
have to be given I.V. (nitroglycerine, sodium
nitroprusside, dopamine, dobutamine, adrenal­
ine, noradrenaline, insulin, heparin, etc.)
3.Blood Transfusion Set
The Murphy's chamber has a filter in it to filter
out any clots.
Uses
Transfusion ofblood and blood products ( whole
blood, packed cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma,
cryoprecipitate, coagulation factors, etc.)Precautions With Murphy's Chamber 
Before connecting the I.V. Set to the venous access, the 
regulator should be fully opened and the fluid should 
be allowed to fill the Murphy's chamber up to a certain 
level and fill the tubing. This drives all the air in the 
tubing out and prevents air embolism. The fluid level 
in the Murphy's Chamber will prevent the air from the 
proximal part to enter the venous access. Thus a fluid 
level should always be maintained. 
44 > Clinical Thermometer 
98.4°F or 37°C 
Clinical thermometer is used to record temperature. 
In a clinical thermometer there is a constriction just 
beyond the bulb. When the thermometer bulb is placed 
in the mouth, mercury within expands and this force 
of expansion is great enough to force the expanding 
mercury past this constriction. The part of the mercury 
which has expanded beyond the constriction remains 
in position and indicates patient's temperature. The 
mercury must be jerked back into the bulb before the 
thermometer is used again. 
Clinical thermometer is calibrated over the range 
95-108°F, since the body temperature does not vary
much from its normal values of98.4°F. Since the bulb
is thin and small, the thermometer is quick acting,
reaching the body temperature in about 1 min. The
quantity of mercury used is small and the capillary
tube must therefore have a very fine bore. To enable
the thermometer to be read, the front of the glass is
shaped so as to produce a magnified image of the thread.
After being washed and wiped it should be stored in
a glass jar partly filled with a disinfectant like 70%
isopropyl alcohol with 1 % iodine. The jar should have
a piece of cotton wool at the bottom.
Recording the temperature: 
After cleaning the thermometer and shaking it to bring 
the column of mercury down to about 2° below nor-
475 

mal, the temperature is recorded in the axilla, groin, 
mouth or rectum. 
1.In the axilla or groin: When either of these parts
is used it must not be exposed for washing
for at least half an hour before recording the
temperature. Perspiration, if any, is wiped away
and the bulb of the thermometer is carefully
placed in position and the arm brought across
the chest and kept there, the patient supporting
his elbow with his other hand. If the groin is
used the legs should be crossed at the knees.
The thermometer is less likely to be broken by a
sudden movement of the patient, and a correct
temperature is obtained if it is placed high in
the axilla and the stem laid against the chest,
parallel to the arm and between the two. The
thermometer is left in position for 3-5 minutes.
2.In the mouth: The bulb of the thermometer is
placed under the tongue. The patient must close
his lips but not teeth. If the lips are not kept
closed, cold air will enter and wrong temperature
may be recorded. Hence this method is used
only if the patient can breathe comfortably
through the nose. No drink should be given for
10 minutes before the thermometer is used. It
should never be used in unconscious patients
or young children as they may bite it
3.In the rectum: This is the most reliable method. To
reduce the risk ofinjury, the thermometer should
have a rounded or pear-shaped bulb. The rectum
must be empty of feces and the instrument must
be oiled and introduced for 4 ems and left in
position for 1-2 minutes. Thermometers used
in taking rectal temperature should be reserved
for that purpose.
Rectal temperature is 1 °F higher than mouth
temperature which is 1 °F higher than axillary
or groin temperature.
45 > Flatus Tube 
It is a stout tube made oflndia Rubber. It is 45 cm (18 
inches) long and is open at both ends. In addition it 
has one or two eyes (sub-terminal openings) at one 
end to facilitate expulsion of gas. It can be sterilized 
by autoclaving or boiling. 
476 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
� .... ; ... �
Uses 
It is used to help passage of flatus e.g. in typhoid 
tympanitis. 
Procedure 
With the patient in left lateral position with lower leg 
extended & upper leg flexed a lubricated flatus tube is 
inserted (with the end having sub terminal openings) 
into the anus up to 10 to 20 cm. The end (without the 
eye) which is outside should be placed in a bowl of 
water or potassium permanganate (preferable since it 
acts as a good deodorant) and the number of bubbles 
produced should be counted. Usually 8 bubbles per 
minute or more than 60 bubbles totally are good results. 
Contra-indications 
Painful perianal conditions 
Fig. 10 42: Proctoscope 
Parts 
1. 
2. 
3. The Body or Flange: It is funnel shaped with a 
handle at an obtuse angle to it. 
The Obturator: It has a bulbous tip which when 
inserted into the flange protrudes outside the 
flange. This creates a smooth rounded surface 
of the assembled proctoscope, thus preventing 
the mucosa of the rectum and anal canal from 
being caught in the distal end. 
Torch or Source of light 

< 10 ) Instruments 
Uses 
For proctoscopic examination to diagnose condition 
like hemorrhoids, anal fistulas, anorectal strictures 
or ulcers and for internal banding of hemorrhoids. 
Procedure 
The patient is placed in the left lateral position. The 
upper leg is flexed and the lower leg is extended. Per 
rectal examination is done to exclude painful pathology 
of the anus and anal canal. The assembled proctoscope 
is lubricated and inserted in the anus in the direction 
of the umbilicus, asking the patient to take deep in­
spirations. The obturator is withdrawn and through 
the flange light is thrown into the rectum to visualize 
any pathology. Gradually, the flange is withdrawn and 
the rectum and anal canal are visualized. 
Precaution 
The flange must not be pushed in without the obturator 
as the sharp end of the flange might cause trauma to 
the anorectal mucosa. 
47 > Stethosco�e ------- -
Fig. 10.43: Stethoscope 
The stethoscope was invented by Laenec. This was a 
wooden instrument. Electronic and magnetic stetho­
scopes are also available. 
It has a dual chest piece with a valve that allows switch­
ing from the bigger diaphragm to the smaller bell. 
There is tube connecting the chest piece to the binaural 
connector and earpieces. The tubing length should be 12 inches. Double lumen tubes are ideal. The bell is 
usually 1 inch in diameter and the diaphragm is 11/2 
inches in diameter. 
Uses 
The stethoscope is used in auscultation of the chest or 
abdomen. The bell is used for low frequency sound 30 
to 150 Hz= S3, S4, MDM and the diaphragm is used 
for high frequency sound> 300 HZ= Sl, S2, clicks, 
OS, systolic murmur, early diastolic murmurs. 
48 > Central Venous 
Catheter -----
They are available in sterile disposable packs with the 
equipment required to insert them into a vein. 
Seldinger's Technique 
The Central Venous Catheter is a long thin tube 
which is inserted into the vein. It has marking along 
its length at an interval of 5 cm. It also has a radio­
opaque line which can be seen on X-rays. It usually 
contains the central line, the guide wire, introducer, 
needle and dilator. 
1.The guide wire is a slender wire which is used
to cannulate the vein first. Its tip is curved into
a T shape so as to make it non traumatic and
also so that the tip is not caught in any valves
in the veins. It is threaded into the introducer,
which is spiral, making the long guide wire
easier to handle.
2.The needle is usually 18 or 20 No. and is hollow
so that the guide wire can go through it.
3.The dilator is usually a plastic 
device with a
tapering tip which can be cannulated over the
guide wire in order to dilate the site of puncture
allowing the central line to be passed without
resistance into the vein.
Catheter Through Sheath Technique 
They usually contain a needle, sheath and the central 
venous catheter. 
1.The Needle is a large bore needle, No. 16. The
needle can be inserted into the sheath.
2.The Sheath is made of polyethylene and is shorter
than the needle so that the tip of the needle
477 

protrudes out of it when the needle is inserted 
into the sheath. 
3.The Central Venous line is similar to the one
above but it also has an inner wire to prevent it
from kinking while being inserted into the vein.
Indications 
1.Measurement of central venous pressure (CVP)
2.Venous access when no peripheral veins are
available or venous access is required for a
prolonged time
3.Administration of vasoactive/inotropic drugs
which cannot be given peripherally
4.Total parenteral nutrition
5.Hemodialysis/plasmapheresis
Method of Insertion 
After having selected the site, skin is cleaned painted 
and draped. Local anesthesia is infiltrated. 
Seldinger's Technique: 
The Heparinised Needle with a syringe attached is 
inserted into the vein and blood is aspirated. The 
Guide Wire is threaded through the needle into the 
vein with the J shaped end first. The Needle is then 
removed. The Dilator is passed over the guide wire 
in a twisting motion to dilate the site of skin punc­
ture. A small incision in the skin may be necessary 
to introduce the dilator. The dilator is removed and 
the Catheter is passed over the guide wire. The guide 
wire is then removed. After confirming blood can be 
aspirated freely, the catheter is flushed properly with 
heparinized saline. The catheter is secured in place with 
a suture and a sterile dressing is given. 
Catheter Through Sheath Technique: 
The Needle inside the Sheath is inserted into the vein 
and blood is aspirated. The Needle is withdrawn hold­
ing the Sheath steadily inside the vein. The Catheter is 
threaded into the vein through the sheath. The inner 
wire is removed from the central catheter followed by 
the sheath. After confirming blood can be aspirated 
freely, the catheter is flushed properly with heparinized 
478 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
saline. The catheter is secured in place with a suture 
and a sterile dressing is given. 
Method of Insertion of the Needle 
According to the Site Selected: 
1.Internal Jugular Vein: With the patient in head
low position and with the head turned to face
the left. The right Internal Carotid artery is
palpated in the lateral to the cricoid cartilage.
This falls within a triangle formed by the two
heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and
the clavicle below. Starting at the apex of the
triangle, keeping a finger gently over the artery,
the needle is inserted just lateral to the pulsations
at an angle of 30-40° to the skin and advance it
downward in the direction of the nipple on the
same side.
2.Subclavian Vein: The needle should be inserted
into the skin 1cm below the junction of inner
& middle 1 / 3 of the circle. The needle is kept
horizontal and is directed to sternal notch. 
3.Antecubital Vein: A tourniquet is applied to
the upper arm to distend the veins. The one
which is best visible is selected and the needle
is introduced.
4.Femoral Vein: The femoral artery pulsations
are felt 1 - 2 cm below the inguinal ligament.
Keeping a finger gently over the femoral artery,
the needle is inserted just medial to the pulsations
at an angle of 30 degrees.
Complications 
1.Hematoma formation or bleeding
2.Pneumothorax (specially with Subclavian
Venous access)

Injury to surrounding structures

1 > Transvenous Pacing __ 
Transvenous pacing can be done through the an­
tecubital, subclavian or external jugular veins. The 
antecubital vein technique is much easier especially 
in the sick patient, but there is a risk of electrode 
displacement, which could be reduced by strapping 
the arm to the side. 
Procedure 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. The right or the left antecubital fossa is selected 
and venesection is performed on the median 
cubital vein. 
A catheter is introduced through the cutdown. 
The position of the catheter is monitored under 
fluoroscopy, as it approaches the heart. 
The catheter is advanced into the right atrium and 
a loop is formed. The catheter is then manipulated 
through the tricuspid valve and the electrode is 
placed at the apex of the right ventricle. 
The catheter is connected to the external pace­
making unit, which is set to demand mode. 
The rate and the current are adjusted to the 
lowest setting and then the pacemaker is turned 
on. The rate is then gradually increased unit it 
exceeds the patient's intrinsic heart rate and the 
current is also gradually increased until capture is 
demonstrated. The threshold for pacing is judged 
by turning down the output voltage by 0.1 volt 
decrements until a minimum voltage to obtain 
consistent pacing is found. Usually the patient 
is placed at a voltage 2-2 1/2 times that of the 
pacing threshold. 
After pacing and sensing are demonstrated, 
the patient should be asked to cough and move 
about, after which pacing and sensing are checked 7. again. If the pacemaker function is unstable, the 
electrode position is changed and the procedure 
repeated. 
Once pacing is stable, the electrode is secured to 
the arm or chest and sterile dressing is applied to 
the wound. The heart rate should be maintained 
between 70-80/min. 
Complications 
1.Ventricular premature beats, tachycardia or
fibrillation may occur during insertion of the
catheter as it enters the right ventricle. Hence a
working D-C defibrillator must be at hand and
the above procedure performed in an intensive
cardiac care unit.
2.Perforation of the ventricle causing pericarditis
or cardiac tamponade.
2 > Cardioversion 
Cardioversion can be done with the help of a D-C de­
fibrillator, which should be checked regularly and kept 
in working condition. It should be set on synchronized 
mode so that the shock is delivered on the R or S wave 
and not on the T wave. Usually the energy setting is 
of 100 joules at the beginning and then it is gradually 
increased up to 400 joules. NB: If the patient is on 
digoxin it is much safer to start with a much smaller 
dose of 10-20 joules. 
Pre-requisites 
In an elective case, the following pre-requisites are 
necessary: 
1.Digoxin should be stopped for at least 48 hrs.
2.Anticoagulants like heparin and warfarin should
be started and continued for at least 6-12 weeks

3. 
4. 
5. F,g 11 1 Card1overs1011 
to prevent systemic embolization following 
successful cardioversion. 
If the patient has slow ventricular rate or atrial 
fibrillation of prolonged duration, atropine 
sulfate 1-2 mg should be given intravenousl y. 
The patient should be fasting overnight. 
Diazepam 5-10 mg should be given intravenously. 
Halothane as an anesthetic agent should 
avoided as it may precipitate arrhythmias. In an 
emergency, if cardioversion has to be done in a 
patient on digoxin, the following drugs should 
be given immediately before the shock: 
a)Beta blockers like propranolol 1 mg
intravenousl y. 
b) Diphenylhydantoin 100 to 250 mg
intravenously.
Procedure 
I.The procedure must be explained to the patient
because the idea of receiving an electric shock
creates a great deal of anxiety.
2.In male patients with a hairy chest, the chest
should be shaved to improve the contact with
the skin.
3.The patient is strapped and an ECG is connected.
4.The electrical jelly is applied well on the chest
wall anteriorly over apex and pulmonary area
5.The paddles are placed over the site where the
jelly is applied and taking care that no part of
the operator touches the patient or his bed, the
switch is pressed and current given.
6.If the arrhythmia is not corrected, the same
procedure is repeated after 5 minutes with a
higher current.
480 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
Complications 
I.Serious arrhythmias may occur if the patient
has been receiving digoxin.
2.Hypertension and pulmonary edema may
sometimes occur.
3.Burning of the skin of the chest wall may occur
if adequate jelly is not applied.
3 > Lumbar Puncture 
Lumber puncture is aspiration of cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF) from the spinal sub-arachnoid space by punc­
turing the spaces between lumbar 2 and 3 or lumbar 
3 and 4 vertebrae. 
Indications 
I.Diagnostic
A.Absolute:
1.Meningitis
2.Subarachnoid hemorrhage
B.Relative:
I.Neurosyphilis
2.Unexplained coma
3.Guillain Barre syndrome
4.Multiple sclerosis
C.Radiological:
I.Myelography
2.Pneumoencephalography (P.E.G.)
II.Therapeutic
A.To introduce drugs:
1.Methotrexate 0.25 mg/kg biweekly in
leukemia
2.Gentamicin 10-20 mg in gram
negative meningitis
3.Crystalline Penicillin 10,000-20,000
units in pyogenic meningitis
B.To reduce raised intro-cranial tension in
hypertensive encephalopathy
C.To administer spinal anesthesia
Contra-indications 
1.Raised intracranial tension (as shown by

< 11 ) Procedures 
papilledema) because of the risk of herniation of 
brain through foramen magnum, and damaging 
the vital medullary centres causing death. 
2.Marked spinal deformity
3.Local infections
4.Suspected cord compression
Procedure 
1.Position: The patient is placed on his side at the
edge of the bed with the knee drawn up and the
head flexed. It can also be done with the patient
sitting and bending forward.
2.Site: In the 3rd lumbar space. This space lies in
the plane which joins the highest points on the
iliac crest. The skin over the back from the lower
thoracic vertebrae to the coccyx is sterilized with
Cetavlon, ether, iodine and spirit. The part is
draped.
3.Local anesthesia: The skin to be punctured is
infiltrated with 5 ml of2% lignocaine. Infiltration
is done up to ligamentum flava.

6. Puncture: A lumbar puncture needle with a 
stilette is introduced after 2-3 minutes into the 
anesthetized space, with the cutting edge of the 
bevel in the direction parallel to the fibers of 
the ligamentum flava. The needle is introduced 
(slightly upwards and forwards at 5° to avoid 
injury to the disc) through the resistance 
of supraspinous ligament. The interspinous 
ligament is then easily negotiated. At about 4-7 
cm, the firmer resistance ofligamentum flavum 
popping sensation as the dura is breached. The 
stilette is then withdrawn and the fluid is collected 
slowly in 4-5 bulbs for biochemical, cytological 
and serological tests. 
Seal: The needle is withdrawn and the puncture 
mark is sealed with a tincture benzoin seal 
Post-procedure orders: 
a.Plenty of fluids are to be taken by mouth.
b.Head low position, with half to one block
to prevent headache
c.Salicylates, if headache
Problems 
I.Dry Tap
A.The needle is blocked: Re-insert the stilette
to dislodge any flap of dura that may have
blocked the needle.
B.Faulty technique: Repeat the procedure.
C.Subarachnoid block
II.Bloodstained CSF
A.Trauma to the spinal blood vessels.
B.Subarachnoid hemorrhage.
To distinguish between these two conditions. CSF 
must be collected in 2 parts is separate test tubes. The 
appearance of more blood in one sample compared 
to the other suggests trauma; in subarachnoid hemor­
rhage it is uniform. 
Complications 
1.Headache is the commonest problem. To mini­
mise this, plenty of fluids should be taken orally,
head-low position is to be given and salicylates
if required. In neurosyphilis, headache never
occurs following lumbar puncture.

Queckendstedt's 'Test' 
A manometer is attached to the lumbar puncture 
needle. Pressure is applied over one jugular vein and 
then the other. This raises the intra-cranial venous 
pressure, which also raises intraspinal venous pressure, 
and this is reflected in the manometer if the pathway 
between the skull and L.P needle is patent. The fluid 
will rise quickly by about 100 mm and falls less quickly 
on release of pressure. A delay signifies a spinal block. 
If pressure is applied on one jugular vein, and the 
pressure on the manometer vises, it indicates lateral 
sinus thrombosis. This is a positive Toby-Ayer's test.

Substances which are more in C.S.F than blood 
diminish in meningitis and substances which are less 
in C.S.F than blood increase in meningitis (except 
sugar which is low in meningitis because it is used by 
the organisms and is also required for the increased 
metabolism of the brain). 
The following substances are less in C.S.F than blood: 
Protein, Sugar, Cholesterol, Urea, Calcium and Phos­
phorus. 
The following substances are more in C.S.F than blood: 
Chlorides and Magnesium. 
The following substances are never seen in C.S.F as 
they do not cross the blood-brain barrier: antibodies, 
enzymes, penicillin, streptomycin, etc.

4 > Cisternal Puncture 
Cisternal puncture is aspiration of C.S.F from the 
cisterna magna by puncturing in midline, half an inch 
above the second cervical vertebra. 
Indications 
1.Diagnostic: Same as for lumbar puncture.
Lumbar puncture is preferred to cisternal
puncture. If L.P has been traumatic or if there
is spinal deformity and LP is difficult, cisternal
puncture is done.
2.Spinal block: When there is spinal block
demonstrated by a myelogram from below,
myodil is introduced also from above after a
cisternal puncture to know the upper limit of 
the block.
Contra-indications: Same as for L.P. 
Procedure 
1.Position: The patient is placed on his side at the
edge of the bed with his head flexed.
2.Site: In the mid-line halfan inch above the second
cervical vertebra and in the plane of the tip of
the mastoid. Hair is shaved over the back of the
head below external occipital protuberance and
the part is sterilized with Cetavlon, ether, iodine
and spirit.
3.Local anesthesia: The skin and the subcutaneous
tissues are punctured with 1 % lignocaine
4.Puncture: The cisternal puncture needle with
calibrations and short bevel is introduced in the
midline, half an inch above the second cervical
vertebra. It is pushed for about 4-5 ems in the
plane of tragus and nasion when it enters cisterna
magna and CSP comes out.
5 > Liver Bio�s1-_____ _
Liver biopsy is removal of a bit of the liver tissue per­
cutaneously for histological examination. 

( 11 ) Procedures 
Indications 
1.Cirrhosis of liver: To distinguish fatty liver from
cirrhosis and to diagnose the type of cirrhosis.
2.Hepatic malignancies: To diagnose hepatoma in
cirrhotic patients, as they are prone to develop
hepatoma.
3.Granulomas: eg. Tuberculosis, sarcoidosis,
schistosomiasis.
4.Metabolic and storage disease: e.g. Wilson's
disease, amyloidosis, Hodgkins.
5.Reticulo-endothelial diseases: e.g. leukemias,
multiple myeloma, Hodgkin's disease.
6.Unexplained feverwith hepatomegaly as occurs in
amebiasis, cholangitis, tuberculosis, brucellosis,
etc.
7.Unexplained jaundice: If jaundice persists after
2-3 weeks, and diagnosis is not obvious on clinical
and biochemical tests.
8.Jaundice due to chronic hepatitis: To differentiate
post-necrotic cirrhosis from other sequelae.
9.Screening relatives of patients with familial
diseases of liver.
Contra-indications 
1.Bleeding diathesis.
2.Protracted severe hepatocellular jaundice
because hepatic precoma may be precipitated.
3.Infections in liver, peritoneum, biliary tract,
right lung base and right subphrenic abscess.
4.Hydatid cyst in liver is suspected.
5.Hemangioma of liver is suspected.
6.Chronic passive congestion of the liver.
7.Gross ascites.
Pre-requisites 
1.The following investigations must be done:
Bleeding time, clotting time and prothrombin
time. If they are high, the patient must be given
injection Vit K 10 mg I.M. for 3 days. If the
prothrombin time does not return to normal
fresh frozen plasma must be given to the patient.
2.Blood should be sent for grouping and cross­
matching.3.If ascites is present, it must be tapped first and
then the biopsy done.
Procedure 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. Pre-anesthetic medication: Injection atropine 0.6 
mg and injection phenobarbitone 50 mg must 
be given intramuscularly half an hour before the 
procedure. 
Position: Patient lies on his back in the bed with 
the right side very near the edge of the bed. 
Site: Ninth or tenth inter-costal space in the 
midaxillary line. The area is sterilized with 
Cetavlon, ether, iodine and spirit. 
Local anesthetic: The skin, subcutaneous tissue 
and the tissues up to the capsule of the liver are 
infiltrated with 1 % lignocaine. 
Biopsy method: This may be done by either Vim­
Silverman's or Menghini's method. 
a. 
b. Vim-Silverman's method: The trocar and 
cannula are penetrated through the liver 
substance. The trocar is removed and the 
split needle, which cuts the liver tissue, is 
introduced. The cannula is then rotated 
over the split needle so that the cut liver 
tissue remains between the two blades of 
the split needle. The cannula and the split 
needle are now rotated and the needle 
withdrawn. The tissue is collected in Bouin's 
fluid, which is composed of picric acid (75 
parts) acetic acid (5 parts) and formalin 
(25 parts). Throughout the procedure, the 
patient must hold his breath. 
Menghini's method: 3 ml of sterile saline 
solution is drawn into a syringe with the 
J 
Fig 11 4 S1teforl1verb1opsy 
485 

needle attached. The needle is inserted up 
to the intercostal space but not through it. 
About 2 ml of the solution in the syringe 
is injected to clear the needle of any skin 
fragment. Aspiration is now begun and 
maintained. With the patient holding his 
breath in expiration the needle is quickly 
inserted into the liver substance and then 
quickly with-drawn, placing the tip of the 
needle under saline in a glass receptacle. 
By this method there is little distortion 
of the biopsy material and it causes less 
discomfort to the patient. 
6.Seal: After the biopsy, the punctured skin is sealed
with a tincture benzoin seal.
7.Post-procedure orders: T.P.R., B.P to be recorded
half hourly and the patient should not be given
feeds for the next 4 hours. If there is pain,
analgesics may be given.

% lignocaine.
Puncture: The aspiration needle is introduced
at right 
angles to the skin, mid-way between
the two ribs, and advanced till parietal pleura is
punctured which is indicated by a 'give in'. The
needle is now attached to a 50 ml syringe with
a two-way stop cork and about 800-1000 ml of
fluid is removed 
at a time. Aspiration must be
stopped if the patient coughs or complains of
tightness in the chest.

Site: Second intercostal space in the mid 
clavicular line or in the posterior axillary line 
at the level of the apex beat. 
Local anesthetic: Same as pericardia! aspiration. 
Aspiration: The skin of the anterior chest wall 
on the affected site is prepared with Cetavlon, 
iodine and spirit. With the scalpel a small nick is 
made in the skin in the second intercostal space 
a little outside the midclavicular line. With the 
help of a trocar and canula, a disposable plastic 
thoracic tube or a rubber catheter is introduced 
into the intercostal space and connected to an 
underwater seal. The incision should be just 
above the upper border of the lower rib to avoid 
injury to the upper border of the lower rib to 
avoid injury to the intercostal nerves and blood 
vessels. 
If the incision is too near the midline, fatal 
penetration of the superior vena cava on the 
right side may occur. 
In emergency, as in tension pneumothorax, any 
large needle or even a stethoscope tube inserted 
through the stab may save the patient's life. 
Wound closure: The skin incision is sutured.

4. Starve overnight 
Ryle's tube is passed into the stomach and the 
stomach is emptied. The volume of the stomach 
aspirate is noted and tested for mucus, bile, blood, 
starch, etc. 
The tube is taped onto the patient's face and the 
stomach aspirated every 15 minutes for 1 hour 
and titrated for acid. This is the basal acid output 
(BAO) 
Augmented Test: 
a.Augmented histamine test: Antihistaminics
are given to block the H 1 receptors of
histamine. Then 2.4 mg of histamine is
injected every 15 minutes for the next 1
hour. This is replaced nowadays by the
Pentagastrin test.
b.Pentagastrin test: 6 mcg/kg. of pentagastrin
is given intramuscularly and secretions are
collected every 15 minutes for the next 1
hour. Peak acid output (PAO) is calculated
from the highest two consecutive acid
output collections.
c.Hollander's insulin test: Blood is collected
for blood-sugar estimation and this is
followed by injection plain insulin 0.2
units/kg. Every 15 minutes for the next 1
hour gastric samples are collected and acid
output is noted.
Interpretation 
I.Volume: Fasting volume is normally 50 ml. If it
is more than 250 ml it 
suggests pyloric stenosis
or hypersecretion of the gastric juice.
II.Odor: Normal gastric juice has a faintly pungent
odor.
A.Foul and acid smell suggests pyloric stenosis
B.Offensive fecal odor suggests small
intestinal obstruction or gastro-colic fistula
491 

C.Ammoniacal odor suggests uremia
D.No odor suggests achlorhydria
III.Color:
A.Blood red due to blood, confirmed by
chemical test. It may be due to:
1.Trauma by the procedure
2.Hemorrhage fro
a)Peptic ulcer
b)Carcinoma of stomach
c)Esophageal varices
B.Coffee-ground due to conversion of
hemoglobin to acid hematin
C.Dark green color due to bile, confirmed
by chemical test and, on adding water to
the aspirate, the green color is apparent. It
occurs due to regurgitation of the intestinal
contents into the stomach
IV.Mucus: It is normally present and responsible
for the viscosity of the gastric juice. It is present
in excess in:
A.Swallowing of saliva and nasopharyngeal
secretions
B.Gastritis
C.Gastric retention
V.Hydrochloric Acid (HCL) Normal: 2 mmol/hr.
for men and 1 mmol/hr. for women.
492 A.Duodenal ulcer: BAO is twice normal or
more and PAO is very high, about 25 mmol/
hr.
B.Zollinger Ellison's syndrome: BAO is 15 m
mol/hr. PAO is the same as BAO.
C.Test for complete vagotomy: After
Hollander's test if PAO is greater than
BAO it suggests vagotomy is incomplete.
If vagotomy is complete PAO=BAO
D.Achlorhydria: It may be false or true:
1.False-Acid is secreted but is
neutralized by saliva, mucus or
regurgitated intestinal juice. Hence
on histamine injection, acid is present
2.True-No rise in acidity following
histamine or pentagastrin injections

13 > Glucose Tolerance Test 
{G.T.T.) 
Glucose tolerance test is a measure of the capacity of 
a person to dispose off glucose administered orally 
or intravenously. 
I.Oral Test
A.Patient is fasting overnight after 3 days of
high carbohydrate diet.

HOURS 2 
! Fig 11.6:Glucosetolerancecurve : 

( 11 > Procedures 
B.Next morning 3 cc of fasting blood and
urine are collected.
C.A solution of I 00 gm of glucose in 200-300
ml of limewater is given by mouth.
D.Blood and urine specimens are obtained
every half hourly for 2-2 1/2 hours.
E.Blood sugar is estimated and urine sugar
is qualitatively analysed.
F.A curve is prepared of time in hours against
blood sugar levels in mg% (Fig. 11.6).
II.Intravenous Test is carried out in patients
who have inadequate absorption of sugar, as
in steatorrhoea. After overnight fast, 20-30
gm of glucose are injected I.V and blood sugar
estimated every halfhourly for 2 hours. In normal
subjects blood sugar reaches fasting level in I
hour.
III.Cortisone G. T. T.: Patient ingests 50 mg cortisone
acetate 8 hour and 2 hour before the test. The test
is then carried out as for oral test. This is a stress
test as cortisone increases neoglycogenesis in
the liver and raises the blood sugar level, which
stimulates the beta cells to secrete more insulin.
Hence it tests the reserve of beta cells.

A. Venepuncture
Indications 
I.To introduce or replace fluids into circulation.
2. 
Site To provide a route for administering parenteral
medication or nutrition, usually in intensive care.
Normally veins on the forearm or wrist are selected. 
If these are difficult, veins of ankle or feet are used. Procedure 
I.Venepuncture: After the clothes have been
removed from the limb a tourniquet should be
applied to distend the veins. The site of puncture
is cleaned with a spirit swab. Heavy hair growth
should be shaved before this is done. The needle
is inserted slightly obliquely through the skin;
pressure causes the bevel to enter the vein. Blood
will enter the syringe. Now the syringe is removed
and the clip set is attached, fixed and dressed.
2. 
3. Post procedure orders: The site should be examined
daily for inflammation. Adding 500 units of
heparin to each 500 ml of fluid infused, reduces
the incidence of sepsis.
Giving sets should be removed after 3-4 days and
immediately after a blood transfusion, as clot
remains in the filter chamber and may harbour
microorganisms.
Problems:
a.No veins are visible
b. Failure to penetrate the veins
c. Failure to flow
d.Appearance of inflammation
Discontinuing the Infusion 
The clip should be turned off to stop the intravenous 
needle is removed and a small sterile dressing is applied. 
Dangers and Complications 
I.Overloading the circulation
2 Thrombophlebitis
3.Hematoma
4.Infection
5.Local swelling and edema if the needle is
displaced out of the vein
6.Air embolism if a new bottle is connected to the
empty tubing directly instead of changing the set
first.
B. Venesection
Indications 
l.To replace fluids into the circulation when veins
are collapsed and the venepuncture is difficult.

To monitor central venous pressure (CVP). 
Sites 
Saphenous vein over the ankle or cephalic vein over 
the arm is usually selected. The basilic vein is selected 
when CVP is to be monitored. 
Procedure 
l.Local anesthesia: The skin and subcutaneous
tissue are infiltrated with lignocaine.
2. 
3. 
494 Incision: For the saphenous vein, an incision
is made half an inch above and lateral to the
medial epicondyle between the biceps and triceps
muscle. The incision is made at right angles to
the long axis of the limbs.
The skin and the subcutaneous tissues are
displaced with the artery forceps. Saphenous vein
is very superficial and easily reached. Cephalic
vein lies in the groove between the biceps and
triceps muscles and superficial to the brachial
artery.
An aneurysm needle is passed below the vein
and two threads are passed around the vein.
In the upper limb, before proceeding further,
radial pulsations are checked on compressing4. 
5. the "cephalic veins". They are not obliterated 
unless brachial artery is mistaken for cephalic 
vein. 
The distal end of the vein is tied and the proximal 
end is caught between the thread. A nick is made 
in the vein and through it the polythene tube is 
passed for a short distance or up to the superior 
vena cava (in upper limbs). 
I. V. drip is connected to the venesection needle.
Skin is sutured and bandaged.
Discontinuing Venesection 
I.V. fluids are stopped. The polythene tube is gently
pulled out. The area is cleaned and one to two stitches
are taken if required. They are removed after 8 days.

Deficit= (Normal serum Na-Actual serum Na) x 
wt (kg) e.g. if serum sodium is 1200, in a 
man of60 kg. 
Deficit= (140 -120) x 60 
= 20 x60 
= 1200 units 

< 11 ) Procedures 
Two-thirds is given as NaCl and one third as N/6 
sodium lactate, i.e 5 liters as NaCl (Normal Saline) 
and 2 1/2 liters as N/6 sodium lactate. 
Potassium lactate 
It is extremely difficult to calculate potassium deficit. 
However it has been estimated that a deficit of 200-
4000 mEq of potassium is required before the serum 
potassium is reduced to less than 3 mEq/L. 
In diabetic ketosis gross deficits of potassium may 
exist with normal serum potassium. 
Whenever possible, potassium deficit must be cor­
rected by oral administration of potassium. If required, 
potassium may be given I. V at a rate not more than 
20mEqhour. 
15 > Subcutaneous 
Infusions 
Considerable quantities of liquid can be given sub­
cutaneously if the rate of absorption into the body is 
hastened by mixing hylase with the fluid 
Site 
1.Outer aspect of the thigh
2.Abdominal wall
3.Lateral
Insertion 
The set is first prepared. The skin is cleaned and the 
needle is inserted just under and parallel to the skin. 
The set is then connected to the subcutaneous needle, 
the clip turned on and the infusion commenced at 80 
drop per minute. 
A small gauze dressing is placed under the hilt of the 
needle and straping is placed over the hilt to secure 
the needle in position. 
Discontinuing the Infusion 
The needle is removed and small occlusive dressing 
applied over the site of injection. 
Problems and Complications 
1.Pain at the site of injection2. 
3. Infection 
Slow absorption of fluids 
16 > Tracheostomy 
Definition: Tracheostomy is an operation by which a 
stoma or window is made in the tracheal wall for the 
purpose of respiration. 
Indications 
1.Respiratory paralysis where prolonged
intubation is required or in patients kept on a
respirator
2.Tetanus
3.Acute laryngeal edema: e.g. Diphtheria, chemical
burns, and inhalation of irritant gases.
4.Excessive tracheobronchial secretions
5.Foreign body in airway
6.Injury to or pressure on larynx
7.Bilateral abductor paralysis of the vocal cords
Procedure 
I.Preanesthetic medications: Inj. atropine 0.6 mg
half an hour before tracheostomy.
2.Position: The patient is put supine with neck
over-extended and chin in the midline.
3.Site: Below isthmus of the thyroid gland
4. 
5. Local anesthesia: The part selected is prepared
and infiltrated with 2% lignocaine
Procedure: A vertical mid-line incision is
taken about 4 ems long, starting from the
suprasternal notch. The skin, platysma and the
superficial fascia are cut. The inner margin of the
sternohyoid muscle is identified and the deep
layer of cervical fascia is cut. Pretracheal fascia
is cut and separated from trachea. The isthmus is
cut between clamps and its ends ligated. 0.5-1.0
ml of 1 % lignocaine is injected into the lumen
of the trachea. The trachea is kept steady with
fingers and the fourth and third tracheal rings
incised from below upwards. A small portion
of 1 to 2 rings is clipped off. The edges of the
tracheal wound are held apart and a proper sized
tracheostomytube (with tapes already threaded)
is introduced. The hooks are removed and tape is
495 

tied. The wound and the tracheostomy are kept 
free of secretions by repeated suctions. The skin 
is sutured at the upper or lower extremity only. 
The wound is dressed. A reel of gauze with an 
encircling tape is placed around the tube and 
changed whenever soiled. 
Complications 
A.During surgery:
1.Injury to the trachea and esophagus
2.False passage
B.Post-operative:
1.Blocked tracheostomy tube
2.Surgical emphysema
3.Infection, hemorrhage and ulcerations
4.Pulmonary: Bronchopneumonia
Post-operative 
1.Inner tube is removed and cleaned at least twice
a day.
2.Outer tube is removed for cleaning on the 10th
day and immediately another tube is introduced.
Later, outer tube is cleaned once a week and then
once a fortnight.

Indications 
A.Decreased tension of oxygen in arterial blood:
1.High altitude
2.Anesthesia
3.Failure ofrespiration
4.Hypoventilation
5.Respiratory disease
6.Right to left shunt
B.Decreased oxygen content in arterial blood:
1.Anemia

4.Methemoglobinemia
5.Sulfhemoglobinemia
496 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
C.Decreased cardiac output:
1.Shock
2.L.V.F.
3.Cardiac arrest
4.Cardiac arrhythmias
5.Poor coronary perfusion
D.Increased oxygen requirement:
1.Hyperpyrexia
2.Hyperthyroidism
In patients with right to left shunt the increase in 
oxygen content is restricted to the fraction of oxygen 
dissolved in plasma. This fraction can be increased 
from 3 ml per blood when breathing air, to 20 ml per 
blood when breathing 100% oxygen. 
Methods 
I.Administration by nasal tube: A flow of 4 liters/
min. is aimed which will produce 33% oxygen in 
alveolar air as compared to 14% oxygen during
normal breathing. A 20 cu ft cylinder will last
over 2 hours. Since oxygen makes mucous
membranes dry it is best given moist and warm
with the help of a Wolfe's bottle.
The disadvantages are:
1.Nasal catheters are irritating
2.Catheter may be blocked by mucus
3.High oxygen concentration cannot be
obtained
II.Administration by mask: Oxygen can be
administered by a B.L.B apparatus, which
consists of three parts:
1.Rubber face mask and head-band
2.Metal connecting device with air-regulating
mechanism with the help of three ports and
expiratory valve
3.Arebreathingrubberbag(730-800ml):Ifa
high concentration of oxygen is needed all
Fig. 11 7 BLB apparatus

< 11 > Procedures 
the ports are closed and the flow of oxygen 
is adjusted so that the bag does not empty 
completely before the end of inspiration. If 
lower concentration suffices one or more 
port may be kept open so that the patient 
breathes partly from the bag and partly 
through the atmosphere. A fine adjustment 
valve regulates the flow of oxygen. 
III.Administration by tent: Oxygen tents are
more comfortable and efficient than nasal
administration. It is of value in those patients
who are restless or disoriented and interfere with
mask and catheters. It is useful to treat severe
shock, pneumonia and collapse.
Humidification 
Techniques of oxygen administration should take into 
consideration the fact that the oxygen is completely dry 
and if administered without adequate humidification, 
will take up moisture from the mucosa of the respira­
tory tract with which it comes into contact. This may 
lead to drying, crusting and inspissation of secretions 
within the respiratory tract. Dried secretions may block 
the airways leading to atelectasis, ventilation-perfusion 
disturbances and provides a nidus for infection. 
Techniques 
1.Bubble humidifier: Oxygen is moistened by
bubbling it through a large quantity of water.
2.Blower humidifier (Temperature of saturated air
is 37°C).
3.Nebulizer: It suspends water droplets (1-10 mm
in diameter) in air. Larger droplets are useless
as they are deposited within the delivery tube.
4.Saline drip through tracheostomy tube at 10-12
drops/min.

18 > Enema 
Definition : Enemas are liquid preparations that are 
injected into the rectum. 
Types 
1.Evacuant enemas are intended to be returned
2.Retention enemas are intended to be retained
Table 11.S : Types of Enemas 
Evacuant Retention 
1. Warm water 1. Starch opium
2. Enema saponis 2. Normal saline 
3. Glycerine 3.Astringent
4.0liveoil 4. Drugs-Chloral hydrate paraldehyde
5.Castoroil 5.Nutrient
6. Turpentine 6. Magnesium sulphate 
7. Barium
Evacuant Enemas 
A.Warm water at 37°C is injected into rectum.
B.Enema saponis is made by dissolving 15 ml of 
green soap in 500 cc of warm water at 37°C. At 
least 5 mins should be taken in injecting it. It is
used to empty the lower bowel in constipation
and in preoperative preparations of patients. It
is sometimes helpful in urinary retention. It has
now replaced by Dulcolax suppositories.
C.Glycerine: 2-4 drachms of glycerine is mixed
with equal volume of water and given rectally.
It acts by irritating the wall of the rectum.
D.Olive oil: 5-10 ft oz of olive oil warmed at 37°C
is given to soften the hard scybala. It should be
followed by soap and water enema in 2-3 hrs.
E.Castor oil: 1-2 ft oz of castor oil is well mixed
with 2-4 fl oz of olive oil and given slowly. It
should be retained for 2-3 hours and followed
by soap and water enema. It is used in severe
constipation with impacted feces.
497 

F.Turpentine: Oil of turpentine 1 /2 fl oz is mixed
with starch or soap and water enema (15 fl
oz for and adult). There must be no floating
globules. Petroleum jelly should be smeared
around the anus to prevent irritation. It is useful
in postoperative distension and in distension
following enteric fever.
Dangers 
1.Ulceration of the rectum
2.It may get absorbed and damage the kidneys.
Retention Enemas 
A.Starch opium enema: This is prepared by taking
3 gm of starch and making a smooth paste with
cold water is added ( about 2 fl oz). To this 10-40
minims of opium is added and heated to 37° C.
It is injected by glass syringe or catheter rubber
tubing, and syringe barrel. It is given for relief
of pain or to treat excessive diarrhea.
B.Normal saline enema: This is sometimes given
to counteract shock or dehydration. Patient
can absorb up to 2-3 liters of fluids in 24 hours
and the danger of I. V. infusion is avoided. N / 5
normal saline is used.
C.Astringent enema: It is ordered in sydentary and
ulcerative conditions of rectum and colon. It is
injected very gently and the patient is encouraged
to retain it as long as possible. The amount is
gradually increased up to 1-2 1/2 liters. Silver
nitrate in distilled water (1 :5000 increased to
l:500tannicacid (3%) or alum (3%) maybe used.
The patient lies on the back with hips raised. A
morphine or cocaine suppository may be given
earlier.
D.Medicinal enema: Chloral hydrate, paraldehyde
and some antibiotics may be given rectally.
Initially bowel is cleared with an evacuant enema.
After 1 hour medicinal enema is given. A pad
of cotton wool is pressed on the anus when the
tube is removed to assist retention.
E.Barium enema: A low residue diet is given for
three days preceding the examination. Two
bowel washes are given, one on the previous
evening and the other in the morning on the day
of the examination. Rectum must be evacuated
thoroughly till the returning fluid is clear; as fecal
498 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
residues in the colon and rectum may simulate 
new growths during the X-ray examination. 
Two Dulcolax suppositories 1 hour prior to the 
procedure may be used instead. Two lbs ofbarium 
sulphate mixed with mucilage of tragacanth is 
diluted with two liters of hot water to bring the 
mixture of 37°C. This is injected slowly into 
the rectum by a rubber catheter and funnel. 
The column of fluid is watched by intermittent 
screening and radiographs are taken later. The 
flow ofbarium can be regulated by a control clip. 
At the end of the examination of contents of the 
lower bowel can be siphoned off into the pail. 
F.Nutrient enema: Predigested food can be given
rectally as rectum can absorb fluids.
G.Magnesium sulphate: Epsom salts 1-2 oz is
dissolved in 4-8 fl oz ofboiling water and cooled.
It is used to reduce raised intracranial pressure by
osmotically drawing fluid into the gut. It should
be given slowly and retained as long as possible.
Procedure 
Position: The patient is brought on the right side of the 
bed and turned to his left side with knees bent up. The 
foot end of the bed may be raised to ensure that the 
fluid may travel to the cecum. 
Procedure: The temperature of the solution is tested and 
the tip of the catheter lubricated. Some of the solution 
is allowed to run through the apparatus to remove it. 
The catheter is nipped and the left forefingers placed 
on the anus, the catheter is placed for 8-10 cm into 
the rectum. The can is then raised about a foot above 
the level of the patient and at least 5 min are taken to 
give the enema. 
After giving the enema, the tube is withdrawn and the 
patient is covered. Premature return of enema can be 
prevented by pressing a folded towel against the anus 
or holding the buttocks together. The bedpan is placed 
under the patient when he asks for it. 
The result of the enema should be noted-whether the 
fluid has been returned clear, colored or accompanied 
by a stool, and whether distension, if present, is relieved. 
After use, the rectal tube should be flushed throughly 
with cold water, washed with warm soapy water to 
remove the lubricant and boiled for 5 minutes. 

< 11 ) Procedures 
19 Parenteral 
_ _1:iy�eralimentation 
In a critically ill patient, increased metabolic demands 
leads to negative nitrogen balance, if the increased 
calories and proteins demands are not met with. 
Parenteral hyperalimentation is a therapeutic method 
of providing these to the critically ill patient. The usual 
500 ml of 5% dextrose solution only provides 25 gm of 
glucose and 100 calories. Even if 3 liters of such fluid 
is given only 600 calories would be provided, whereas 
the minimum requirement would be 1400 calories. 
Hence parenteral solution should be so composed as 
to provide at least 1500 calories per day. 
Composition of Fluid 
The fluid for hyperalimentation should contain energy 
containing substrates like carbohydrates and fat, ni­
trogenous source ( amino acids), electrolytes, minerals, 
vitamins, trace elements and water. 
Glucose is the most physiological, cheapest and least 
toxic energy substrate. However, 5% glucose solu­
tions would be inadequate and concentrated glucose 
solutions are hyperosmolar and cause irritation and 
thrombosis when injected in the peripheral vein. 
Hence, concentrated glucose is administered only 
into the central jugular vein or superior vena cava 
via a catheter. 
A mixture of all essential and non-essential amino acids 
in appropriate proportion must be given to promote 
protein synthesis and achieve positive nitrogen bal­
ance. The calorie-nitrogen ratio is 150 calories to 1 
gm nitrogen. The ratio of essential and non-essential 
amino acids is 2 : 3. It is given as casein hydrolysate or 
a mixture of crystalline synthetic amino acids. 
Intravenous fats are as effective as glucose in sparing 
proteins and providing positive nitrogen balance. It 
has low osmolality and provides essential fatty acids, 
phosphate and concentrated source of energy. It can 
be given as 10% Safflower oil or 10% soya bean oil 
(Liposyn; Intralipid). A 1 : 1 mixture of glucose and 
lipids curtails the problems related to infusion oflarger 
amount of glucose as well as lowers plasma fatty acids 
concentration. 
About 2-3 liters offluids are required daily. Sodium and 
chloride are required to maintain osmolality and acid base balance. Potassium, magnesium and phosphates 
are required for nitrogen retention and tissue forma­
tion. Calcium prevents demineralization ofbones and 
tetany. Vitamins and trace elements like zinc, copper, 
chromium, selenium and iodides also must be infused.

1 > Blood Collection 
Blood for hematological investigations can be collected 
either from a peripheral vein, an artery or capillaries. 
Venous blood is preferred for most hematological in­
vestigations. Capillary blood can be nearly as accurate 
as venous blood if a free flow of blood is obtained and 
there is no dilutional error due to tissue fluids. However, 
it is used only in infants under 1 year or when it is not 
possible to collect venous blood. 
Peripheral Venous Blood 
1.The upper part of the arm is constricted by
applying a tourniquet to hinder the venous return
without obstructing the radial pulse.
2.The forearm area is cleaned with spirit (70%
ethanol) and the patient is asked to clench the
fist to make the veins prominent. The median
cubital vein is most commonly used.
3.The vein is fixed by slight traction and the needle
(20 or 21G) with the bevel upwards is inserted
at an angle of 15° to the skin. The needle hub is
colored according to its gauge (e.g. pink: 18G,
yellow: 20G, green: 21G, black: 22G)
A scalp vein needle ("butterfly" needle or
"Winged Infusion Set") is sometimes used for
infants and for patients with small veins or veins
that may have a tendency to collapse.
4.Blood will flow into the syringe when the needle
enters the vein correctly. The clenched fist is
released.
5.After collecting the required quantity of blood,
the tourniquet is released and the needle is
quickly withdrawn. Pressure is applied with
cotton wool over the puncture site for 3-5 mins.
6.Blood is transferred to the appropriate containersand the last few drops put on slides for preparing 
direct peripheral smears. 
Complications of Venepuncture 
Syncope, hematoma, bleeding (if bleeding disorder 
present), thrombophlebitis, thrombosis ofvein, trans­
mission of hepatitis/ AIDS (if contaminated needles 
or syringes used). 
Capillary Blood 
1.The site selected is usually the fingertip or earlobe
in adults or the big toe or heel in infants.
2.The selected site is massaged or warmed and
cleaned with spirit or alcohol.
3.The skin is air dried because if it remains wet,
blood will run all over and not collect into a
drop. Residual alcohol can also cause hemolysis.
4.The skin 
is raised into a ridge. The sterile lancet
or blade is plunged to a depth of2-3mm with the
index finger and then released. The blade should
cut transversely to the axis of the finger.
5.From the wound large drops of blood should
exude spontaneously. If the flow of blood is not
spontaneous, pressure should be exerted on the
skin in an outward direction to open the wound
more widely. Squeezing should be avoided as it
stops the flow and also adds tissue fluid to the
blood, making cell counts inaccurate.
6.The first two drops are wiped off (since
they contain excess tissue fluid) and when a
sufficiently large drop has again accumulated,
it is used for filling the required capillary tube
or pipette.
7.Direct smears can be made from drops collected
onto slides.

8.When all the required blood has been collected
the finger should be cleaned with a cotton swab
and pressure applied until bleeding stops.
Arterial Blood 
Only arterial blood accurately reflects the amount of 
p02 transferred from the lungs. Arterial blood gases 
consist of three tests (pO 2, pCO 2 and pH) and provide 
useful information about the respiratory status and the 
acid base balance of patients with pulmonary (lung) 
disease and other critically ill patients. 
Sites for collection 
1.Radial artery (most convenient)
2.Brachia! artery
3.Femoral artery (largest of the three)
2 > Pre�aration of Blood 
I.Blood Smear
502 Preparation (slide method)
1.A drop of venous or capillary blood ( direct
smear) or EDTA-anticoagulated blood
(indirect smear) is placed about 1 or 2
cm from one end of a pre cleaned slide. A
greasy slide should not be used (it causes
uneven smear preparation).
2.Immediately, another slide with a smooth
edge (spreader) is placed at an angle of25° to
30° and moved backwards to make contact

with the drop. A spreader with a ragged 
edge should not be used since it causes 
neutrophils to collect at the tail end of the 
smear ("tailing") and inaccurate differential 
counts. 
3.The drop of blood should spread out along
the line of contact of the spreader with the
slide.
4.The blood film is then spread by a rapid,
smooth, forward movement of the spreader
until all the blood has spread or the edge
of the slide is reached. The ideal thickness
for the smear is such that there is some
overlap of red cells throughout majority
of the length of the smear with separation
and no distortion towards the tail of the
film. A thick smear, required for detecting
malarial parasites and microfilaria, should
be of such a thickness that printed matter
can just be seen through the smear.
Fixing 
The air-dried blood smear is fixed by covering 
the film with acetone-free methyl alcohol for l 
minute. This denatures proteins. It is required to 
prevent hemolysis of the RBCs when they come 
in contact with water in which some stains are 
dissolved, e.g. Giemsa's stain. 
Methanol in a Coplin jar ( 4-6 dips of the slide) 
can also be used as a fixative. 
Fixation is not separately required for Leishman's 
or Wright's stain as it is carried out simultaneously 
whilst staining. 
Staining 
Romanowsky dyes are used for staining blood 
films. They are made up of a combination of acid 
and basic dyes. Methylene blue or toluidine blue 
is used as the basic stain, whereas eosin or Azure 
B is used as the acid stain. The nucleus and the 
neutrophil granules are basophilic and stain blue. 
Hemoglobin is acidophilic and stains red. 
Various modifications available are Leishman's, 
Wright's, Giemsa's and Jenner's stains. The pH is 
very critical in all the stains. 
Composition of Leishman 's stain 
Leishman powder 1.5 g dissolved in l liter of 
methanol 

12 > Hematology 
Wright's or Leishman's staining 
1. The slide is covered with the stain for
5 minutes taking care not to allow it to dry.
2.The stain is then diluted with an equal
volume of buffered water (mixing the two
by blowing on it through a pipette) and
allowed to further act for 10 minutes.
3.The slide is then flooded with a stream of
running tap water. Stain should never be
poured off because a precipitate of stain
will be deposited on the slide.
4.The slide is allowed to dry in a slanting
position.
Giemsa 's staining 
1.The blood film is fixed with acetone-free
methyl alcohol for 1 min and dried.
2.Giemsa's stain (1:10 dilution) is poured
over the slide and kept for 20 minutes or
longer.
3. The stain is washed off with distilled or tap
water.
4.The slide is allowed to dry.
Thick Smear staining (Field's Stain)
This is a quick method for staining thick smears 
for malarial parasites. 1.The smear is allowed to air-dry for 30
minutes.
2.It is then immersed in a jar of polychromed
methylene blue stain for 3 seconds. The slide
is then immersed in tap water and gently
shaken.
3.The slide is dipped in eosin stain for 3
seconds, washed in tap water and allowed
to dry.
Buffy Coat Preparation 
This is used to study the morphology of WBCs, 
platelets or abnormal cells after concentrating 
them. To detect LE cells for the diagnosis ofSLE, 
blood is defibrinated using glass beads and then 
a huffy coat is prepared. 
Method 
1.EDTA anticoagulated blood ordefibrinated
blood is filled in Wintrobe's tube and
centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 mins.
2.The topmost serum/plasma layer is
discarded.
3.The next layer, above the packed red cell

5.The slides are air-dried and stained as above.
II.Anticoagu lated Blood
A number of anticoagulants are available for
various investigations.
1.EDTA: (Ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid):
It is used as disodium or dipotassium salt
1.2 mg per ml ofblood. Dipotassium EDTA
is more soluble than sodium EDTA and is 
therefore preferred for cell counters and
other investigations. It is the most powerful
calcium-chelating agent and gives the best
preservation of cell morphology. Smears
can be made up to 3 hours after blood
collection. Platelet clumping is inhibited
so it is preferred for platelet counts.
2.Citrate: It is used as a 0.106 M trisodium
citrate dihydrate solution (3.2%); hence
it dilutes the cellular elements and is not
useful for cells counts. It is useful for
coagulation studies and W estergren ESR
estimations. In the former, 1 part of citrate
to 9 parts of blood is taken, whereas in the
latter, 1 part of citrate to 4 parts of blood
is taken. It acts by binding calcium in a
soluble unionized complex.
4.Heparin: It inhibits all the steps of
coagulation reversibly; hence its effect
slowlydisappears asheparinis neutralized or
metabolized. It is used in the concentration
of 15 ± 2.5 JU per ml of blood and used
for osmotic fragility tests, electrolyte
estimation, immuno-phenotyping and
arterial blood gases.
5.Double Oxalate: Potassium oxalate
causes shrinkage of the red cells whereas
ammonium oxalate causes swelling. To
balance these two effects, a mixture of the
two in the ratio of 3 parts of ammonium
oxalate to 2 parts of potassium oxalate
is used at a concentration of 2 mg/ml of
blood. Oxalate prevents clotting by binding
504 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
calcium to form an insoluble salt. WBC 
morphology is not well preserved because 
the neutrophils often phagocytose the 
precipitated calcium oxalate. 
6.ACD solution (Acid Citrate Dextrose
Solution) is used in blood banking.
7.CPDA solution ( Citrate phosphate dextrose
adenine solution) is used in blood banking.
8.Sodium fluoride-potassium oxalate
combination is used for plasma glucose
determination. Fluoride inhibits glycolytic
enzymes and prevents lowering of glucose.
Oxalate acts as an anticoagulant.
III.Diluted Blood
Visual counting of red cells, white cells,
eosinophils, reticulocytes and platelets require
dilution of the anticoagulated blood using an
appropriate pipette. Colorimetric estimation of
hemoglobin also requires diluted blood.
IV.Plasma
1.The collected blood is transferred to test
tube containing the specified type and
quantity of anticoagulant.
2.The blood and anticoagulant are mixed by
inverting the test tube several times.
3.The blood is centrifuged at 2000-3000 rpm
for 10 mins.
4.The supernatant plasma is transferred to
another test tube and stored on ice till tested.

V.Serum
1.The collected blood is transferred to a plain
glass or plastic test tube and allowed to
clot undisturbed for 1-2 hrs at 37° C.
2.If the clot has not completely retracted,
it is gently detached from the walls of the
test tube by means of a toothpick or an
applicator stick or a sealed Pasteur pipette.
3.The tube containing the clotted blood is then
centrifuged at 2000-3000 rpm for 10 mins.
4.The supernatant serum is carefully removed
with a pipette and stored at 4°C till tested.
VI.Cell Suspension
1.A few drops of fresh anticoagulated blood
or capillary blood is mixed with about 4 ml
of physiological saline.
2.If washed red cell suspension is required,
the red cell are washed 4 times in five
times their volume of physiological saline
with high-speed centrifugation between
each wash. After the final wash, the red
cells are suspended in saline to give a 10%
suspension and used within 2 hrs.
3 > Hemoglobin Estimation 
The hemoglobin (Hb) content in a blood sample may 
be determined by measurement of its color, its power 
of combining with oxygen or carbon monoxide or 
by its iron content. The clinical methods for routine 
purposes are all based on color or light intensity 
matching techniques. 
I.Sahli's Method (Acid-hematin)
Principle
Hemoglobin (Hb) is converted to acid hematin
vby addition ofO.l N hydrochloric acid (HCI)
and the resulting brown color is compared with
standard brown glass reference blocks.
Method
1.0.1 NHCiisplacedin the special graduated
tube to the 20% mark.
2.Capillary or EDTA blood is drawn up to the
20ml mark in the Sahli pipette. The blood
is added to the acid in the tube, the pipetterinsed thoroughly and mixture is stirred 
well. 
3.The mixture is allowed to stand for 10 min.
for complete conversion to acid hematin.
4.The solution is diluted with a few drops
of distilled water at a time, until the
color matches with the standard glass
reference block of the comparator of Sahli' s
hemoglobinometer. Natural light is used as
a background.
5.The height of the solution in the graduated
tube corresponds to the Hb content (Hb%
or Hb g%) (100% Hb= 14.5 g/dl Hb)
Sources of Error 
1.Visual error in color matching.
2.All hemoglobins are not converted to acid
hematin by HCl acid, and therefore lower
values.
3.Color is· not stable and becomes lighter
after 1 hour.
II.Cyanmethemoglobin Method
Principle
Hb, methemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin (but
not sulphemoglobin) are converted to cyanrnet­
hemoglobin when blood is diluted in a solution
containing potassium cyanide and potassium
ferricyanide. The absorbance of the solution is
then measured in a photoelectric colorimeter at
a wavelength of 540 mm or with a yellow-green
filter.
Method
1.20µ1 ofblood are added to 5 ml ofDrabkin's
cyanide -ferricyanide solution and mixed
well.
2.After 10 mins, the absorbance of the
solution i� read against a reagent blank ( or
distilled water) at 540 mm which is adjusted
to an OD of 0.
3.A standard curve (or standard table)
is prepared using cyanmethemoglobin
graded dilutions of a reference solution of
known concentration and using the same
colorimeter. A straight line is obtained and
Beer's Law is followed when absorbance
(OD) is plotted against Hb cone.
505 

4.The Hb value of the test sample can be then
read on the standard graph/table.

Advantages 
1. More accurate since visual matching is 
avoided
2.Certified standards of cyanmethemoglobin
used
3. Hb, methemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin
(but not sulphemoglobin) are converted
to cyanmet-hemoglobin by Drabkin's
solution.
4. Cyanmethemoglobin is stable with time.
Sources of Error 
1.Abnormal plasma proteins or a high
leucocyte count may give erroneously high
Hb content due to turbidity. The latter can
be avoided by centrifuging the diluted
sample. Abnormal plasma proteins can be
solubilised by addition of a detergent e.g.
Nonidet P40.
2.Technical errors in sampling, pipetting,
calibration, etc.
III.Electronic Counters (Refer Pg. 514)
IV.Haldane's Carboxyhemoglobin Method
Hemoglobin is converted to carboxyhemoglobin
(which is bright red in color), by exposing it to
carbon monoxide (CO). It is a relatively accurate
method but CO is dangerous.
V.Oxyhemoglobin Method
506 Hemoglobin is converted to oxyhemoglobin
by mixing blood with a dilute solution of
sodium carbonate or ammonium hydroxide.
The intensity of color obtained is measured
colorimetrically. It is a fast and accurate method.PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
VI.Alkali-hematin Method
Hemoglob in, methemoglobin, carboxy­
hemoglobin and sulphemoglobin are converted
to alkaline hematin by addition of sodium
hydroxide - a strong alkali. It forms a true
solution and the brown color can be read against
comparable standards or in a colorimeter. Fetal
hemoglobin and Hb-Barts are alkali-resistant,
but can be converted by heating in a boiling
water bath for 4 mins or by collecting the blood
first into acid and then adding alkali (acid-alkali
method).

_IT>C'll_ 
PCV or hematocrit value is the volume of packed red 
cells in a given sample ofblood expressed as a percent­
age or fraction of the total blood volume. 
I.Wintrobe's Method
1.EDTA or oxalated blood is filled in
Wintrobe's tube (Fig. 12.2) up to the 100
mm mark using a thin and long Pasteur
pipette starting from the bottom and
gradually withdrawing the pipette as the
blood is expressed. This prevents formation
of air-bubbles in Wintrobe's tube.
2.The tube is centrifuged at 2300 g (3000
rpm) for 30 minutes.
3. Three layers can be seen:
a)Thelowermostlayerofpackedred cells
(PCV). The height of this is recorded
as PCV. The "10" mark represents
100% PCV.
b)The middle layer ofWBC and platelets
(buffy coat).
c)The uppermost layer of plasma.

or leucocytes are increased.
3.The upper layer of plasma which is normally
clear and straw-coloured, may be milky

reddish due to hemolysis/hemoglobinemia.
II.Microhematocrit Method
Two thirds of the capillary tube is filled with
anticoagulated capillary or venous blood and
the other end sealed with plasticine. The tubes
are centrifuged at 12,000 gin a special centrifuge
for 5 minutes. The hematocrit values are read by
using special microhematocrit card readers.
Advantages
1.Capillary blood can be used.
2.Time taken for centrifugation is much less.
3.Smaller amount of blood is needed.
Sources of error 
1.Technical errors due to improper mixing of
blood, use ofhemolysed sample, incorrectanticoagulant concentration, poor sealing 
causing leakage, etc. 
2.Sample more than 6 hours old.
3.Error in reading, centrifugation speed and
time, specimen mix up.
III.Electronic Counters
This can calculate the PCV from the mean red
cell volume (MCV) and red cell count. The
PCV obtained is usually 1.5 to 3% lower than
the microhematocrit value since errors due to
trapped plasma and inadequate oxygenation are
eliminated.
NORMAL PACKED CELL VOLUME 
Males:40-52% 
Females: 36 -48% 
5 > Erythrocyte 
Sedimentation Rate 
(ESR) 
When anticoagulated blood is allowed to stand undis­
turbed in a vertical tube, the red cells tend to fall to the 
bottom forming two layers -the lower red cell layer 
and the upper plasma layer. This occurs in three stages. 
1.Stage of aggregation: The red cells form
rouleaux. This is the most important stage and
factors which affect this stage markedly alter
sedimentation rate.
2.Stage of sedimentation: The larger the aggregates
formed in stage l, the faster the rate of fall.
3.Stage of packing: The individual cells and
aggregates slow down due to crowding.
Methods 
There are two common methods of measuring ESR. 
Westergren's method is more sensitive and accurate. 
Wintrobe's method uses smaller volumes of blood 
and the same tube can be centrifuged later for PCV 
and buffy coat. 
Wintrobe's Method 
1.Blood is drawn by venepuncture and then
collected in a dry bulb containing Wintrobe's
oxalate mixture.
2.After mixing with oxalate, blood is transferred
507 

to the Wintrobe's tube with a Pasteur pipette up 
tomark'O'. 
3.The tube is placed vertically in its stand and the
time is noted.
4.At the end of 1 hour, the reading corresponding
to the top of the red cell layer (inmm) is the ESR.
Westergren's Method 
1.2 ml of blood is added into a tube containing
0.3 ml sodium citrate solution.
2.Blood is drawn into the Westergren's tube up to
'O' mark.
3.The tube is placed vertically in a special stand in
which a spring clip on the top firmly holds the
tube against the rubber at the lower end.
4.At the end of 1 hour, the reading corresponding
to the top of the red cell layer is noted in mm.
This measurement is ESR. (Westergren 1 hr).
NORMAL ESR (using Wintrobe's Method) 
Males: 0-7 mm/hour 
Females: 0-14 mm/hour 
NORMAL ESR (using Westergren's Method) 
Males: 0-1 O mm/hour 
Females: O -20 mm/hour 
Factors Influencing ESR 
1.Plasma: RBCs carry a negative electric charge,
whereas plasma carries a positive charge.
Any condition in plasma that increases its
positive charge increases rouleaux formation
and increases ESR by lengthening stage I.
Fibrinogen, globulin and cholesterol accelerate
whilst albumin retards sedimentation. Hence,
ESR is increased in any condition that increases
fibrinogen (tissue break-down as in infection
and tuberculosis) or globulin (rheumatic fever,
multiple myeloma and kala azar).
2.RB Cs: Increase in blood counts as in polycythemia
decreases ESR due to the jostling ( or pushing one
another) effect on the cells. Low blood counts
in anemia tend to increase the ESR. However,
altered shape of the RBC as in sickle cell anemia
and microcytes in hypochromic anemia tend to
prevent rouleaux formation and decrease ESR.
508 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
3.Physiological variation: ESR is low in infants,
increases up to puberty, then decreases up to
old age when again it increases. It is greater in
women than men. It increases after the third
month of pregnancy and returns to normal by
about third week postpartum.
Causes of Increased ESR 
1.Physiological: Pregnancy, menstruation, old age,
females
2.Anemia
3.Infectious diseases: TB (maximum in miliary
TB)
4.Inflammato ry conditions, cell destruction,
toxemia: Rheumatic fever, rheumatoid arthritis,
SLE, ankylosing spondylitis, nephrosis.
5.Myocardial infarction
6.Shock
7.Post-operative states
8.Malignancies
9.Hypergammaglobulinemia : AIHA, multiple
myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia
Causes of Decreased ESR 
1.Physiological: Newborns due to polycythemia,
males
2.Polycythemia
3.Congenital spherocytosis
4.Sickle cell disease
5.Hypofibrinogenemia
6.Allergic states
Significance of ESR 
1.Changes in ESR indicates presence and intensity
of an inflammatory process, they are not
diagnostic of any specific condition.
2.ESR has prognostic value. Elevated ESR (as in
rheumatic fever or tuberculosis), if returns to
normal suggests improvement in clinical course.
3.Extreme elevation of ESR is seen in malignancies,
hematological diseases (e.g. myeloma), renal
diseases (e.g. azotemia), collagen diseases (e.g.
RA, SLE, polymyalgia rheumatica), severe

< 12 ) Hematology 
infections ( e.g. osteomyelitis, subacute bacterial 
endocarditis) drug fever, cirrhosis, etc. 
Sources of Error 
1.Technical Errors: Tilting of ESR tube, longer
length of tube, high room temperatures and
longer time increase ESR.
2. 
3. Sample: Anticoagulant concentration, clotted or
hemolysed blood sample.
Equipment: Clean ESR tubes are essential.
6 > Reticulocyte Count 
Reticulocytes are juvenile red blood cells released into 
the blood stream from the bone marrow. They circulate 
for about 24 hours before maturing into erythrocytes. 
Reticulocytes are slightly larger than mature RBCs and 
contain a network of granular or filamentous reticulum 
which stains blue with supravital staining (i.e. stain­
ing ofliving cells). The reticulum contains ribosomal 
RNA from remnants of Golgi apparatus, mitochondria 
and other cytoplasmic organelles. Reticulocytes stain 
polychromatic with Romanowsky stains. 
Reticulocyte Stain 
Brilliant cresyl blue 1.0 g (stains reticulum) 
(or new methylene blue) 
Sodium citrate 0.4 g (anticoagulant) 
0.85% Sodium chloride 100 ml (iso-osmolality) 
Method 
l.Two drops of EDTA blood are added to two
drops of just-filtered reticulocyte stain in a test
tube.
2.This is mixed and incubated at 37° C for
30 mins.
3.A thin smear is made, air-dried and examined
using the oil immersion objective.
4.Atleast 1000 RBCs (which stain pale blue)
are counted and the number of reticulocytes
( showing deep blue or purple reticulin precipitate
or granules) is simultaneously counted.

4.Response after bone marrow transplant can be
monitored.
5.In alpha thalassemia, HbH inclusions stain with

7 > Osmotic Fragility of 
RBCs 
Osmotic fragility is an index of resistance offered by 
red blood cells to hemolysis. 
When RBCs are placed in 0.85% saline, there is no 
change in the water content of RB Cs. If the salt con­
centration is increased, water passes out of the red cells 
which become crenated. If the salt concentration is 
reduced, water enters the red cells which then hemolyse. 
Method 
1. 
2. 
3. Heparinized or defibrinated blood is used for 
the test (Additional salt in oxalated or citrated 
blood alters the toxicity, hence they are avoided). 
12 test tubes are taken. Each is filled with 5 ml 
of different concentrations of sodium chloride 
(0.80, 0.75, 0.65, 0.55, 0.50, 0.45, 0.40, 0.35, 0.30, 
0.20, 0.1 and 0.0 per cent) solutions, pH 7.4. 
To each test tube 0.5 ml of well-aerated blood is 
added, mixed and allowed to stand for 30 minutes 
at room temperature. 
NORMAL OSMOTIC FRAGILITY OF RED CELLS 
Hemolysis begins at about 0.50% and is complete at 
0.30% concentration {at RT for 30 mins). 
Mean Corpuscular Fragility (MCF) is 0.45% or slightly 
lower. 
4.The amount of hemolysis in each tube is noted
in a photoelectric colorimeter with a green
filter (540 nm). The supernatant fluid from
0.80% (Tube 1) is used as a blank as there is no
hemolysis and that for 0.0% (Tube 12) is used
as 100% hemolysis.
Percent hemolysis= O.D. of individual tube X 100 
O.�. of tube with 100% hemolysis
5.A fragility curve is drawn by plotting percent
hemolysis on the Y-axis and concentration of
sodium chloride on the X-axis.
6.The mean corpuscular fragility (MCF) is the
concentration of NaCl which causes 50%
hemolysis.
Significance 
1.Spherocytes which are spherical in shape are
unable to swell further, hence they are highly
fragile and osmotic fragility is increased.
510 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
Hemolysis may start at 0. 75% and be completed 
at 0.40%. MCF is 0.5% or higher. 
2.Target cells of thalassemia as well as hypochromic
cells of iron deficiency anemia are relatively
flat, and can swell a lot before rupturing. Hence
fragility is decreased to below 0.30%. MCF is
0.35 to 0.40%.
8 > Total Red Cell Count ----
The RBC count is done with the improved Neubauer's 
chamber, a coverslip and an RBC pipette. 
The Neubauer's chamber has two ruled stages sepa­
rated by a small gutter. Each chamber has a large ruled 
area of 9 sq mm on each chamber stage. The center 
square, which is used for RBC counting, is divided 
into 25 squares, each of which is further divided into 
16 squares. 
The pipette has three marks, 0.5, 1.0 and 101. It con­
tains a red glass bead inside to facilitate mixing of the 
blood and diluent.

Method 
1.Capillary or EDTA blood is drawn into the pipette
exactly up to the 0.5 mark.
2.RBC diluting fluid is then drawn up to the mark
101 (the blood has been diluted 1:200).
3.Fluid in the bulb is mixed by rapidly rotating the
pipette between the fingers. The first few drops
from the stem of the pipette are discarded because
they have not completely mixed with blood.
4.The Neubauer chamber with the cover slip is
charged by holding the pipette slightly inclined
and gently releasing the pressure to allow a
small volume of fluid to flow down. This will be
attracted under the coverslip by capillary action.
It is important to avoid air bubbles under the
coverslip and not to overrun the fluid into the
gutters.
5.The cells are allowed to settle for 2-3 mins.
6. The ruling is at first brought into focus using the
low-power objective. The central large square
is brought into the field of vision and the high
power objective is now used to count RBCs in
five ( the central and four corner) squares. Each
of these is divided into 16 squares and thus 80
small squares are counted. Depth of fluid is 0.1
mm below the cover slip.
Calculation 
Area of each square= 1/5 X 1/5 = 1/25 mm2 
Area of 5 squares= 5 X 1/25 = 1/5 mm2

9 Total White Cell Count 
Total WBC count or TLC (total leukocyte count) is 
done with Neubauer's chamber and WBC pipette. 
Since WBCs are present in much smaller numbers 
than RBCs the dilution required is much less. 
A WBC pipette has three marks 0.5, 1.0 and 11. It 
contains a white glass bead inside to facilitate mixing 
of the blood and diluent.

greater than 4 per 100 WBCs in the DLC, a correction 
is needed in the TLC.

Causes of Leucocytosis/Leucopenia 
The most common cause is an increase/decrease in 
neutrophils. 
Causes of Neutrophil Leucocytosis 
(Neutrophils >11.0 x 109/L) 
A.Physiolog ical: Exercise, pregnancy, 
period, exposure to cold.neonatal 
B.Drugs: Epinephrine, steroids, GCSF
C.Pathological:
1.Infection with pyogenic organisms
2.Non-infective inflammations
3.Vascular: Myocardial infarction, pulmonary
embolism, acute hemorrhage
4.Trauma and following surgery
5.Toxic: Uremia, hepatic coma, chemicals
6.CML, polycythemia vera, myelofibrosis
7.Malignant neoplasms
Causes of Neutrophil Leucopenia 
(Neutrophils <4.0 x 109/L) 
1.Starvation and debility
2. 
3. 
4. Overwhelming infections and toxemia in
old people
Infections like typhoid, measles, malaria,
kala-azar, hepatitis, influenza, etc.
Hypersplenism
5.Bone marrow failure: a plastic anemia, leukemia,
chemotherapy, megaloblastic anemia
5.Drugs: Sulphonamides, chlorpromazine,
diuretics
Sources of Error in Counts using Neauber 
chamber 
1.Equipment errors: Inaccurate pipette graduations
or depth of ruled area of chamber, unclean
chamber.
2.Blood sampling errors: Inadequate mixing of
blood, blood clots in sample
3.Technical errors: Improper charging of chamber,

< 12 > Hematology 
inadequate wiping of pipette, overflowing of 
chamber, contamination of diluting fluid. 
4.Field errors: Unequal distribution of cells
5.Calculation errors
10 > Platelet Count 
A peripheral smear prepared from EDTA anticoagu­
lated blood helps to judge roughly whether adequate 
platelet are presents. Usually, if2 to 10 platelets per 100 
red cells or if clumps of platelets are present, it suggests 
that platelets are adequate. The size and morphology 
of the platelets can also be studied by peripheral smear 
examination. They are bluish spherical or oval struc­
tures, 2 - 4 microns in diameter. With Romanowsky's 
stain azure granules are seen in the hyaline, light blue 
cytoplasm; no nucleus is present. 
Platelet counts can be made by visual counting or 
electronic counters. Accuracy in visual counting ( direct 
or indirect method) is only achieved by scrupulous 
cleanliness during blood collection and preparation 
and by experience in differentiating platelets from 
extraneous matter. Phase contrast microscopy helps 
considerably in recognising and counting platelets. 
Direct Method 
I. 0.02 ml (20ml) of EDTA anticoagulated blood
is diluted and mixed with 2 ml of diluting fluid
(same as RBC diluting fluid with 1-2 drops of
1 % brilliant cresyl blue). Dilution is 1:100.
2. 
3. Capillary blood and an RBC pipette can be used
to prepare a dilution of 1:200.
1 % ammonium oxalate can also be used as a
diluent in which red cells are lysed.
After2 minutes an improved Neubauer's chamber
is charged and placed under a petri dish with
moist filter paper for 20 minutes. This allows the
platelet to settle on the surface of the counting
chamber. The moist filter paper keeps the air
moist and prevents drying of the chamber.
Platelets appear as highly refractile particles under
the high power lens. Platelets are counted in one
square mm (central large square). At least 100
platelets must be counted.Calculation 
IfN cells are counted in 1 sq. mm (O.l µl volume) of 
1:100 dilution of blood, then the platelet count per 
litre is: 
= No. of platelets counted X dilution X 106 
Volume (µI) 
= N X 100 X 106/ 0.1 µl 
= N X 109 (per litre) 
Sources of Errors 
I.Same as for RBC/WBC counts using Neubauer's
chamber.
2. If platelet clumps are present, specimen should
not be used.
3.Platelet count should roughly tally with the
peripheral smear observation.
Indirect Method 
I.A drop of 14% magnesium sulfate is placed on
the fingertip and the finger is pricked through
it to dilute the blood at once in order to prevent
the clumping or disintegration of platelets.
2.With a drop, a thin smear is prepared and stained
with Leishman's or Wright's stain.
3.With another drop of blood, the RBC count is
done simultaneously.
4.On the smear 1000 RBCs are counted and the
number of platelets seen whilst counting is noted.

11 > Electronic Cell Counters 
The advent of electronic cell counters (hematologi­
cal autoanalysers) has revolutionised the complete 
blood count (CBC). It has increased the accuracy, 
practicability and diagnostic value of red cell counts. 
In addition, most counters also determine white cell 
counts, hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit (PCV), 
red cell indices (MCV, MCH, MCHC) and platelet 
counts. More advanced counters offer DLC, red cell size 
distribution, platelet size distribution and abnormal 
514 PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
cell information. Standardisation and strict quality 
control in all electronic counters is very important. 
Visual counting is still used in some laboratories and 
as a reference method for calibration of electronic 
counters. The basic principles of electronic cell counters 
are based on one of the three principles: 
I.Electrical Impedance Principle ( Coulter
Principle): Blood is highly diluted with a
particle-free buffered electrolyte solution and
made to flow through an aperture tube of specific
dimensions.
A constant electric potential is maintained
between an electrode in the sample container
and one inside the aperture tube. Blood cells
are poor conductors of electricity and when a
cell displaces some of the conductive fluid in
the aperture tube, the electrical resistance is
increased. Each increase in resistance is read
as a pulse, the amplitude of which is directly
proportional to the cell volume. An amplitude
discriminator selects the minimal pulse height
to be counted.
For leucocyte counts and hemoglobin estimation
the red cells are lysed and Hb converted to
cyanmethemoglobin.
2.Optical Principle (e.g. Technicon system): A
diluted red cell suspension is allowed to flow
through a cuvette in the form of an optical
chamber, which is aligned to a dark field
condenser. The impulses produced due to the
light scattered by each cell, as it passes the
focussed light, are converted into electrical
impulses in a photomultiplier tube and then
amplified and counted.
3.Laser Principle (e.g. Ortho system): A diluted
red cell suspension is injected into a stream of
buffered saline in which the cells flow in single file
past a laser beam. A photovoltaic cell detects the
light, which is scattered and diffracted by the cells.
The pulses (whose magnitude is proportional to
cell volume) are electronically accumulated and
counted.
12 > Red Cell Indices 
The mean corpuscular volumes (MCV), mean corpus-

< 12 > Hematology 
cular Hb (M CH) and mean corpuscular Hb concentra­
tion (MCHC) are 'Absolute' values calculated from the 
results ofHb content, total red cell count and PCV and 
are used in the classification of anemias.

The initial diagnostic approach to hematological 
disorders is peripheral smear (PS) examination and 
blood cell counting. PS examination includes: 
•Red cell morphology
•Differential leucocyte count (DLC)
•Platelet morphology and assessment of count
•Abnormal cells
•Parasites and microfilaria

13 > Red Cell Mor�holog _i_ 
An area of the blood smear where the cells are well 
separated is selected to study the morphology of the 
cells. The smear is therefore examined first under low 
to high power which helps to detect parasites like 
microfilaria and helps to select a suitable area for the 
study of red cell morphology. A drop of oil is then 
placed on the slide which is examined under the oil 
immersion lens ( 100 X) 
A.Size
NormalRBCs
They are 6.0 to 8.5 microns in diameter and are
called normocytes (Fig 12.6). They are roughlythe size of the nucleus of small lymphocytes. 
Their biconcave shape gives an approximately 
one-third central pale area. MCV is 78-95 fl. 
Mature red cells have no nucleus. 
Microcytes 
These are smaller (less than 6 microns in 
diameter) cells which are found in iron 
deficiency anemia, various types of thalassemia, 
spherocytosis, severe anemia of chronic disease. 
MCV is less than 78 fl. 
Macrocytes 
These are larger cells(> 9 microns in diameter) 
which are found in megaloblastic anemias, 
liver disease, alcoholism, increased erythropoiesis 
(reticulo-cytosis), myelodysplasia. MCV is greater 
than 95 fl. 
Anisocytosis 
This refers to an increase in variation of red cell 
size. It is a common, non-specific abnormality 
in many hematological disorders. Anisocytosis 
may be due to microcytes, macrocytes or both 
being present. 
B.Shape
Normal red cells are shaped like biconcave discs.
Poikilocytosis
Abnormal shaped red cells are called poikilocytes.

516 Poikilocytosis is a non-specific abnormality 
in many hematological disorders. Marked 
poikilocytosis is found in myelofibrosis, 
dyserythropoietic anemias, extramedullary 
hemopoiesis. 
Spherocytes 
These are small spherical cells with no central 
pallor, found in hereditary spherocytosis, 
autoimmune hemolytic anemia, ABO hemolytic 
disease of the newborn, septicemia. Usually M CV 
is decreased and MCHC is increased. 
Target cells ( or codocytes) 
These have a central round area stained pink 
around which is a colorless zone rimmed by 
a border of normal pink. They are found in 
thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, hypochromic 
anemia, following splenectomy or dehydration 
and in liver diseases. 
Elliptocytes ( or ovalocytes) 
These are oval-shaped cells, found in large 
numbers in hereditary elliptocytosis. Macro­
ovalocytes are seen in megaloblastic anemia. 
Dacrocytes ( or tear drop cells) 
These are tear drop shaped cells, found in fibrosis, 
severe dyserythropoiesis, some hemolytic 
anemias. 
Sickle cells ( or drepanocytes) 
These are sickle or crescent shaped cells found 
in sickle cell anemia due to crystallisation 
of the abnormal hemoglobins at low oxygen 
tension. These cells are best demonstrated by 
adding a drop of blood and then preparing a 
wet preparation sealed with vaseline. 
Stomatocytes 
These have a narrow slit-like central area and are 
found in stomatocytosis. They may be artefacts. 
Schistocytes ( or keratocytes) 
These are irregular red cell fragments found in 
microangiopathic hemolytic anemias ( e.g. DIC, 
HUS, TTP, burns, snake bite). 
Acanthocytes ( or spur cells) 
These are irregular cells with rounded 
projections seen in uremia, liver disease, 
abetalipoproteinemia, chorea-like hereditary 
neuropathy, etc. PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
Echinocytes ( or Burr cells or crenated cells) 
These are ameba-shaped cells seen in uremia, 
liver disease or post-splene ctomy. They are 
usually artefacts. 
Rouleaux formation 
Red cells look like a pile of coins. It is 
characteristic of hypergammaglobulinemia 
and if found, myeloma or macroglobulinemia 
is suspected. ESR is usually high. 
C.Color
Normal red cells have a central one-third area
of pallor.
Hypochromia is when this pale area is
increased and suggests decreased hemoglobin
concentration or abnormal thinness of the
red cells e.g. in anemias, thalassemias, chronic
infections, etc.
Hyperchromia is when cells appear without
central pallor. This does not indicate increased
hemoglobin concentration but suggests
altered shape of the cell or altered thickness of
the membrane (megaloblastic anemia,
spherocytosis, neonatal blood).
Polychromatophilia is when the red cells stain
blue. It indicates reticulocytosis.
Erythrocyte dimorphism is the presence of
normal and hypochromic microcytic cells. It can
occur in iron deficiency anemia responding to
iron therapy, following blood transfusion or in
sideroblastic anemia.
D.Inclusions
Basophilic stippling
These are small blue or black granules in red
cells seen in thalassemia, aplastic anemia, lead
poisoning, megaloblastic anemia, unstable
hemoglobins, liver disease, infections, etc.
Howell-Jolly bodies
These are remnants of the nucleus seen as small,
round, dark pink-purple particles near the
periphery of the cell. They are found following
splenectomy and in severe anemia.
Pappenheimer bodies
Siderocytes are RBCs with Pappenheimer bodies, 
which are siderotic purple round granules
containing iron found at the periphery of red
cells. They show blue-green iron granules on

( 12 ) Hematology 
iron staining with Prussian blue. They are found 
in sideroblastic anemia, thalassemia, etc. 
Cabot ring 
These are pale-staining nuclear remnants in the 
form of rings or figure of eight seen in hemolytic 
anemia, megaloblastic anemia, leukemias, post­
splenectomy. 
Heinz bodies 
These are single inclusions containing residues 
of denatured Hb and stain only with supravital 
stains (e.g. cresyl violet). They are found in 
unstable Hb disease, G6PD deficiency, drug­
induced hemolytic anemia, etc. 
HbH inclusion bodies 
These are found in alpha thalassemia 
demonstrated by the reticulocyte supravital 
staining. 
Parasites 
They may be present in the RBC (Malaria), WBC 
(leishmania) or outside the cells (filaria). 
Nucleated Red Cells 
(Normoblasts/ erythroblasts) 
These are present in the blood in: 
1.Normal cord blood
2.Severe anemias (except aplastic anemia)
3.Hemolytic disease of newborn
4.Thalassemia major
5.Sickle cell disease
6.Leukemia
7.Myeloproliferative diseases
8.Post-splenectomy
Anemia refers to a decrease in hemoglobin
and the total number of red blood cells as
compared to the normal for that age and sex.
Symptoms of anemia are pallor, weakness,
fatigue, dysnea on exertion, headaches, angina,
pica and menorrhagia, depending on the speed
of onset, age and severity. Older patients may
have tachycardia and sometimes congestive heart
failure.

Iron deficiency anemia is the commonest cause of 
anemia. It is a microcytic hypochromic anemia. 
Stages 
1. 
2. 
3. Negative Iron Balance: Demand of iron increases 
above the ability to absorb iron. Hemoglobin, 
serum iron and TIBC are normal. serum ferritin 
is reduced. 
Iron Deficiency Erythropoiesis: Iron stores are 
depleted. Hemoglobin is normal, serum iron 
is reduced, TIBC is increased, serum ferritin is 
reduced and protoporphyrin is increased. 
Iron Deficiency Anemia: Hemoglobin also 
decreases (see Tables 12.3 and 12.4).

•Rapid replenishment of iron needed
•Ongoing blood needed
Impaired iron absorption
Preparations: 
For I.M. (stretch skin, insert needle deep IM, release 
skin and then inject to prevent discoloration of 
skin): 
•Iron dextran (Imferon)
•Iron Sorbitol citrate (Jectofer)

Blood transfusion: 
Transfusion of packed red cells can be given if 
there is excessive blood loss, congestive cardiac 
failure or immediate replenishment is required. 
Diuretics and antihistamines may be given 
simultaneously to prevent fluid overload and 
allergic reactions. Hemoglobin starts rising in 
three days.

Laboratory Diagnosis 
1.Blood: Hemoglobin decreased, macrocytosis,
anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, ovalocytosis, low
reticulocyte count, TLC and platelet count
may be reduced. Occasional hypersegmented
neutrophils present.
Arneth Count: The number of neutrophils with
more than 5 lobes are counted. In megaloblastic
anemia they are >5% (Normal <l %)
MCV inreased, MCH increased, MCHC normal
or reduced.
2.Bone Marrow Picture
a.Cellularity: Hypercellular, decreased M:E
ratio.
b. Erythropoiesis: Erythroid hyperplasia,
megaloblasts with fenestrated chromatin
network (nuclear maturation lags behind),
nucleated RBC precursors, HJ bodies.
c Giant metamyelocytes may be present.
d.Megakaryocytes: Normal
e.Iron staining shows increased number of
iron granules but no ring sideroblasts.
3.Biochemistry
A)Serum Vitamin B12 and Po/ate Levels
a)Serum vitamin B12 is reduced in
vitamin B 12 deficiency(Normal range
160-925 ng/1, less than 100 ng/1 is
indicative)
b) Serum folate is reduced in folate
deficiency (Normal range 6.0-20.0 ng/ 
ml, less than 4.0 ng/ml is significant).
c)Red cell folate is reduced in folate
deficiency (Normal range 160-640
mg/I). It may be normal or low in
vitamin B 12 deficiency.
d)Serum bilirubin (unconjugated)
521 

4. and serum LDH increased due to 
ineffective erythropo iesis 
e)Serummethylmalo nicacidandserum
homocysteine levels are both raised
in vitamin B12 deficiency and serum
homocysteine level is raised in folate
deficiency
f)Urinary formiminoglutamate
(FIGLU) levels increased
Schilling Test 
Absorption test which indirectly measures 
urinary exretion of B12 and detects intrinsic 
factor deficiency (pernicious anemia). 
1.Patient is given radiolabelled B 12 orally and
one hour later unlabelled B12 is given IV
( to saturate the tissue sites). If patient has
normal intrinsic factor, then B12 will be
absorbed and excreted in the urine. 24 hour
urine exretion is normally 10% or more.
In pernicious anemia or malabsorption
syndrome, urinary excretion is< 10%.
2.The patient is then given B12 bound to
intrinsic factor orally. The urinary excretion
is measured. If it returns to normal, patient
has pernicious anemia. Ifit remains< 10%,
patient has malabsorption syndrome
(bacterial overgrowth or ileal disease).
5.Microbiological Assay
Sample to be assayed is added to a medium with
all growth factors for a B 12 dependant organism,
Euglena gracilis. The growth of the organism is
compared to a standard.
Lactobacillus sp., which requires 5 methy
tetrahydrofolate (folic acid coenzyme), is used
for folate deficiency testing.
Treatment 
1. 
2. 
522 Treatment of B12 deficiency 
a)Diet: Non-vegetarian food, dairy products
b)Replacement therapy: 1000 µg B12 I.M,
once a week for 8 weeks-> 1000 µg B12
I.M, once a month for life.
Treatment of Folic Acid deficiency 
a)Diet: Green leafy vegetables, nuts, meat,
liver3. 
4. PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
b)Replacement therapy: 5 mg/day for 2-4
months
c)Folinic acid 100-200 mg/day used in
patients on treatment with methotrexate
or trimethoprim.
Treatment of Cause 
e.g. folic acid 5-10 mg/day in pregnancy,
antibiotics for blind loop syndrome, niclosamide
500 mg 3 tablets stat for D latum.
Packed cell transfusion
Given in cases of severe anemia. (Whole blood
transfusion causes circulatory overload)
Prognosis 
Symptoms of anemia disappear in 2-3 days. Reticulo­
cyte count increases by 4th day and peaks on 7th day. 
Peripheral neuropathy may improve in a few weeks. 
Neuronal damage does not improve. 
Pernicious Anemia 
Most common cause of Vitamin B12 deficiency is due 
to the absence of intrinsic factor (IF), due to atrophy of 
gastric mucosa or autoimmune destruction of parietal 
cells which produce the IF. Only B12 bound to IF is 
absorbed by terminal ileum. 
It is more common above 60 yrs age and in children 
< 10 yrs (juvenile pernicious anemia) 
It is associated with Graves disease, myxedema, 
Hashimoto's thyroiditis, vitilligo and has a higher 
incidence in relatives. 
Clinical features are of B12 deficiency with increased 
incidence of gastric polyps and gastric cancer. 
Diagnosis by anti-parietal antibody test (90%) and 
anti-intrinsic factor antibody test (60%). The latter 
is more specific. 
Treatment is lifelong Vitamin B 12 replacement therapy. 
Glucocorticoids may be helpful. 
15 > Differential Leucocyte 
Count 
A good peripheral blood smear is important to perform 
the differential leucocyte ( white cell) count (DLC) and 
to study the morphology of normal and abnormal 

< 12 > Hematology 
leucocytes. It should be done under oil immersion after 
first scanning the smear under low or high power to 
detect the area where the cells are separated and can 
be seen with good details. 
The different types of white cells present in the blood 
are counted and each type of cells counted (usually 
100). Absolute counts can be calculated by multiplying 
by the total white cell count. 
1.Neutrophils: Nucleus is divided into
2-5 lobes. Granules in the cytoplasm stain violet­
pink with Romanowsky stains. Cell size 10-12 µ.
Arneth Count is the number of cells per 100 
WBCs with more than 5 lobes in the nucleus 
(hypersegmented neutrophil). Normal Arneth 
count < 1 %. In megaloblastic anemia it is > 3%. 
Sex chromatin consists of a drumstick appendage 
( 1.2-1.5 µ) attached to one of the nuclear lobes 
by a thin strand. Present in males <0.3% and 
females 3-6% of neutrophils. 
2.Eosinophils: Nucleus has usually 2 lobes in a
spectacle arrangement and the cytoplasm has
large orange granules. Cell size 10-15 µ.
3.Basophils: The cell is slightly smaller than the
above two. The nucleus is kidney shaped or
lobulated and the cytoplasm has large, round,
deep purple to black granules.
4.Monocytes: This is the largest cell, twice the size
of a neutrophil. The nucleus is kidney shaped,
stains pale violet and has a fine chromatin
arrangement. The cytoplasm stains pale grayish
blue and may contain vacuoles and fine pinkish
blue granules. Cell size 14-20 µ.
5.Lymphocytes: These may be large (12-16 µ)
or small (8-10 µ). Large lymphocytes have an
indented nucleus with dense smudgy chromatin
and abundant, pale blue cytoplasm. The small
lymphocyte's nucleus is slightly indented & has
no visible chromatin pattern. The cytoplasm is
a scanty rim around the nucleus.

Multiple myeloma is a malignant proliferation of 
plasma cells characterised by increased plasma cells 
(> 15%) in the bone marrow, osteolytic bone lesions 
and the presence of paraproteins ( monoclonal protein 
or M-protein) in the serum and/or urine.

19 > Coagulation Studies 
The normal hemostatic response to blood vessel dam-

< 12 > Hematolog y 
age depends on closely linked interactions between the 
blood vessel wall, circulating platelets and blood co­
agulation factors (Figs. 12.9 and 12.10 and Table 12.7). 
The fibrinolytic system and inhibitors of coagulation 
limit the coagulation to the site of injury (Table 12.8). 
Defective hemostatic plug formation with spontaneous 
hemorrhage or abnormal bleeding following trauma 
or surgery may result from: 
1.Thrombocytopenia
2.Platelet dysfunction
3.A deficiency or defect of coagulation factors
4.The presence of inhibitors (in the blood) to the
action of coagulation factors.
5.Excessive fibrinolysis.
6.A combination of some of the above defects.

Laboratory Diagnosis 
Screening Tests 
These should be undertaken only after a full clinical 
assessment including family history. The results of 
these screening tests provide a presumptive diagnosis 
which can be confirmed with further tests. (Fig 12.11 
and Table 12.10). 
The tests and the normal ranges are given in Table 
12.9. 
Blood Collection 
Blood collection is very critical as the test results are 
affected by many variables. Venous blood should be 
collected using a clean venepuncture in 3.8% sodium 
citrate. The ratio of plasma to anticoagulant is critical. 
PCV correction for severe anemia or polycythemia is

essential and adequate anticoagulant should be added 
as per standard charts. History of warfarin, heparin, 
aspirin, etc. is essential. 
Platelet Count 
Accurate platelet counts are important for diagnosis of 
bleeding disorders(Refer Pg. 513). Direct peripheral 
smear examination is essential in patients with low 
counts to exclude pseudo-thrombocytopenia and to 
observe large platelets as in Bernard Soulier syndrome. 
Bleeding Time (BT) 
This test detects abnormal platelet function in vivo. 
It measures the time taken for a standardized skin 
wound to stop bleeding. Duke's, Ivy's, Template 
methods are used. 
Duke's Method is not very accurate. It uses a finger 
prick method (Refer Pg. 501). A 5 mm deep puncture 
is made and the bleeding time is recorded as in steps 
3 and 4 below. 
Ivy's Method 
1.A sphygmomanometer cuff is inflated over the
patients' arm and maintained at 40 mm Hg
throughout the test.
2.The volar surface of the foreman, devoid of
528 3. PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
superficial veins, is cleaned with 70% ethanol and 
allowed to dry. It is stretched and punctured up 
to 3 mm depth with a sterilised standard lancet. 
Every 30 seconds, the blood adjacent to the 
wound is gently blotted with a filter paper until 
bleeding stops. 
4.Bleeding time is recorded.
Note: 
1.BT is falsely prolonged in patients with history
of aspirin injestion within a week prior to the
test.
2.In hemophilia A and B, delayed bleeding from
the puncture site may be observed after 24 hours,
even though bleeding time is normal.
Template Method is the same as above, but uses a 
template made of plastic with a 9 mm slit. The blade 
is introduced into the slit and an incision 1 mm deep 
is made. 
Causes of Prolonged Bleeding time 
1. Thrombocytopenia (Platelet count< 50 xl09/L
prolongs bleeding time)
2. 
3. Platelet Function Disorders
a.Hereditary (von Willebrand's disease,
Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, Bernard
Soulier syndrome)
b.Acquired:
i)Drugs ( aspirin, N SAi D s,
anticoagul ants, tricyclic
antidepressants, high dose beta­
lactams, phenothiazines, anesthetics,
etc.)
ii)Uremia
iii)DIC, liver disease
iv)Malignancy
v)Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia
Dysfibrinogenemia, afibrinogenemia 
4.Vascular disorders
Capillary Fragility Test 
(Tourniquet Test/H ESS"s Test) 
This test indicates the degree of permeability of the 
capillary walls and any defect in them. 

< 12 > Hematology 
Method 
1.A sphygmomanometer cuff is applied around
the upper arm and inflated to pressure midway
between systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
2.After 7 mins, if more than 20 purpuric spots
(petechiae) apppear in an area of 3 ems in
diameter, below the antecubital fossa, the test
is positive.
Causes of Positive Capillary Fragility Test 
Thrombocytopenia, platelet function disorders, vas­
cular disorders, Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, scurvy. 
Whole Blood Clotting Time (CT) 
This is the time taken for whole blood drawn from 
a vein to clot in vitro. The surface of the glass tube 
initiates the clotting process. This test is sensitive to 
the factors involved in the intrinsic pathway. 
Clotting time is prolonged in: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
5. Deficiency of factor VIII, IX, XI or XII 
Afibrinogenemia, dysfibrinogenemia, 
hypofibrinogenemia 
Vitamin K deficiency 
Deficiency of factor II, V or X, von Willebrand's 
disease may prolong clotting time. 
Liver disease, warfarin therapy. 
Note: 
It is an insensitive method for screening abnormalities 
of coagulation as it is normal in nearly one-third of 
hemophilia patients. However, besides serving as a 
control over blood collection techniques, observation 
of the clot in these tubes after one hour and 24 hours 
gives insight into the platelet number and function 
and accelerated fibrinolysis respectively. 
Lee and White Method 
1. 
2. 
3. 1 ml of freshly collected is transferred directly 
from the syringe (without the needle) into two 
glass clotting tubes. 
After 2 minutes the tubes are examined every 
15 secs. by very gently tilting them. 
Clotting time is noted when the tube can be 
completely inverted without fluid loss. 4.Clot retraction and clot size are also observed
after one hour and 24 hours.
Prothrombin Time (PT) 
This is the time taken for platelet-poor citrated 
plasma to clot after adding calcium and tissue (brain) 
thromboplastin. This is an important screening test 
for defects of the extrinsic and common coagulation 
pathways since the intrinsic pathway is bypassed by 
adding tissue factors and calcium. 
PT is used to monitor oral anticoagulant therapy. 
I Normal PT is 10-14 secs. 
Prothrombin time is prolonged in: 
1.Congenital deficiencies of one or more of factors
II, V, VII or X
2.Therapy with coumarin or inadanedione (anti
coagulant) drugs.
3.Obstructive jaundice
4.Hemorrhagic disease of the newborn.
5.Liver disease
6.Fibrinogen deficiency
7.Vitamin K deficiency
Method 
1.0.1 ml brain extract is mixed with 0.1 ml plasma
in a glass test-tube placed in a water bath at 3 7°C.
2.After 1 min. 0.1 ml of warm 0.1 M CaCl2 is
added to the above mixture and the stop watch
is simultaneously started.
3.The end point is obtained by tilting the tube in
a regular consistent manner and stopping the
stopwatch the moment a clot appears.
4.The test must be performed in duplicates with
test and control plasmas and the average values
noted.
Partial Thromblastin Time 
PTT/APTT 
(Kaolin Cephalin Clotting Time). 
Platelet poor citrated plasma is preincubated with a 
surface activating agent (e.g. ellagic acid, particulate 
silicates or kaolin) and phospholipid prior to adding 
calcium. This test is used to detect defects of coagula-
529 

tion in the intrinsic and common pathways. PTT is 
used to monitor heparin therapy. 
It is known as partial PTT because platelet substitutes 
( which are partial thromboplastins), are used. They are 
not capable of activating the extrinsic pathway which 
requires complete tissue thromboplastin ( tissue factor). 
I Normal PTT is 30-40 secs. I 
PTT is prolonged in: 
1.Hemophilia A (Factor VIII: C deficiency)
2.Christmas disease (Hemophilia B) (Factor IX
deficiency)
3.Von Willebrand's disease (Factor VIII: vWF
deficiency)
4.Contact factor (XII) or factor XI deficiency
5.Heparin and oral anticoagulant therapy
6.Hepatic failure
7.Intravascular coagulation
8.Deficiencies in Factors II, V or X
9.Presence of acquired inhibitors e.g. in SLE
Method
1.Equal volumes of cephalin and kaolin are mixed.
0.1 ml of the mixture is added to 0.1 ml plasma
and incubated at 3 7°C in a water bath for 5 mins.
2.0.1 ml warm 0.025 M CaCl2 solution is added
and a second stopwatch started.
3.Clotting time is noted as for PT.
4.Duplicat e test and control samples are
simultaneously run and the values averaged and
compared.PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
Mixing Tests 
Prolonged clotting times in PT and PTT tests due 
to factors deficiency are corrected by the addition of 
normal plasma to the test plasma (mixing tests). If 
there is no partial correction, an inhibitor of coagula­
tion is suspected. 
Thrombin Time (TT} 
In this test, thrombin is added to citrated plasma and 
the clotting time noted. This tests the conversion of 
fibrinogen to fibrin monomers by thrombin. 
Prolonged TT is obtained in: 
1.Hypofibrinogenemia.
2.Dysfibrinogenemia.
3.Heparin, fibrinogen or fibrin degradation
products.
4.Chronic liver disease.
5.Multiple myeloma.
6.Intravascular coagulation.
Method
1.0.1 mldilutedthrombin isaddedtoO.l ml plasma
diluted with 0.1 ml buffered saline at 37°C in a
water bath. The clotting time is recorded.
2.Duplicate test and control samples should be
tested simultaneously. The normal pool sample
should give a clotting time of 15 -20 secs.
Clot Solubility in Urea 
Factor XIII cross links overlapping fibrin strands and 
make them resistant to solubilisation. 
In this test, urea or monochloroacetic acid are added 
to the clot (plasma clotted with CaClJ If Factor XIII 
deficiency ( < l % ) is present, the clot will be soluble.

1 > Urine Examination ----
Collection of Urine 
1.Random freshly voided sample is usually
adequate for most tests. Early morning sample
is usually preferred because not only is it most
concentrated but also because it has a low pH,
which preserves the formed elements.
2.A 24-hour sample is usually required for
quantitative tests. The early morning urine is
discarded and all the urine during the next 24
hours including the early morning urine the next
day is collected.
3.A mid-stream sample is required for
bacteriological tests. Before voiding, the patients
must clean the glans penis or vulva properly.
The initial urine is discarded and a clean-catch
mid-stream sample is collected.
Preservation of urine 
No preservative is required if urine is examined in 1-2 
hours after voiding. Preservatives are required for 24 
hours collection. 
1.Toluene is the best preservative but it interferes
with protein estimation by sulfosalicylic acid
method.
2.Thymol, Formalin or Chloroform: 1 drop/30 ml.
preserves sediments but interferes with sugar
and acetone estimation.
3.Concentrated HCI (10 ml) is useful for all
chemical examination especially calcium and
nitrogen content.
Physical Examination 
A.Quantity: Average urine output is 1,200-2,000
ml/day. Polyuria is increased urine output.Oliguria is decreased (less than 500 ml/ day) urine 
output. Anuria is total suppression of urine (less 
than 50 ml/24 hr). 
B.Color: Normal urine color is clear, pale yellow
due to the presence of urobilin and urochromes.
The depth of the color depends on the volume
of urine voided and specific gravity of urine.
Presence of blood, bile, lymph and drugs alter
the color of urine. Cloudy urine may occur due
to presence of amorphous phosphates and urates,
pus, bacteria, fungi and chyle.
C.Odor: Normal fresh urine has a slight aromatic
odor. When allowed to stand, urea is decomposed
to form ammonia, giving a strong ammoniac
smell. Ketone bodies, when present, may give a
fruity odor.
D.Reaction: Normal urine is acidic in reaction
with pH 6.0 due to the presence of weak organic
acids. On standing, it becomes alkaline due to
formation of ammonia.
Method: Blue and red litmus papers are put in
urine. If blue turns red, urine is acidic. If red
turns blue, urine is alkaline. pH paper has a
range from 4.5-7.0.
E.Specific gravity: Normal specific gravity of
urine varies from 1.003-1.030 and it can vary
between 1.001-1.060. Substances influencing
specific gravity are urea, sodium, chloride and
phosphates. Albumin and sugar, when present,
may also alter specific gravity. In end stage
renal disease when the kidneys lose their ability
to concentrate urine, the specific gravity may
remain fixed at 1.010.
Method 
1.Urine is poured into a cylinder or conical flask
till it is three-fourths full.

4. Urinometer, which is a weighed cylinder with a 
scale in the stem reading from 1.001 to 1.060, is 
floated in the urine freely, without touching the 
bottom or sides (Fig. 13.1) 
Reading is taken at eye level. 
A refractometer can also be used. 
Correction 
1.For temperature: Urinometer is usually calibrated
for a certain temperature, which is marked on it 
(usually 15° or 20°C). For each 3°C above this, 
0.001 is added to the reading. For each 3°C below 
this, 0.001 is subtracted from the reading. 
2.For albumin: For every 1 mg% albumin in urine
0.001 is deducted from the reading.
Chemical Examination 
I. 
534 Proteins: 
Normal 24-hour urine sample contains less 
than 50 mg of proteins, which is not detected by 
conventional tests described below. If proteins 
are detected by these tests it is abnormal and 
denotes proteinuria. 
Method 
A.Heat test:
1.If the urine is alkaline, it is made acidic
by addition of 3% acetic acid.2.If the urine is turbid it should be
filtered.
3.Filtered urine is taken in a test-tube
and the upper part of the column
boiled.* A white cloud appears if
proteins, phosphates or carbonates
are present.
4.2-3 drops of 3% acetic acid is added.
If the white cloud persists it is due to
proteins.
5.3 drops of nitric acid is added. If the
precipitate disappears it is due to
nucleoproteins and mucin, whereas
if it persists it is due to albumin or
globulin.
*Upper part of the column must be heated and
not the lower part for 2 reasons:
1.By convection currents hot liquid moves up and
so if the lower part is heated it takes longer for
proteins to precipitate than if only the upper
part is heated.
2.If only the upper part is heated, the convection
current does not affect the lower part which
remains cold and unchanged and acts as a control
to compare with the cloudiness in the upper part.
It is important to note that false negative results may 
be obtained: 
a)If urine is alkaline, because proteins may

< 13 ) Clinical Pathology 
be converted to non-coagulable alkaline 
metaproteins on boiling. 
b)If excess of acetic acid is added before
boiling, because proteins may be converted
to acid metaproteins which are also
noncoagulable on boiling.
B.Sulfosalicylic acid test:
1.2 ml of clear urine is taken and 3%
sulfosalicylic acid is added.
2.Mixture is allowed to stand for 10
minutes.
3.Presence of proteins (as little as 5
mg) is indicated by cloudiness and
precipitation.
C.Heller's test
1.Urine is added drop by drop to 1 ml.
of concentrated nitric acid in a test
tube.
2.Presence of proteins is indicated by
the appearance of a white ring at the
junction of acid and urine.
D.Albustix, Clinistix or Labstix: Urine
is passed on these sticks and change
of color indicates the presence
of albumin. All these tests are based
on the same principle. An indicator, tetra
bromphenol blue, which has a yellow color
at pH 3, changes to blue or green at the
same pH in presence of proteins.
E.Esbach's quantitative method:
1.Specific gravity of urine is noted. If it
is more than 1.008 it is diluted till it
is less than 1.008.
2.Filtered, acidified urine of correct
specific gravity is taken in Esbach's
albuminimeter up to mark "U"
3.Esbach's reagent (which consists of 1
gm picric acid to precipitate proteins,
2 gm citric acid to dissolve phosphates
and 100 ml water) is added to mark
"R'' and mixed.
4.The tube is corked and stood vertically
for 24 hours when proteins settle
down and the precipitate read off
in gm/liter. If the urine was diluted.the figure must be multiplied by the 
dilution factor. If this is multiplied 
by total 24-hour urine volume in 
liters, it gives 24-hour excretion. If it 
is multiplied by 10, it gives gm% of 
proteins present. 
F.Kingsbury test: This is rapid and more
accurate than Esbach's test.
II.Sugar
A.1.2.Srnlofurine istakenina test-tubeand
7.5 ml of 3% sulfosalicylic acid is
added.
2.The two solutions are mixed and
allowed to stand for 5 minutes.
3.The turbidity is compared with
the standards in a colorimeter and
expressed as gm%.
Benedict's qualitative test: 
1.To 5 ml. of Benedict's qualitative
reagent, 0.5 ml of protein free urine
is added (8 drops). (Proteins interfere
with precipitation of cuprous oxide).
Measured amounts of Benedict's
reagent and urine are taken, as this
test is a semiquantitative test.
2.The mixture is boiled and a change
of color, if any, from blue to green,
yellow, orange or red and presence
of precipitate is noted.
3.The results are noted as follows:
Negative: No change of color 
Trace: solution pale green and slightly cloudy 
+ : Cloudy green
++ :Yellow (less than 1%)
+++: Orange (1-2%)
++++: Brick red (more than 2%)
This test is based on the principle that 
sugars reduced blue copper sulfate in 
alkaline solution to insoluble yellow 
cuprous oxide. 
False positive results occur in presence 
of 
a)Lactose, fructose or pentose.
b) Salicylates (This also gives +ve

535 

536 B.Clinistix (test tape): Glucose oxidase,
peroxidase and orthotoluidine are
incorporated into a cellulose strip along
with a chromogen system. The strip is
dipped for half a minute in the urine.
Glucose is oxidised in the presence of
glucose oxidase to gluconic acid and
hydrogen peroxide which is liberated
produces a blue color. The test is specific
for glucose (when more than 15 mg%) but
is more expensive than Benedict's test.
C.Tablet test:
I.5 drops ofurine and 10 drops of water
are placed in a test tube.
2.One Clinitest tablet is added and the
change of color is noted.
3.If the solution changes from orange
to brown color more than 2% sugar
is present.
4.If this change does not occur, the color
of the solution, 15-30 seconds after
the boiling stops, is compared with
the standard chart provided to note
the amount of sugar present.
This 
test has a self-heating tablet which
determines the presence of reducing
sugar by reduction of copper sulfate.
D.Benedict's quantitative test:
I.If the qualitative Benedict's test is
strongly positive, urine is diluted "X"
times.
2.25 ml of Benedict's quantitative
reagent is taken in a conical flask
and to it is added 15 gm of crystalline
sodium bicarbonate and some broken
porcelain. The mixture is boiled.
3.When sodium bicarbonate is
completely dissolved, urine is run
down from the burette slowly whilst
the mixture is boiling, till all blue color
is discharged.
4.The amount ofurine required is noted:

urine is:

X -dilution factor Y -Amount of urine. 
III.Ketone Bodies
Ketone bodies are intermediate products of fat
metabolism. Acetone, Diacetic acid and Beta
hydroxybutyric acid are the ketone bodies found
in urine when fat metabolism is deranged as in
diabetes mellitus and following starvation.
A. Rothera's test:
1. 
2. 5 ml. of urine is fully saturated with 
ammonium sulfate. 
1 crystal of sodium nitroprusside is 
added. 
3.Liquor ammonia is run down the side
of the tube.
4.If permanganate color develops at the
junction, acetone and/ or diacetic acid
are present.
B.Gerhardt's test:
1.5 ml. of urine is taken in a test-tube
and 10% ferric chloride solution is
added drop-by-drop until further
precipitate of ferric phosphate occurs.
2.The solution is filtered and to the
filtrate more ferric 
chloride solution
is added.
3.If a brownish red color develops,
diacetic acid or salicylate is present.
4.The above test is repeated on another
sample of 5 ml of urine to which 5
ml of water is added and the mixture
boiled till the volume is reduced to 5
ml.
5.If the test, which is positive with
unboiled urine, is negative with
boiled urine, it is due to diacetic
acid which on boiling is converted
to acetone which evaporates. If the
test is strongly positive both times it
is due to salicylates.

Microscopic Examination 
Preparation of Smear 
1.10-15 ml of urine is taken in a conical centrifuge
tube and centrifuged at 3,000 r.p.m. for 5 minutes
to bring all the sediments to the bottom.
2.After centrifuging, the supernatant fluid is
poured off and the fluid clinging to the sides of
the tube is allowed to run down and mix with
the centrifuged deposit.
3.This is then transferred to a glass slide and
examined at first under the low power and then
high power, preferably using a phase contrast
microscope.
Urinary sediments 
The various urinary sediments are: 
A.Organised: Crystals.
B.Unorganised: Casts, red cells, pus cells, epithelial
cells and bacteria.
Crystals Found in Acid Urine 
1.Uric acid and urates: Uric acid crystals are
538 2. 
3. PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
yellowish whereas urate crystals are reddish 
granules. 
Calcium oxalate: These are prism or dumbbell 
shaped crystals also found in alkaline or neutral 
urine. 
Cysteine: These are refractile hexagonal plates. 
4.Leucine and Tyrosine: These are spherical and
fine needle respectively.
Crystals Found in Alkaline Urine 
I.Phosphate: These are colorless, feathery or leaf­
like if due to triple phosphate. If due to dicakium
phosphate, they are colorless prisms arranged as
rosettes or stars.
2.Calcium carbonate and oxalate.
Casts 
Casts are formed in the renal tubules by coagulation 
of albuminous material. They are usually cylindrical 
in shape and associated with pathological lesions in 
the kidney. 
I.Hyaline: These are colorless, semitransparent
casts which consist of coagulated protein
material.
2.Granular: These are granular deposition on
coagulated proteins. Granules are due to
disintegration of white cells or epithelial cells of
the tubules. They always indicate renal disease.
3.Epithelial: These are coagulated proteins in which
are embedded epithelial cells from renal tubules.
4.Blood: These are red cells embedded in the
coagulated protein in the tubules. This is found
in acute glomerulonephritis.
5.Pus cells: These are pus cells embedded in the
coagulated protein. This is found in suppurative
conditions of the kidney.
6. 
7. 
Cells Fatty: These are fat globules embedded in the
coagulated protein. They are derived from
degenerating 
epithelial cells.
Waxy: These casts resemble hyaline casts, but
are more opaque with a dull waxy appearance.
They are seen in end stage kidney disease.
1.Red cells: When in large number is always
pathological.

( 13 ) Clinical Pathology
2. 
3. Pus cells: These denote urinary infection or 
contamination with vaginal secretions. 
Epithelial cells: When these are present in large 
numbers they denote destruction of the tissue 
in the urinary tract. 
2 > S utum 
I.Naked Eye Examination:
A.Quantity: This varies from a few ml in the
early morning sample to a liter in 24 hours.
Large quantities are seen in lung abscess,
bronchiectasis and tuberculosis.
B.Odor: It is usually inoffensive. It is offensive
in bronchiectasis, lung abscess and
gangrene of the lung.
C.Consistency: It may be serous, purulent,
blood streaked, hemorrhagic or viscid,
depending on the underlying disorder.
II.Microscopic Examination:
Normally there may be epithelial cells, leucocytes,
fibrinous strands and bacteria.
Abnormal contents include large number of
epithelial cells, pus cells, elastic fibres, malignant
cells, Curschmann's spirals, Charcot Leyden
crystals, fibrinous casts and parasites.
III.Concentration Method:
Petroff 's Method: Treat a specimen of sputum
with an equal volume of 4% sodium hydroxide.
Keep at 37°C for 30 minutes until the mixture
is homogenous. Neutralize the mixture with
8% hydrochloric acid and centrifuge. Take the
deposit from the centrifuged sample and make
a smear.
Gram's Stain
This is done to visualize gram positive and gram
negative bacteria.
1.Make a smear of the sputum and fix it by
heating over a flame.
2.Pour gentian violet over it for 3 minutes to
stain.
3.Pour Gram's Iodine over this for 1 minute
for mordanting action.4.Drain off, washanddecolorizewithalcohol.
5.Wash with water.
6.Pour safranin for 30 seconds for
counterstaining.
7.Wash and dry the slide.
8.Mount under oil immersion.
Ziehl Neelsen's Stain 
This is done to visualize acid-fast bacteria e.g. 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium 
leprae. 
1.Make a smear of the sputum and fix it by
heating over a flame.
2.Pour carbol fuchsin over the smear and
heat it from below (till fumes rise) for 5

3 > Feces Examination -----
Collection of Sample: The sample of feces is prefer­
ably collected in a disposable cardboard container. 
Examination should not be delayed for more than a few 
hours especially when amoebae are to be looked for. 
Naked Eye Examination 
A.Quantity: Bacteria normally make up one third
to one half of the dry weight of feces. Bulkier
stools occur with vegetarian diet.
B.Color: Normal feces are light to dark brown in
color due to the presence of bile pigments. Clay
colored stools occur in obstructive jaundice due
to absence of bile pigments in the stools. Tarry
or black stools occur in upper gastro-intestinal
hemorrhage due to altered blood. Tarry stools
also occur following iron administration.
C.Consistency: Normal stools are well formed.
539 

Watery stools occur in diarrhea. Hard feces 
suggest constipation. Flattened and rib-bon-like 
stools occur in obstruction in the lumen of the 
bowels. Pale, bulky, semi-solid, frothy stools, 
occur in malabsorption syndrome. 
D.Odor: Normal odor offeces is due to the presence
of indole and skatole, which is stronger after a
meat diet. In nursing infants, a typical sour odor
due to the presence of fatty acids occurs.
E.Blood and Mucus: Small amounts of mucus
may be normally present. When large amounts
of mucus are present, especially with blood, it
suggests lesions of the large gut especially amebic
or bacillary dysentery. Rarely it may be due to
uremia or cancer.
F. Parasites: Stools may contain worms or segments
of worms e.g. roundworm, tapeworm, etc.

A.Saline preparation: A bit of fecal matter is taken
on the end of narrow stick and a thin emulsion
in a drop of saline is prepared on the slide. A
coverslip is put and the smear is examined to
detect the motility of E. histolytica and other
organisms.

of saline, Gram's iodine is used. Iodine stains 
nuclear structures making identification simpler. 
However, this preparation kills the organisms 
and hence motility cannot be detected. 
C.Hanging-drop preparation: A bit of diluted fecal
material is taken on a coverslip, which is inverted
on a special slide and then examined under the
microscope. This helps to examine the darting
motility of Vibrio cholera.
D.Concentration method:
1.1 ml of feces is taken in a flat-bottomed

Eggs of the round worm matures in the soil and infects 
green vegetables. Man eats the eggs containing larvae. 
Larvae bore through the intestinal mucosa and through 
the portal circulation reach the heart and lungs. They 
re-enter into the stomach by breaking the alveoli and 
going up the trachea, pharynx and oesophagus. In the 
intestines the larvae mature into adult worms. After 
fertilization, the gravid female lays eggs which pass 
out through the feces and enter the soil. 
Clinical Features 
The clinical features are divided into two groups: 
1.Those due to migrating larvae.

Migrating Larvae in the lungs are responsible for 
cough and fever. If the infection is severe there may 
be dyspnea, urticaria and eosinophilia. 
If the migrating larvae enter the general circulation 
through the pulmonary capillaries, they may lodge in 
various organs like brain, heart, kidneys, etc. causing 
disease of that organ. 
The Adult Worms are present in the upper part of 
the small intestine and hence cause gastro-intestinal 
symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, loss of 
weight and dull aching pain in abdomen. Mechanical 
effects like intussusception or intestinal obstructions 
may occur. Allergic manifestations like urticaria, cough 
& conjunctivitis and signs of hypoproteinemia and 
vitamin deficiency may also be present. 
Rare symptoms are appendicitis, obstructive jaundice 
and respiratory suffocation due to the passage of worms 
from the esophagus to the pharynx. 
Diagnosis 
1.Adult worm may be present in stools or in the
vomitus. Stools may also show the eggs.
2. 
3. Hemogram may show anemia and eosinophilia.
Adult worm may be seen

in color. It is spindle shaped and resembles a piece 
of thread. The egg is flat on one side and convex on 
the other. 
Life-cycle 
The adult threadworms mature in the cecum in 2-3 
weeks. The gravid female travels down and lays eggs 
around the anus. During scratching of the anal region, 
the fingers get contaminated. The eggs containing 
larvae are swallowed and the latter are liberated into 
the cecum. 
Clinical Features 
Children are commonly affected. The symptoms are 
due to the female worm creeping out of the anus and 
laying eggs in the perianal region. This causes intense 
itching around the anal region especially at night. In 
female patients genitals may be affected. Sometimes 
appendicitis may occur. 
Diagnosis 
Inspection of the anal region at the time of perianal 
itching may reveal the gravid female. Stool examination 
may show the presence of eggs or adult worms.

Hookworm 
(Ancylostoma duodenale) 
Morphology 
The adult worm is small, grayish white and 
cylindrical in form. The egg is oval in shape 
and contains four blastomeres. 
Life-cycle 
The eggs develop in the soil into larvae, 
which infects man through the skin of the 
bare foot. It enters the blood stream and 
reaches the lungs. Larvae break through 
lung capillaries and travel up the respiratory 
tract to reach pharynx. They are swallowed Larvae penetrate 
the skm and

larvae 
back into the stomach and mature as adult worms in 
the intestines in about 3-4 weeks. They attach to the 
intestinal walls and suck blood. After fertilization, 
gravid female discharges eggs, which are passed in 
the feces and then into the soil. 
Clinical Features 
1.The patient often presents with anemia. The
parasites remain attached to the intestinal
mucosa by means of powerful buccal armatures,
through which it continuously sucks blood and
causes chronic hypo chromic microcytic anemia.
2.The larvae at the site of entry through the
human skin may produce dermatitis or ground
itch.
3.In the lungs, bronchitis andbroncho-pneumonia
may occur due to the migrating larvae.
Diagnosis

After fertilization, the gravid female liber­
ates eggs which are passed in the feces. In 
the soil, eggs develop and are swallowed 
by man. They develop into larvae in the 
intestines and reach the cecum. 
Clinical Features 
There are usually no symptoms. In heavy 
infections abdominal pain and diarrhea 
may be present. 
Diagnosis 
Examination of the stool shows charac­
teristic barrel shaped eggs. 
Treatment 
Stilbazium iodide, thiabendazole and 
mebendazole. 
Tapeworm 
(Taenia Saginata and Taenia Solium) 
Morphology 
Adult Worm: Taenia saginata is white and 
semitransparent, measuring 5-8 meters 
in length. Taenia solium measures about 
2-4 meters in length.
Eggs: The eggs are spherical having outer 
thin transparent wall and inner embryo­
phore, thick walled and radially striated. 
Life Cycle 
The life cycle is same in T. solium and 
T.saginata, excepting the intermediate
host which in T. saginata is cow and in
T.solium is pig.
The adult worms fertilize in the small 
intestines of man. Gravid female liberates 
eggs, which are passed in the feces. The 
eggs are swallowed by the intermediate 
host ( cow for T saginata and pig for T 
It measures 3-5 cm in length. The egg is barrel shaped 
with a mucus plug at each end. 
Life-cycle solium) whilst grazing in the field. The eggs develop in 
the stomach and then reach the muscles as cysticercus. 
The meat of the intermediate host, when eaten by man 
causes liberation of these cysticerci in the stomach. 
The larvae develop into mature worms in the cecum. 
544 

( 13 ) Clinical Pathology 
Cysticerci reach the small intestines and mature into 
adult worms. 
Clinical Features 
Adult worms in the intestine usually produce the 
symptoms. The patient may notice segments of the 
tapeworm in feces. 
Cysticercus Cellulose 
The larval form of T. solium though occurs in pig, 
man may become infested either by drinking con­
taminated water or by eating uncooked vegetables 
infected with eggs. 
In the stomach the shells of the ova are digested and 
larvae are liberated. The larvae penetrate the intestinal 
mucosa and reach any part of the body. They are usu­
ally concentrated in the skin and muscles. They can be 
palpated as nodules. They may be found in the brain 
causing epileptic fits. The cysts die in about five years 
and become calcified. 
Treatment 
The effective drug is mepacrine. Other drugs used are 
dichlorophen and niclosamide. 
Hydatid Worm 
The dog tape worm (Echinococcus granulosa) 
Morphology 
The adult worm is 3.5 mm in length. The egg is oval 
in shape resembling the egg ofTaenia. 
Life-cycle 
The adult worm develops in the small intestines of 
dog (definitive host) and gravid female liberates eggs, 
which are passed in the feces. Handling of dog by man ( intermediate host) leads to ingestion of eggs. The eggs 
develop in the stomach and form hydatid cysts in liver, 
lung, brain, etc. Since human flesh is not ingested by 
dogs, the cycle may end. However, if the eggs develop 
in other intermediate hosts like sheep, cow, pig, etc., 
ingestion of their flesh by dogs causes liberation of 
eggs in the stomach of the dog. 
Clinical Features 
The larval stage ofhydatid cyst usually occurs in sheep 
and cattle. Dog, by ingesting cysts is the definitive host. 
Man is infested either by a direct contact with infested 
dog or by taking uncooked vegetable contaminated 
with infected canine feces. 
The infection is acquired in the childhood. 
The hydatid cyst grows very slowly. The most com­
monly affected organ is liver. The lungs and the brain 
are the other affected organs. 
The cyst usually remains symptomless. At the site, it 
may cause pressure symptoms. The cyst may rupture 
or suppurate. 
Diagnosis 
1. Blood examination shows eosinophilia.
2.Casoni's Intradermal test consists ofintradermal
injection of0.2 ml of sterile hydatid fluid. A large
wheal (5 ems) indicates positive test.
3.Radiology: X-rays oflungs and liver may reveal
cyst in the form of a circular shadow.
Treatment 
There is no specific treatment. The cyst, if causing 
pressure symptoms necessitates surgical removal. 
Mebendazole 600 mg TDS for 21 days has been found 
effective in hydatid cyst of the liver.

When observing any specimen one should 
observe the following: 
I.Size: Whether normal, small, enlarged, or only a
portion of the entire viscera has been preserved.
II.Shape: Whethernormalordistorted. If distorted,
whether they are normally found there or not.
Ill. Position: The relation of organs and surrounding 
tissues to each other. 
IV.Surface: Whether the surface is smooth or not.
Normally pericardium, pleurae and peritoneum
are smooth, shiny and transparent.
V.Capsule: Whether the organ or tissue has a capsule
or not and whether it is normal or thickened,
opaque and adherent.
VI.Cut section: If the organ has been cut one should
make a note of the following:
A.Whether it is cut longitudinally, transversely
or obliquely
B.The normal areas
C.The abnormal areas
D.Whether there are any contents and if
present whether they are normally found
there or not.
1 Central Nervous System 
1.Meningitis
Gross
There will be exudate over the base of the brain.
In tuberculous meningitis it is thick and may be
organized enmeshing the structures at the base.
There may be small tubercles extending on the
surfaces of the brain.In pyogenic meningitis the exudate may extend 
to cover the lateral surfaces of the brain and may 
be greenish, and less thick, than the tuberculous 
exudate. 
Microscopic 
In tuberculous meningitis there is predominantly 
mononuclear exudate in the meningeal space. 
There may be tubercle like lesions. 
In pyogenic meningitis there is a predominantly 
polymorphonuclear exudate in the meningeal 
space. 
II.Cerebral Abscess
Gross
There is an area of softening and congestion.
There may be evidence of cerebral edema like
flattening of gyri and obliteration of sulci.
The cut section shows an abscess-like area with
necrotic areas and pus formation.
Microscopic
There is an area of necrosis with an acute
inflammatory infiltration, predominantly
polymorphs and macrophages.

2 Cardiovas�ular System 
I.Pericarditis
Gross
The most commonly encountered specimen is
that of fibrinous pericarditis. The external surface
of the heart is covered with a fibrinous exudate,
which may have undergone organisation and
may form adhesions. When the layers of the
pericardium are pulled apart they are likened to
a bread and butter appearance, as they resemble
two slices of buttered bread being pulled apart.
Other exudates that may be seen are serous,
hemorrhagic or purulent if watery fluid, blood or
pus respectively is seen in the pericardia! cavity.
II.Rheumatic Heart Disease
Gross
The essential lesion in rheumatic endocarditis
is the presence of rheumatic nodules in the
r-,q 1 �.2 F,brinou·, f)Pr1c;1rd1t1·, 
-� . -F,g 1,13 Acuterhcurn.1t1ccnrloc11d1t"

endocardium of the valves. There is diffuse 
thickening of the cusps and there may be 
rheumatic vegetations. These are tiny, bead -
like, warty nodules arranged in a row along 
the margin of contact of the cusps i.e. on their 
proximal aspect. 
There may be associated pericarditis. There may 
be associated valvular stenosis, usually the mitral, 
often also the aortic. Calcification of the valves 
also may be seen. 
There may be a MacCallum patch i.e. a rough 
thickened whitish patch on the posterior wall 
of the left atrium just above the mitral valve. 
There may be thickening and shortening of the 
chordae tendineae. 
Microscopic 
There may be a pancarditis i.e. inflammation of 
all the layers. The vegetations consist of platelet 
thrombi-deposited on the raw surfaces of the 
endothelium, later becoming organized. 
Aschoff bodies may be seen in the myocardium, 
usually around the blood vessels. They consist of 
a central necrotic, reticulated area, lymphocytes, 
plasma cells and the characteristic, large 
multinucleated Aschoff cells. The Anitschkow 
cells with its serrated bar of chromatin in the 
centre of the nucleus ('caterpillar nucleus') may 
also be seen. Usually fibroblastic tissue and 
collagen fibers are seen in the later stages. 
III.Bacterial Infective Endocarditis
Gross
The lesions affect mainly the mitral and
sometimes the aortic valve.
547 

Fig 14 4 Subacute bacterial endocarditis 
The characteristic lesions are large, polypoid, 
brownish, friable vegetations which originate 
from the line of contact, but may cover the valve 
and spread to the mural endocardium. 
Microscopic 
The vegetations consist of amorphous masses 
consisting of fused platelets and fibrin. The 
valve is infiltrated by inflammatory cells, mostly 
mononuclear cells. Bacterial colony clumps may 
be seen at places. 
IV.Atherosclerosis of the Aorta
Definition
548 Atherosclerosis is a patchy and irregularly
disposed process usually involving the intima
oflarge elastic and muscular arteries.
Gross
Usually the abdominal aorta is affected because
Fig 14 Sand 14 6 Earlyancllateatheroscleros1s V. PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
there is a maximum trauma and eddying of the 
blood in that region. There may be yellow fatty 
dots and/or streaks, wax-like plaques, ulcers, 
calcification or hemorrhage depending on the 
stage reached. There may be narrowing and 
occlusion of branches arising from the main 
trunk. There may be thrombi overlying the 
lesions. 
Microscopic 
1.There is lipid accumulation in the
cytoplasm ofintimal smooth muscle fibers
transforming them into foamy lipophages.
2.Aggregates of lipophages disintegrate
leading to release of thin lipid content which
is degraded to cholesterol giving rise to the
typical slit like spaces of the cholesterol
crystals. A slight inflammatory exudate
may be seen around.
3.A sclerotic layer forms over the intimal
lipid accumulation.
4.There is vascularization from the arterial
wall beneath the plaque.
5.Calcification, hemorrhage and overlying
thrombosis may be seen.
Syphilis of the Aorta 
Gross 
The characteristic findings may be obscured by 
superimposed atherosclerosis. Very often both 
syphilis and atherosclerosis may occur in the 
aorta simultaneously. 
Usually the ascending aorta is involved, often 
associated with aortic valvular affection, the 
valve displaying thickened, rolled, foreshortened 
cusps and widened commissures. 
The aorta shows thickening of the aortic wall 
and longitudinally disposed linear depressions 
of the intima interspersed with elevated, gray­
white fibrotic plaques. There may also be radially 
disposed fissures. The appearance of the aorta 
has been described as a 'tree bark appearance'. 
Microscopic 
1here is both a periarteritis and an endarteritis 
with some atrophy of the media. The intima 
shows marked uniform thickening and 

( 14 > Pathology Specimens 
endarteritis obliterans. There is gumma 
formation with a mantle of lymphocytes and 
plasma cells especially around the lymphatic 
channels and vasa vasorum. 
VI.Aneurysms of the Aorta
Definition
An aneurysm is an abnormal roughly
circumscribed dilatation of an artery due to
structural weakening.
Gross
A true aneurysm ( where the sac is formed by
the wall of the vessel) must be differentiated
from a false one (where the sac is formed by the
surrounding tissues).
Usually fusiform ( elongated or spindle-shaped)
aneurysms are associated with atherosclerosis,
and saccular (rounded or sac-like) aneurysms
occur in syphilis. It may be eroding adjacent
structures eg the body of the vertebrae, or, may
have ruptured resulting in a tear surrounded by
blood clots or there may be lamellated blood
clots within the aneurysmal sac.
Dissecting aneurysms are not true aneurysms, as
the vessel is not dilated. Here hemorrhage occurs
in the media of the aorta between the middle
and outer thirds, commencing at the base and
spreading along the vessel for a variable distance
splitting the media into two layers in its passage.
F,g 14 7 Aneurysm of aorta 
- ---- -----3 
The lung is identified by the presence of pleura, hilium, 
bronchovascular structures and black pigmentation 
distributed throughout the parenchyma. 
I.Lobar Pneumonia
This is a progressive process beginning at the
hilum and proceeding to the periphery involving
one or more lobes or both lungs. (Usually one
lobe with a clear demarcation is seen). One or
more stages may be seen at a time.
Gross
A.Stage I: Acute congestion and edema
The region is grayish red with frothy blood
stained fluid exuded on squeezing.
B.Stage II: Red hepatization (2-4 days)
The cut surface is dry, granular, red, airless,
has the consistency of liver and retains
straight, sharp edges. Fibrinous pleurisy
maybe seen.
C.Stage III: Gray hepatization (4-8 days)
The cut surface is dry, granular, gray, airless,
has the consistency of liver and retains
straight, sharp edges. Fibrinous pleurisy
maybe seen.
D.Stage IV: Resolution
The cut surface is gray or brown with a
mottled look. Large amounts of frothy,
creamy fluid exude on pressure.
F,g 14.8 · Lobar pneumonia (gross) 
549 

Microscopic 
A.Acute congestion and edema:
Prominent alveolar capillaries with alveoli
filled with eosinophilic fluid and a few
neutrophils. Gram's stain may divulge the
organisms.
B.Red hepatization (2-4 days):
Replacement of alveolar fluid by marked
neutrophilic infiltration, few fibrin strands
and few erythrocytes.
C.Gray hepatization (4-8 days):
Mostly fibrin, fewer neutrophils, and
retraction of the exudate from the region
of the alveolar septae.
D.Resolution:
Shrunken fibrin masses with a large number
of macrophages engulfing the debris and
neutrophils.
II.Lung Abscess
Gross
550 A.Site: Abscesses of inhalational origin are
usually found in the right upper lobe or
the right lower lobe apex due to the more
vertical course of the right bronchus.
Abscesses following pneumonia may be
found anywhere, not necessarily in relation
to a bronchus as found above. Septicemic
abscesses are usually small and scattered
in both lungs.
B.Appearance: In early stages the abscess is
yellow or white, and firm. It may have a
thin red rim.
Once liquefaction occurs there is pus
formation with a ragged, yellow lining.
Chronic abscesses have firm, fibrosed walls
with a fairly smooth lining and surrounding
organizing pneumonia.
Microscopic 
Acute abscesses show destruction of the 
parenchyma with a dense polymorphonuclear 
infiltration andvaryingnumbersof macrophages. 
Chronic abscesses also show a surrounding 
fibrous zone. PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
Differential Diagnosis : The microscopic 
picture will prove the diagnosis, but on gross 
examination: 
A.Granulomas will be firm, show evidence of
chronicity, will not have a red rim or show 
liquefaction.
B.Necrosis in a tumor: Tumorous area may
be seen around, probably in relation
to a bronchus with evidence of tumor
infiltration into surrounding tissue. No
red rim is seen.
C. Tuberculosis in lung: There is caseation
necrosis as opposed to liquefaction necrosis
with pus formation. If lymph nodes are
kept along with the lung specimen there
will be caseation there too. Again this is a
smooth walled cavity as compared to acute
lung abscesses.
III.Tuberculosis of the Lung
This may show in a variety of forms of gross
morphology , most usually associated with
involvement of overlying pleura.
Gross
A.Miliary tuberculosis
The lungs are studded with firm white
tubercles about 1 mm in diameter which
may later appear as numerous caseating
tubercles slightly larger in size. The pleurae
may be thickened, opaque and adherent.
B.Chronic fibrocaseous tuberculosis
Usually first cavities are formed at the
apex. The cavity walls are smooth and
may be traversed by bronchi and blood

vessels. There is central cavitation and 
caseation (Cheesy material). Pleurae may 
be involved with thickening, adherence & 
opacity. Bronchioles may show softening 
and dilatation. 
C.Acute tuberculous caseous pneumonia
The lesions ulcerate through bronchial walls
in many places with widespread caseous
areas fusing to form larger ones. The entire
lung may appear pneumonic.
D.Tuberculoma
A nodular area of caseous necrosis with
a fibrous capsule, usually solitary and in
an upper lobe. The cut surface shows dry,
caseous areas with calcified parts.
Microscopic 
A typical tubercle consists of a central area 
of caseation necrosis surrounded by a rim of 
epithelioid cells, lymphocytes and Langhans 
giant cells with surrounding fibrosis of varying 
degrees. 
IV.Bronchiectasis
This is either localized or generalized permanent
pathological dilatation of bronchioles.
Gross
Bronchiectasis invariably affects bronchi running
in a vertical direction and is usually found in
the lower lobes. 
Dilatation may be cylindrical,
fusiform or saccular. Bronchioles also may show
mucosa! flattening. Surrounding lung tissue may
show pneumonitis. Bronchiectatic cavities are
dilated and filled with pus.Fig 14.11 : Bronchiectas1s 
Microscopic 
The mucosa may be hypertrophic or atrophic. 
There is destruction of the bronchial musculature 
and elastic tissue (causing dilation) and 
replacement by fibrous tissue in later stages. 
V. Emphysema
Gross
The lung is airy, voluminous, pale, dry and
distended. Large bullae may be formed,
especially subpleurally and more often along
the sharp edges of the lung, on the mediastinal
or diaphragmatic surfaces.
Microscopic
Thin broken alveolar septae with large, distended,
clear alveoli.
Fig. 14 12: Lung emphysema 
551 

VI.Bronchogenic Carcinoma (B.G.C.)
Gross
552 Commonly a firm, grayish white tumor arising
from a bronchus ( usually hilar in region) which
may cause blockage of the bronchus by projecting
into its lumen or pressure from the exterior.
Bronchogenic carcinoma usually infiltrates
irregularly into the surrounding lung. The
bronchial lymph nodes may show enlargement
and involvement. Secondary changes like
atelectasis, bronchiectasis and abscess formation
may be associated with it.
The overlying pleura may be thickened,
opaque and adherent. Usually epidermoid
carcinoma arise centrally, and adenocarcinomas
periphera lly. 
Microscopic
A.Epidermoid carcinoma:
Usually sheets or cords of squamous
cells. These appear like irregular large
eosinophilic cells with intracellular bridges,
mitotic figures, and epithelial pearls
(formed by keratin).
B.Adenocarcinoma:
Varying pictures are seen. Better­
differentiated varieties show single layered
tall columnar cells lining alveolar septae
with small hyperchromatic nuclei. The
cytoplasm may be pale or contain mucin.
Fig 14 13 Bronchogen1ccarcinoma PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
Mucin may also distend some alveoli. Less 
differentiated forms show hyperchromasia, 
pleomorphism and mitoses. 
C.Anaplastic carcinoma:
Sheets of small or large undifferentiated
pleomorphic cells.
4 > Small Intestine 
I.Typhoid Lesion
Gross
The small intestine, mainly ileum and ileocecal
regions are affected. There is hypertrophy of the
Peyer's patches and ulceration, the ulcers lying
along the long axis of the intestine (vertical
ulcers). Perforations may be seen.
Microscopic
The mucosa is ulcerated, and submucosa
heavily infiltrated with macrophages. There is 
hypertrophy of Peyer's patches.
II.Tuberculous Lesion
Gross
Initial lesions appear at the ileocaecal junction.
I Fig 14 14.Typhoidulcers I Fig 14 15 Tuberculous 
ulcers 

( 14 ) Pathology Specimens 
From here they spread up and down. Small 
gray tubercles appear in the Peyer's patches and 
solitary follicles, and eventually break down and 
undergo caseous necrosis forming ulcers with 
ragged undermined edges. Usually the ulcers 
are transverse. There may be small tubercles on 
the overlying serosal aspect. Stricture formation 
may be present. 
Microscopic 
The mucosa shows ulceration with typical 
tubercles extending sometimes upto the serosal 
layer. These show central caseation, with 
surrounding lymphocytes, epithelioid cells and 
Langhans type of giant cells. 
5 > Large Intestines _____ _ 
I.Amoebic Dysentery
Gross
The initial lesion shows raised areas on the
mucosa! surface, which ulcerate forming large,
irregular, ragged, flask shaped ulcers with
undermined edges. The intervening mucosa
appears normal. The overlying peritoneum is
thickened.
Microscopic
There is flask shaped ulceration with
demonstration of the trophozoite forms, which
appear as small eosinophilic bodies at the edges
of the lesion. These may be seen invading fairly
deeply.
II.Bacillary Dysentry
Gross
The lesions are usuallysuppurative with generally
Fig. 14 16. Amoebic ulcers shallow ulcers with sharp edges and an inflamed 
intervening mucosa. 
Microscopic 
There is acute pyogenic inflammation that may 
progress from edema and leucocytic infiltration 
of the mucous membrane to necrosis and 
ulceration, usually superficial. 
6 > Liver 
I.Fatty Liver
Gross
The liver is enlarged, soft, yellowish and has
rounded edges and tense capsule. The cut surface
is yellow, greasy with indistinct lobular markings.
Causes
1.Malnutrition
2.Alcoholism
3.Diabetes
4.Wasting diseases
5.Poisons
II.Cirrhosis of Liver
Gross
I I The liver may be increased or decreased
in size. The surface may be finely nodular
(micronodular) or have coarse, irregular, large
nodules (macronodular). In biliary cirrhosis,
the liver is greenish in colour.
There is resistance on cutting. The normal lobular
architecture is destroyed. There are nodules and
fibrous bands running across the cut surface.
Fig 14.17 Post necrotlC rnrhos1s 
III.Chronic Passive Congestion
Gross
The liver is normal in size, firm and dark, reddish
553 

brown in colour. The surface is finely granular 
and has thickened capsule. The cut surface would 
show mottled grayish yellow areas alternate 
with reddish brown zones. The hepatic vessels 
are dilated and may show thickened walls and 
thrombi. The typical appearance is of nutmeg 
because blackish pinpoint areas of necrosis 
alternate with yellowish area of fatty change that 
occurs due to anoxia. 
IV.Amoebic Liver Abscess
Gross
The abscess may be visible from the outer surface
or may appear as a bulge or softened area. The
cut section would show a large loculated abscess
filled with brownish "anchovy sauce" material
with an irregular shaggy wall surrounded by an
area of congestion.
V.Pyemic Liver Abscess
This resembles amebic abscess and is often
mistaken for the same. However, here there
are multiple, small, purulent and necrosed
area scattered irregularly throughout the liver
parenchyma.
VI.Hepatoma (Hepatocellular Carcinoma)
Gross
554 Hepatomas are commonly seen in cirrhotic livers.
The liver is irregularly enlarged. The tumor may
be massive, nodular and diffuse, more common
in the right lobe. There may be a single large
nodule surrounded by multiple small seedling
tumors. There may be extension into the blood
vessels or bile duct.PRACTICAL MEDICINE

Metastatic tumors are usually multinodular and 
may resemble the parent tumor. They are irregular 

{ 14 ) Pathology Specimens 
nodules showing central umbilication or pitting 
due to rapid tumor growth. Umbilication 
differentiates metastatic nodules from the large 
irregular nodules of post-necrotic cirrhosis and 
hepatomas. 
On section, usually the nodules are grayish 
white. However, they may resemble the primary 
e.g. black (melanoma metastasis), mucinous
(carcinoma colon or stomach metastasis).
7 > Kidne}! __ _ 
I.Small Contracted Kidney:
Gross:
In the final stages of chronic renal failure one
sees a small contracted kidney, the etiology of
which is difficult to make out, but the following
causes should be kept in mind.
Causes
A.Chronic glomerulonephritis
B.Chronic pyelonephritis
C.Nephrosclerosis
Distinguishable features include: 
A.Chronic glomerulonephritis: the surface is
finely granular with an adherent capsule.
The cut section shows irregularity and
atrophy of the cortex.
B.Chronic pyelonephritis: the surface is
coarsely and irregularity scarred with an
adherent capsule. The cut section shows
involvement of the cortex and medulla.
C.Nephrosclerosis -The appearance resembles
that of chronic glomerulonephritis but in
the latter the granules appear to be finer
due to the diffuseness of the lesions.
Microscopic 
A.Chronic glomerulonephritis: The glomeruli
show sclerosis of differing degrees. Few
hypertrophied glomeruli may be seen.
B.Chronic pyelonephritis: There is
periglomerular fibrosis. The tubules may
contain albumin casts. The interstitium
is infiltrated with collections of chronic
inflammatory cells.C.Nephrosclerosis: There is hyaline
degeneration, best seen in the smallest
vessels (e.g. afferent arterioles) and
a smooth, well-defined subintimal
acidophilic thickening. The internal elastic
lamina shows reduplication or splitting into
several layers.
II.Large White Kidney
GROSS
The kidney appears enlarged, smooth, pale and
soft.
Causes:
A.Amyloidosis
B.Infective subacute glomerulonephritis
C.Circulatory disturbances like renal vein
thrombosis
D.Toxemia of pregnancy
E.Degenerations and infiltrations eg fatty,
cloudy changes
F.Nephrotic syndrome
G.Leukemic infiltrations
Microscopic 
This depends on the underlying causes. 
A.Amyloidosis shows waxy pale translucent
pink deposits in glomeruli and around the
blood vessels.
B.Subacute glomerulonephritis shows
proliferation of Bowman 's capsule
epithelium forming the typical crescents.
III.Flea-bitten Kidney
f 19 14 n 'Flea rntten' kidney 
555 

Gross 
The kidney is enlarged, soft, and has a surface 
mottled with tiny dark red to blackish areas 
giving a 'flea-bitten' appearance. 
Causes 
A.Subacute bacterial endocarditis.
B. Focal thrombotic glomerulonephritis -
following bacteremia (as in endotoxic
shock), accidents of childbirth (as in
abruptio placenta and amniotic fluid
embolism) and hematological conditions
like hemolytic uremic syndrome and
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
C.DIC
D.Septicemia
E.Malignant hypertension
Microscopic 
This depends on the underlying cause. The basic 
pathology shows small focal glomerular thrombi. 
IV.Acute Glomerulonephritis
Gross
The kidney is moderately swollen and is pale
or congested. The cut section shows cortical
swelling.
Microscopic
The glomeruli are swollen and distend the
Bowman's capsule obliterating the Bowman's
space. They are hypercellular with increased
mesangial and endothelial cells.
There is stuffing of capillaries with inflammatory
cells and a few red cells.
Fig 1'! )3 Cortical necrosis PRACTICAL MEDICINE 
V.Acute Pyelonephritis
Gross
The kidneys show wedge shaped areas of
inflammation, extending through the cortex and
medulla to the pelvis, which is red and inflamed
and may contain pus.
Microscopic
There is interstitial infiltration with acute
inflammatory cells, mostly polymorphonuclear
cells.
Fig 14.24: Pyonephros1s 
VI.Polycystic Kidney
l i This is a congenital malformation, which may
involve one or both kidneys and may manifest
later in life.
Gross
The kidneys are moderately to massively
enlarged, with an irregular outline. On section,
numerous irregular, variable sized cysts filled
with greenish yellow gel may be seen. Usually
normal kidney tissue is not visible.

It is safe during pregnancy 
564 Relaxes both arteriolar and ve-
nous smooth muscles without 
any effect on the uterus or GI 
tract. It reduces the oxygen con-
sumption of myocardium. The ac-
tion is rapid in onset and of short 
duration. Hence the hypotensive 
effect is reversible on stopping 
the drug. It is useful in presence 
of Ml, pulmonary edema and dia-
betes where diazoxide is contra-
indicated. It should not be used> 
3-4days.

1-6mg/min Clonidine stimulates the alpha­
adrenergic receptors in the vaso­

inhibits the peripheral 
sympathetic activity. It, 
however, maintains renal blood 
flow. It produces refractory sodi­
um retention and therefore rapid

Catecholamine depletor: The 
exact mechanism is not known. 
It depletes 5 H.T. from CNS and 
catecholamines from peripheral 
sympathetic nerve endings in­
cluding that of heart and various 
other sites in the body. It prevents 
granular uptake (reversible) as 
well as granular storage (irrevers­
ible) of catecholamines. If given 
after MAO inhibitors or with it, it 
causes hypertension. 
1. Inhibits the transmission of 
noradrenaline at sympathetic 
nerve terminals. 
2. Depletes noradrenaline 
stores at sympathetic nerve 
endings. 
3. Blocks the re-uptake of nor­
adrenaline by sympathetic 
nerve endings. Drowsiness, depression, dry

on H.pylori reduces peptic ulcer 
relapses. 
It forms a protective layer over 
the ulcer and prevents the action 
of acid on the ulcer. 
It is a 5 HT antagonist used to pre­
vent vomiting induced by che­
motherapy. 
It is hydrolysed in small intestine 
by pancreatic lipase to glycerol 
and ricinoleic acid. Latter produc­
es purgation. 
Mechanism of action is not 
known. It acts on large bowel 
after 6-8 hrs. and produces soft 
stools. 
Exact mechanism of action is not 
known. It acts mainly on large 
bowel. 
They are retained in the G.J. tract 
where they hold considerable 
water, increasing the intestinal 
bulk, which acts as a mechanical 
stimulus increasing the intestinal 
motor activity and evacuation. 
They absorb water and swell-up 
increasing the indigestible resi­
due & provide mechanical stimu­
lus for evacuation.
